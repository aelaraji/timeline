2021-12-28T14:48:07Z	Hey! First post over here. Playing with twtxt.net, the concept with txtxt, and the Android client Goryon.
2021-12-28T16:24:04Z	(#vx4gn6q) testing a reply from Goryon
2021-12-28T18:46:50Z	Well, I'm surprised of the simple concept twtxt is, and the implications of it.‚Ä®Perhaps I don't like that's too related with Twitter, but is a powerful reference point too, so... #dealWithIt
2021-12-28T18:48:34Z	Aaand for the next text, what about the image of a decent New Year dinner? ‚Ä®‚Ä®![Image, cool](https://twtxt.net/media/eTVXsu44pSf3hc8crziP8Y)
2021-12-28T20:43:42Z	I made a Web clock in Hexadecimal. The Month, Day, Hours and Minutes are in Hex format so you can practice converting from Hex to Dec.‚Ä®‚Ä®https://gemugami.com/hexclock
2021-12-29T00:27:18Z	(#nnr7z6a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Cool! That's a nice distinction between the format, the extension, the pod and Yarn.social. Maybe the similar names are confusing to newcomers, but besides that, a really noble project. Thanks for all your effort!‚Ä®‚Ä®I was reading a little bit more about it here: https://www.prologic.blog/2021/12/19/future-of-yarnsocial.html‚Ä®‚Ä®As I was 'saying' on Twitter, this kind of extension and online services would be required for that 'social content generation', I'm glad dev.twtxt.net has those ideas covered, like pagination for instance.
2021-12-29T00:34:57Z	(#hgja5fa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you! =)
2021-12-29T00:50:19Z	(#vx4gn6q) Thanks !
2021-12-29T00:50:49Z	(#appzw6q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> xD
2021-12-29T00:51:03Z	(#appzw6q) :)
2021-12-29T14:49:08Z	Wow!, today Antenna had nice surprises and inspiring projects...‚Ä®‚Ä®How are you doing in this last week of 2021?
2021-12-29T14:56:11Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#hpzmd2a) Sure! Backwards compatibility is a huge topic (and usually something no one wants to address so it comes to us)‚Ä®‚Ä®I feel your pain, dude ‚Ä®‚Ä®For Indie Games and Webs I work on, it's about maintenance of previous versions and migration of old data to newer structures and teaching the young team how to do that. Complete fun!
2021-12-29T16:51:19Z	I was rereading a few old books in my Kindle, and reached to one about Gamification.‚Ä®‚Ä®Although I'm not a big fan of gamified experiences and serious games as I was a few years ago, it always makes me wonder on how effective they could be for simple ideas.‚Ä®‚Ä®For example I was thinking on registering your current run on a treadmill or elliptical in a twtxt file (or any Yarn service), reading it and unfolding a passive story based on your distance. ‚Ä®Or maybe exchanging those Km/Miles into some resource in a micro game.‚Ä®‚Ä®The 'final' idea is to motivate you to do more excersise, which is a long discussion.
2021-12-29T16:53:14Z	(#mch7nuq) if you are interested look for the analysis on Duolingo, on YouTube and some blogs.‚Ä®They talk on how to measure the real motivation behind the task, often forgetting about the final goal, which is learning to use a new language.‚Ä®‚Ä®Interesting readings and more interesting how to actually create that successful design
2021-12-30T02:06:13Z	Now... I'm starting to learn Rust with the famous book:‚Ä®https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book‚Ä®‚Ä®Interesting language! Let's see how it goes :)
2021-12-30T02:24:54Z	(#5yhrexq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Antenna?‚Ä®It's my favourite aggregator for Gemini:‚Ä®gemini://warmedal.se/~antenna/‚Ä®or‚Ä®https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/warmedal.se/~antenna/
2021-12-30T02:26:51Z	(#j2edwcq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Cool! I'm a complete newbie (although I use C, C#, JS, Python; if that helps), so if anyone wants to learn together, send me a reply!
2021-12-30T02:27:22Z	(#hpzmd2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Agreed! üòÖ
2021-12-30T02:33:50Z	(#nnr7z6a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> well, honest confusion from my side... ‚Ä®‚Ä®I joined here because someone requested me to use the twtxt format, which took me to https://twtxt.readthedocs.io‚Ä®I was thinking of using the base format for my site, but finding options for a simpler usage I came to https://yarn.social and lastly to https://twtxt.net‚Ä®‚Ä®So... Yes, it could be confusing if 'twtxt' (spec) is exactly the same as 'twtxt.net' (service for the same spec) when it's a (great) extension.‚Ä®Or on how to name that extension.... twtxt 2.0 to say something?
2021-12-30T02:40:28Z	(#5yhrexq) Sure!‚Ä®I give more detail here if you are interested:‚Ä®https://text.eapl.mx/re-friendly-reminder-that-antenna-runs-on-submissions‚Ä®gemini://text.eapl.mx/re-friendly-reminder-that-antenna-runs-on-submissions
2021-12-30T03:01:46Z	(#324ebwq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Moving average? Nice, what are you using it for?
2021-12-30T04:29:29Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#sddvhlq) oh, you explained about the Moving average a few tweets (?) before...‚Ä®I missed that msg! Nice, it brings me memories of a very old project to parse RSS and a few Leaderboards where I've used some statistical functions/weird math. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Good vibes with what you are doing!
2021-12-30T04:32:18Z	@<compudanzas https://compudanzas.net/tw.txt> (#k3q74ha) Looks like a nice year!‚Ä®I guess I need to work on mine too!
2021-12-30T04:38:29Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#mch7nuq) I agree‚Ä®When you tie a behavior to business metrics, like retention and revenue... Well, usually the 'game' design suffers, and sometimes the learning too. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I had a short time creating 'educational games' until I found there are not games anymore, but tools. (With a few notable exceptions) ‚Ä®They are not fun to play and if you make them fun, you don't learn in a predictable way, which is not acceptable by the industrial education. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Something similar happens with social media which are optimized for addiction buuut that's another long conv.
2021-12-30T14:28:36Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#j2edwcq) oops, it had happened the same to me with Go and C++ (And Scala, Haskell...)‚Ä®‚Ä®I love C and C#, but C++ has 'something' I've never liked... ‚Ä®‚Ä®I don't really have a reason to learn then, and I can do many similar things with other languages.‚Ä®C# for games‚Ä®Python or JS for web
2021-12-31T03:35:45Z	Ha, I found someone in Australia with the same area code than me, that casually is the same of my biz partner in USA‚Ä®‚Ä®1 in 999 perhaps üòâ‚Ä®‚Ä®#biasOfTheDay
2021-12-31T03:42:34Z	Day 2 learning #Rust‚Ä®‚Ä®I finished a Guessing game, which is very similar to an exercise to learn QBasic in 1993 (?) ha! ‚Ä®‚Ä®Nice memories by the way...

2021-12-31T14:55:26Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ltyuz3a) and about creating an instance, there is a smaller but significant community in Latin American Spanish. On Smol Net, Tilde verse, to summarize different ideas on decentralization and open sourced nets. ‚Ä®‚Ä®For example I belong to Texto-Plano (Raw Text in Spanish), I'm spreading the word there and why not, see if there are some people interested

2022-01-08T14:59:16Z	(#nwas2lq) Disclaimer: I like some parts of the Blockchain innovation, the tech possibilities. But then we arive to the knife dilemma. It can save a life or kill a person. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I dislike that Crypto (along with buzzwords of the moment like meta verse) is about money and power, so it attracts people looking for easy opportunities and scams.‚Ä®‚Ä®I think it's not a black and white.

2022-01-17T04:56:46Z	(#e5p54aq) Yep! A collection in EPUB/MOBI as an ezine, from selected posts.‚Ä®You can download the ezine from HTTP though‚Ä®‚Ä®Antenna is an aggregator for Gemini [Antenna on Gemini Protocol](gemini://warmedal.se/~antenna/)
2022-01-17T05:04:17Z	(#lc5t3zq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Still early but if you tolerate me being half asleep I could try =P‚Ä®‚Ä®What about something like 9am for you (Australia?), UTC 9pm/21, and 3pm in Mountain Time (for me)‚Ä®https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?iso=20220117&p1=65&p3=152
2022-01-17T05:11:10Z	(#i2uhejq) Running a company myself (a micro-company of fewer than 10 employees), I thought the Why, what for? Is the entire point, and the trust is 'for granted' to pursue that meaning and purpose.‚Ä®But I get your point. The trust that we are going in the same direction, makes everything work as we expect.‚Ä®‚Ä®I think there are (at least) two ways:‚Ä®The employee as a mean, or the employe as an end. Usually, the purpose of a company is to make money, and the employee is the tool (disclaimer: I don't agree completely).
2022-01-17T05:13:25Z	(#i2uhejq) For me, now, the team is extremely important, mainly for industries based on talents, like design or programming. There, trust is extremely important, because how do you measure creativity? How do you trust that the programmer is doing their best work to create a stable system?‚Ä®‚Ä®Yes, work is transactional. I work 8 hours a day, I receive X dollars a month, but also we are together because we believe and trust in the same values.
2022-01-17T05:19:37Z	(#e5p54aq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> No worries! Usually an e-zine is a fanmade or indie magazine distributed over electronic media. Zines were originally distributed by physical mail, and then by e-mail. Nowadays for the nostalgic feeling of Gemini, you can find a few Zines/Ezines there.‚Ä®‚Ä®https://text.eapl.mx/introducing-antennazine <- Why I created AntennaZINE‚Ä®https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine <- More info on the intriguing history of zines :)

2022-01-17T05:25:46Z	(#e5p54aq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> For format, do you mean using PDF files or such? I've seen blog posts, mailing lists, PDF files, and I haven't seen EPUB files that much.‚Ä®https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrack <- A famous ezine from the 80s‚Ä®‚Ä®For culture, yes, I've seen is a pattern of sharing knowledge selflessly. But also it's very unpredictable how long is going to last, or how often the issues are released.

2022-01-17T05:27:41Z	(#i2uhejq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Agreed! It's difficult as hell, but in the long run (if we survive as an indie company), it's better what you say

2022-01-17T05:36:48Z	(#e5p54aq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think it's something like grouping the best Twts of the week in a single container. Like some people create books from their blog posts or some artists create a book from the most active posts/pictures in their media.
2022-01-17T05:38:08Z	Enough internet for today, my friends üòÄ‚Ä®‚Ä®If life is given to us, see you tomorrow!
2022-01-17T18:05:28Z	These days the 'microscandal' for Jodorowsky's "Dune" bible happened. https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amansethi/spicedao-dunedao-soby‚Ä®‚Ä®It's really interesting to me how technology like crypto (whatever that means), Non-Fungible Tokens, public/private keys, etc. etc. will redefine what we define as ownership. Mainly when the ownership of digital goods and working in an online world will be greater than the physical alternatives.‚Ä®‚Ä®I wrote a few ideas about the 'isms' we require for our lives https://text.eapl.mx/quick-ideas-about-isms-and-ownership
2022-01-17T18:06:24Z	(#kt5zqfa) All that is about ownership. Of our life, our time, our resources, our destiny. 'Our' as in you and me, and as a collective society/community/organization.
2022-01-18T14:59:43Z	(#hyu3j7a) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> taking a few of the different opinions, and having discussed DRM, privacy, ownership, anarchy, copyright, and such, in class and in our creative studio, it's difficult to summarize an opinion in a few characters.‚Ä®‚Ä®I've seen of some authors avoiding digital versions for piracy reasons, and I agree.
2022-01-18T15:02:18Z	(#hyu3j7a) one of the difficulties of digital goods is the perceived value. Why is so simple to spend 2 USD (or equivalent) on a coffee and so hard to do it on a book/game/app? Our minds play tricks when we can't touch something. (For instance, in the current debate with the NFT nobody understands anything).
2022-01-18T15:04:03Z	(#hyu3j7a) In regions like mine, with low income, if I can get the book for free in 2 clicks and perhaps 10 popups, or the same content paying 10 or 25 USD (or equivalent), why do I have to lose my previous scarce money?‚Ä®‚Ä®libgen, is that you?
2022-01-18T15:07:10Z	(#hyu3j7a) When someone says is good for business, usually I ask for proof of that. As a concept sounds good. I'm getting more people aware of my content. How many of those will be actually buying the product? How many will use the free alternative instead of that money going to the author/publisher?‚Ä®‚Ä®I really understand the DRM, I get DRM-free products first, or I use any tool to unlock the content. That said, currently, indie producers rely more on customers' good faith, that they are not releasing the content to the public.
2022-01-18T15:10:12Z	(#hyu3j7a) So, conclusions. A physical book could have more perceived value and it's harder to pirate (I have looked for scanned versions of books I like, especially expensive art books, it's not the same at all).‚Ä®‚Ä®Maybe is more convenient for the author, and less for us.
2022-01-18T15:11:28Z	(#hyu3j7a) And a final reading for the weekend: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Doesn%27t_Want_to_Be_Free
2022-01-18T15:32:11Z	(#kve3wbq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I know, they (author/publisher) are not interested in giving a "non-privacy eroding garbage" in exchange for @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> 's money‚Ä®‚Ä®In some other regions, money is an issue. I don't see it here.
2022-01-18T15:33:06Z	(#kve3wbq) and what I'm explaining is that giving you a product protecting the interests of the consumer 'might' go against the interests of the producer (that usually is money)

2022-01-19T17:46:09Z	(#bwsglma) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I think Gemini has a decent size by now, and twtxt is something there... I arrived to twtxt (the format) through some users on Gemini, and lately to Yarn/twtxt.net.

2022-01-19T20:12:36Z	(#3cooobq) For the record, I hate Slack (but it's the standard for techie companies), Discord is good enough for us (giving classes, creating games for hobby and as a profession).‚Ä®Aaaand I agree Teams/Skype is the worst.

2022-01-21T13:30:08Z	(#tfad4hq) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> as you could see in my previous posts/twts, I'm in the middle between taking money from people (to pay for production expenses), and having a 'right' net (problematic word intended).‚Ä®‚Ä®If the decentralized economy 1.0 (wrongly named Web 3) is a way, I'm open to research on it, and maybe I should use it to understand more. ‚Ä®‚Ä®That said, everyone is being forced to take a stance (which is good) and have their beliefs challenged (that is usually good as well)
2022-01-21T13:33:42Z	(#tfad4hq) what I mean is that usually you have to break something to make it clear the previous way is not that great. I don't like many thinks of Web 3, what I do is showing that a better way is possible in the distant future.‚Ä®‚Ä®Now we are in the stage of: "Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."‚Ä®‚Ä®Science + Business like to break things, and that's not always for the best of humanity, that's when we need to add phylosophy to the equation (and some environmental care)

By the way I've seen slightly different behaviors between Desktop (Brave) and mobile (Firefox), like characters limits or keeping previous messages in the text box even if they were sent.

2022-01-22T00:54:41Z	Well... Friday of learning new stuff on Unity and Rust, I was forgetting what it was like to take courses for hours and be stuck.

2022-01-26T18:44:46Z	(#kwbpvsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> One part of my brain wants Yarn to stay smol, and the other likes to share this cool project/idea/product with as many people as possible. You know, the game of numbers against a sustainable big community. No matter what my brain contradicts with, the counter looks nice!
2022-01-26T18:47:25Z	(#kwbpvsq) I think I should ask before (excuse me if I missed that part of the discussion somewhere else), what's the purpose of having a counter of users? Honestly curious from a design perspective
2022-01-26T18:51:12Z	In local news you don't care about, a pigeon stepped on an electricity line, something exploded (including the pigeon) and I don't have electricity at home. It makes you think a lot...
2022-01-26T19:28:09Z	(#fqpn4qa) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> due to my background in automation and robotics, I think it's cool by itself. And for my new discipline on art and design, I think it joins the subjective aspect of art.‚Ä®‚Ä®Buuuut I think it does something similar to the Useless Boxes...‚Ä®If its purpose is to be useless, well... A nice paradox to design
2022-01-26T19:33:40Z	(#kwbpvsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> By the way, most of them are located in English speaking countries. Is anyone here interested in having one for Hispanic content? I'm in MX, BTW

2022-01-26T23:43:51Z	(#kwbpvsq) @<homer https://twtxt.net/user/homer/twtxt.txt> well... I don't have a quick answer. I'm part of Texto-Plano and the activity and members are less than 1/10 than in some other places I like. But in smol communities that's a feature not a bug, so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø‚Ä®I agree that English is the language of the Internet, the new Lingua franca, I've even written in my log about it. And even if Spanish is in the Top 10 most spoken languages, its influence is not that big in certain communities (like Dev).
2022-01-26T23:48:18Z	(#fa4qtkq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> My question goes more by: Is it interesting for someone of our acquaintances to have content in another language and from another culture?‚Ä®‚Ä®And, how to eventually support multiple languages in Yarn?. Has been a problem on Antenna, for instance, where you can't easily filter content in languages you don't know. Or maybe leaving it as English first is just OK.‚Ä®‚Ä®As a foreigner, supporting i18n has been an interest of mine, but also I know it's about working with minorities and involves #<a11y https://twtxt.net/search?tag=a11y>, so it's not an easy conversation.
2022-01-27T03:52:00Z	(#xzqnrla) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Hey, interesting link and discussion.‚Ä®I think everything was screwed up when we stopped having the concept of directories, and the resources were not files, like on some Restful APIs and such.‚Ä®‚Ä®And then the frameworks place their own ideas for managing routing.

2022-01-29T16:44:04Z	This Friday I had the chance to change the routine a bit. My wife and I watched "Mary and the Witch's Flower", it really connected with my mood.‚Ä®(Possible spoilers ahead) ~~It's a cute one, with good animation, a decent story and that bittersweet feeling of innocence and growth.~~‚Ä®(End of spoilers)‚Ä®‚Ä®Also, reading a few books in English and Spanish, including "Information Doesn't Want to Be Free". It makes you think a lot about the services and products we use and consume (like that movie I mentioned).

2022-01-30T18:35:03Z	(#teequ3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> as a fan of encryption and privacy, I think signing and encrypting messages are not only desirable but needed, I'd like to see it in action. The downside, as some have discussed is the UX pains for those clients not supporting the extension.‚Ä®On the other hand, Saltpack or PGP are great for messaging/email, I understand twtxt is not for that. In a similar way, Twitter allows private messaging in the same App, but in a different section. Same with most Social Services.
2022-01-30T18:37:14Z	(#teequ3a) I see a use case for signing messages. It could be like the Twitter verification for public messages.‚Ä®‚Ä®For encryption, as in only a few users can decrypt the message, I can't see it. Like "Sharing personal information with friends", why do you want to do that on a public channel? Use a private messaging system, or the section inside the service you use.
2022-01-30T18:42:37Z	(#teequ3a) To clarify, I was thinking before (and even discussed in TextoPlano but it had no traction) on a public channel where you store messages that anyone can read, but only a person with the private key can decrypt. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I think the concept is cool, even if I've read the security advice from Signal, Session and other IM services, about things I was forgetting on security and strong encryption. Here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1013.pdf‚Ä®‚Ä®With that said, I don't see how twtxt could be a good place for that kind of encrypted messages. Am I missing something?
2022-01-31T03:15:00Z	(#phdhdyq) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I don't want to discourage any idea, indeed I think it's a good one. I've read the whole RFC 770, so I think I understand the result, but not the why. My concern comes from the overhead of having to:‚Ä®- Manage a lot of keys (with the problems it creates of string private keys)‚Ä®- Decrypt every message once it arrives‚Ä®- Not having a way for the non-compatible browsers to hide this content.
2022-01-31T03:20:01Z	(#phdhdyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®"Same argument can be applied to Encrypted Email using GPG", IMO a more accurate one would be encrypting IRC (although you can send messages in a group/channel or in private). Email is a thing with senders and receivers. Everything on twtxt is public by default, so adding a layer of private content on top of something public first, is weird in my mind... Having a different feed sounds good, like the 'semi-public' channel idea I told in my first message.
2022-01-31T03:22:06Z	(#phdhdyq) It seems I'm missing the conversation on IRC in #<Yarn https://twtxt.net/search?tag=Yarn>.social. I'm looking forward to seeing the result of the RFC. I can't add anything else for nowüòÑ

2022-02-23T18:54:02Z	For a few years, I've been thinking about writing a book (in Spanish to start).‚Ä®‚Ä®Now I'm starting to write one on how to create a Poker Texas Hold 'em on Unity and C#...‚Ä®Let's see how it goes for this 1st experiment
2022-03-02T18:49:37Z	I've been tweeting a lot in Spanish, but had forgotten of writing here :o‚Ä®‚Ä®Don't have anything cool to share, rather than saying I'm alive and family is doing fine.
2022-03-02T18:52:58Z	(#zrpwznq) @<jan6 https://twtxt.net/user/jan6/twtxt.txt> I was thinking a lot about that.‚Ä®‚Ä®I love the series of books Head First from O'Reilly, and was considering that format.‚Ä®But for videogames, I've been taking a lot of video courses on Udemy and is much simpler to share how to use Unity, which is extremely GUI oriented.
2022-03-02T18:56:09Z	(#zrpwznq) Currently is more of 'I want to write a book' since it gives you more prestige points than a video course, and because I have done videos, podcasts, classes in college, and such, but never a book, even with the challenges you mention.‚Ä®‚Ä®And then you can write a tutorial on a Web page, create a digital book, or even a physical one. From all that I'd go with the Digital book. More ecological, easy to distribute... But a friend is telling me that Amazon has strong systems of print on demand, so it's always an option.
2022-03-02T18:57:22Z	(#zrpwznq) Note: I don't like Amazon that much, I don't buy physical books anymore, I read a lot on my kindle.‚Ä®‚Ä®That said, I'd need to know where the public is reading, and what they want to read. So it's more like designing a product for an audience, than for me. But that's something I have to decide soon.

2022-04-13T00:05:59Z	(#o3cxqba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I would pay! Since I have spare money and no free time (or will) to set up everything.‚Ä®‚Ä®I was thinking of creating my instance of Yarn.social (mainly in Spanish, since I'm using Twitter a lot to share professional stuff), but then I got to learn some stuff, and paying a few bucks is faster (for me).‚Ä®‚Ä®If I got to pay 5-10 USD for a VPS (plus my time setting up everything), and I get a service someone else is maintaining for, we say, 3 USD/month, it's a no-brainer for me. But I don't know how many people like me there are.‚Ä®‚Ä®I think the hook is in having a not so painful price point and also making it hard to stop paying for it. Example: I pay Spotify, and now I cannot cancel, since my wife and father-in-law are using it, and I want to avoid that conflict of telling them that I'm cheap, so I pay 7 USD / month, and I get music w/o ads a few times a week.
2022-04-13T00:09:00Z	(#o3cxqba) @<will https://twtxt.net/user/will/twtxt.txt> I'm surprised by Wikipedia. I know their monthly cost is impressive, and they manage to get funds to keep the lights on.‚Ä®‚Ä®I don't know the details, I think having encyclopedic universal knowledge is more worthy than a social/personal network, but no idea.

2022-04-13T16:12:53Z	(#o3cxqba) **Put my money where my mouth is!**‚Ä®‚Ä®As I've discussed previously (taken from the book 'Predictably irrational') money changes everything. From a favour now you have the obligation to keep lights on, and some predictability on how everything works.‚Ä®From a friend giving stuff for free, now you are a supplier. That's why free social networks are in that Uncanny valley of being free, but arguably you are the product. ‚Ä®‚Ä®It's an interesting experiment to charge for some part of the product (even being a non-profit). You'll see how people change. (And that's not bad, but part of self-sustainability)

2022-05-22T04:12:57Z	(#2i6b3va) @<mutefall https://twtxt.net/user/mutefall/twtxt.txt> Stupid Moore's and Koomey's laws. It's incredible to me how we have exponentially more computing power, only by waiting.‚Ä®‚Ä®Also, it's being invisible to us. We have a lot of magical systems (GPS, WiFi, Cryptography, Cell phones) and now we don't value that much what's happening behind the scenes.‚Ä®‚Ä®For me it's a matter of adapting to the current reality, and fighting against my nostalgia (everything was better before), but at the same time slowing down the stupid speed of innovation.
2022-05-24T04:14:56Z	(#5jmg2aq) There is the web3 and Web 3.0 (as a successor for Web 2.0), one more oriented to distributed and federated content, another with everything on top of a currency, so every stored bit costs some gas.‚Ä®‚Ä®And although I don't dislike the good parts of cryptocurrency, being the cryptography behind it and the potential of decentralized power behind it, I'm not too fond of the interests it brings. Since it's designed from the core for monetary value, it attracts people aiming for the best Return on investment not caring for the environment (there is a debate about green energies by 2022).‚Ä®‚Ä®I know that a Hobbyist net, an Indieweb, and a Hyper profitable net are going to be different between them, their core values are different, and there is a space for all of them. ‚Ä®I don't think Web3 is going to be self-sustainable since there is no balance between losers and winners.
2022-05-24T04:16:42Z	(#5jmg2aq) I won't say it's important to kill them. How are we going to do it?‚Ä®‚Ä®I think it's going to implode itself since it doesn't have the benefits of a Hobbie, with people sustaining the infrastructure for the sake of it.‚Ä®Nor the self-sustainability of a commercial net, where the profits are higher than the cost of operating them.
2022-05-24T13:30:26Z	(#vbtd5ba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well, it should be decentralized, like in every computer having a copy of the whole blockchain (400 GB for Bitcoin up to 2022). Since that's not feasible, now everything is semi-decentralized or fully centralized, and perhaps is not been distributed, if you consume the blockchain on the same APIs... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø‚Ä®‚Ä®So I agree with you.
2022-05-24T13:37:46Z	(#vbtd5ba) What I think about those technologies is that version 1.0 is extremely inefficient (energy consumption, niche market), have horrible UX (like slow transactions, having to centralize the transactions to make them easier to use) and requires some early adopters willing to ignore the defects of the current solution. ‚Ä®‚Ä®So it's a double edged sword to me. Yeah, changing the status quo, and using cool technology is appealing to scientists (AI/magical algorithms, is that you?), but the problems it actually creates are worth considering. It reminds me of a quote from Jurassic Park.‚Ä®‚Ä®Maybe Web3.5 will fix some, maybe everything will disappear. Who knows?

2022-06-11T18:44:17Z	On Mastodon and Podcasts (in Spanish) there was a discussion about consuming blogs on RSS. Besides podcasting, RSS has been dead for me, or at least I've had many years without actively using it.‚Ä®‚Ä®Today for research purposes I opened The Old Reader with my account of 2010 and it was a blast of nostalgia, old blogs, content creators and even relatives sharing their content about 12 years ago... #<dontTryThisAtHome https://twtxt.net/search?tag=dontTryThisAtHome>
2022-06-11T18:47:35Z	(#2hlggeq) Haha, this is gold! I love the sarcastic tone.‚Ä®‚Ä®I think RSS switched to Social Media, then to email newsletters, but I agree with @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> on being mainly for the lack of discoverability in browsers.‚Ä®‚Ä®On Gemini I use Antenna, or even Telegram channels to push the content to me. I don't know, I'm not an avid consumer of blogs, and that's perhaps the reason I don't like to receive content in aggregators. IDK.
2022-06-11T18:52:27Z	(#2hlggeq) Another point is that with RSS you don't control what you receive. I was getting hundreds of new entries, generating a sense of _this is too much_. When I visit a site like Hacker News, I look over the last day, and it's OK if I miss content from weeks ago.‚Ä®‚Ä®Being a fan of Inbox Zero, I like to unsubscribe from content not attractive to me or only receive a weekly summary (like that from IndieHackers.com). With RSS I feel I receive a push of **everything** the blog has created.‚Ä®‚Ä®But again, I haven't used it in years.
2022-06-11T20:04:48Z	(#2hlggeq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Interesting, it reminds me a bit of twtxt, where the content and the notifications are in a single file

Perhaps allowing up to 100 or 200 chars is good enough, and maybe rejecting some special characters like emojis, no idea.

2022-08-05T02:59:45Z	I'm thinking of starting (another) Side project / Hobby project. Also, I've been writing about my projects (mostly games) in the last few years. For me, it's a source of learning, validation and portfolio, but I have bitter-sweet feelings on the results.‚Ä®‚Ä®I have mixed feelings, since when it's a Hobby project is not a big deal leaving it 'incomplete', without users, and such. But as a Side project which could at least earn some bucks to pay the expenses, there is some pain in not having traction as a product.‚Ä®‚Ä®Any general advice?
2022-08-06T00:46:30Z	(#7ldrcdq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> interesting question. When I reached the drawing board I got the same question. Should we register everything? Calories, distance, steps, time and such?‚Ä®‚Ä®I thought it was going to be tedious to type every kind of info, so I went down to a single number representing I did any exercise, being the final goal to do more.‚Ä®‚Ä®It was burned calories for me...
2022-08-06T00:52:40Z	(#7ldrcdq) So unless you have an automatic way to store all that geeky data, I'll suggest to ask for the min amount of numbers.‚Ä®‚Ä®That said, anything user-configurable is a pain in the back since you have to add editors, validators, tutorials and such. I wouldn't do it yet, unless you have a paying user or similar. Perhaps you can add 2 or 5 presets which you can rename for general purposes. And then you store the amounts for that activity and have an equivalent number across exercises, again, like calories.
2022-08-06T01:03:33Z	(#7ldrcdq) To avoid premature optimization you can have room for further expansions but not implementing it yet. For instance saying "this record is version 1" if it's V2, then look into this other table with more details.‚Ä®‚Ä®Just a wild idea, it would depend on your current architecture and how much it could change soon

2022-08-23T13:11:53Z	(#oa3m5qa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well... I got to start with a disclaimer, I'm a content creator and a content consumer/user.‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm not receiving anything from my content but it would be nice. I live in a hobbyist network (creating and consuming paying with time) and in the commercial one as well. I pay for some content and don't pay for some other. I use uBlock and Vanced. I get frustrated when in groups of 'profesional' people, books and magazines are shared shamelessly. I pay for Spotify, and I download music from YouTube. I hate the first 2 minutes of ads and bumpers. I have read "Information doesn't want to be free" and I know there is a fight between everything online has to be open vs closed and paywalled.‚Ä®‚Ä®All that said, well... The problem is deeper, comes again from the recommendation algorithms shaping our lives and that's the real danger. That's why instead of organic or automatic recommendation, they need the subscription, to avoid their channel being forgotten due to 527 videos before and short-term memory.
2022-08-23T13:14:53Z	(#oa3m5qa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I agree with the last part, it happens with Spotify and some streaming platforms. You pay for it and you receive ads, like with some magazines.‚Ä®‚Ä®I think the first step is not consuming that content, next one is to fomplain, and las part is becoming a monk and stop using digital content < /s>

Not having to actually remember a password.‚Ä®‚Ä®I've been playing with https://spectre.app although I think having to remember a Master Password + your accounts makes it difficult to use for the average user. You have to remember how exactly the username is stored, or... Having a vault again.‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm thinking more of getting a Dynamic password, like a 9 digits OTP or similar, with seeds/keys stored in some device, like we actually do for 2FA/TOTP.

2022-09-16T20:46:11Z	#<stupidIdeaOfTheDay https://twtxt.net/search?tag=stupidIdeaOfTheDay> (based on one I found randomly on Reddit)‚Ä®‚Ä®To avoid using Static passwords + TOTPs (like Google Authenticator codes), have a dynamic Single-factor authentication:‚Ä®Sign the time (in blocks of 30 seconds like with TOTPS) with your private key, so you have passwords valid for 30-90 seconds. Allow at most 10 attempts every 30 seconds. Obviously, the server checks a valid signature with your registered public key.‚Ä®For this, you can use an extension for your password manager as you are already doing to manage your static passwords + your TOTPs.‚Ä®‚Ä®Similar to what Yubikey originally did. There are many weak points like Man in the middle, and phishing, and possible attacks over a known message, that were solved with WebAuthn, but it's a nice exercise to think about.‚Ä®Disclaimer: Don't roll your own crypto‚Ä®Disclaimer 2: Don't implement 1FA, if you can do 2FA or MFA =P

2022-09-23T22:17:14Z	(#peh3rea) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> It looks like this over here ![](https://twtxt.net/media/rNrrVNjrwZ7CeSNCg7tVvi.png)
2022-09-24T12:10:21Z	(#7fs3pwq) @<movq https://uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> interesting point.‚Ä®Perhaps you've seen the official take [title](url) [Firefox removes core product support for RSS/Atom feeds | Use Tables!] (https://www.gijsk.com/blog/2018/10/firefox-removes-core-product-support-for-rss-atom-feeds/) ‚Ä®‚Ä®"These features have long had outsized maintenance and security costs relative to their usage", which amounted to 0.01 percent of sessions.‚Ä®‚Ä®Which could be innacurate since most power users disable telemetry.‚Ä®Anyway, for some reason, most mainstream browsers avoid supporting Feeds, and I think it's a matter of advertising and trends. We could use a plugin/extension tho.
2022-09-24T12:15:20Z	(#7fs3pwq) personally, I haven't used Feeds like I used to do 10+ ago. I don't care about following blogs anymore, but following people and topics (on Twitter, Twtxt, etc) and curated content (newsletters, a bit of pinterest...), I don't read news anymore. I listed to a lot of podcast but the directories get the Feed URL for me. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Perhaps that's a bad habit remaining from social media usage. Changing how I consume/get periodic content. Makes me think ü§î
2022-09-24T12:17:28Z	(#gsewnyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> if _influence_ (c) is motivating to twt more often, I guess it's a good influence üòõ
2022-09-24T12:21:51Z	(#gsewnyq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> interesting, kudos for the hard work.‚Ä®‚Ä®Saying something obvious here, I think twtxt as a plain text format is so easy to create but not so easy to consume and extremely hard to use as a conversations tool.‚Ä®‚Ä®It's missing the famous 'network effect' to hook into real conversations. So it could transform into a communication protocol, rather than a timed text format.
2022-09-24T12:26:09Z	(#gsewnyq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> I've seen much more than 9 Gemini accesible twtxt files, perhaps the capsules are down? ü§î‚Ä®‚Ä®Also, what's the difference between found and accessible? Being linked in any page counts as found and then the link being broken makes it non accesible?
2022-09-24T12:32:53Z	(#7fs3pwq) @<movq https://uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> yeah, I agree on the Feed icon and discoverability in general, following the trend that most web 2.0 services stopped supporting RSS (in 2010 I think?).‚Ä®Again, it's like they don't want the common user to know that exists, perhaps for not promoting browsing the web but an alternative way to consume content (hiding most ads in the process)‚Ä®‚Ä®And then Firefox includes Pocket, which is the first thing I disable üôÉ
2022-09-24T12:39:25Z	(#7fs3pwq) I read about it a few years ago... http://camendesign.com/blog/rss_is_dying‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm thinking if by 2022 that has changed significantly (at least it's not RSS anymore, but Atom and other hipster formats, I'm talking about Feeds as a concept)
2022-09-24T12:42:11Z	(#peh3rea) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I did! Just wanted to share the surprise in case is rendered differently here‚Ä®‚Ä®Great work with that XSLT!

2022-09-24T15:23:37Z	(#7fs3pwq) If I can add something, I disable now all the Home Pages with news. I don't care about them anymore, but I like models like Reddit/HackerNews/Lobste.ts/Antenna.‚Ä®‚Ä®More in the model "I'll check them when I want, not when you are pushing it to me"‚Ä®‚Ä®But that's another discussion.
2022-09-24T15:30:40Z	(#7fs3pwq) For people born after the 90s (no one here I suppose), this was Active Desktop:‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/GhYNuB3TxhtMmWUQ7TT9LZ.png) ‚Ä®Instead of a static image, show a Dynamic Web page refreshed every X minutes.

2022-09-24T18:31:33Z	(#gsewnyq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> Really interesting. What origin points you had? twtxt.net for instance?
2022-09-24T18:39:03Z	(#gsewnyq) I'm in #<236 https://twtxt.net/search?tag=236> (with a forgotten .txt I'm not planning to use anymore) and #<31 https://twtxt.net/search?tag=31> with this account. The one I started a few days ago is not there: https://eapl.mx/twtxt.txt (I'm not complaining :P)‚Ä®‚Ä®How do you find interconnections? With follows and mentions?
2022-09-24T18:47:33Z	(#sax4t6a) @<movq https://uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Active Desktop and Channels were related but the latter is more related to RSS, on receiving new content automatically. Active desktop was only showing a web page. ‚Ä®‚Ä®If I remember correctly, Internet Explorer 4.0 introduced a 'standard' to get low-bandwidth notifications to know when new content was available, but I can't recall if it were only the notification, or if you can read everything there, as you can do with RSS: [Push technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology)‚Ä®‚Ä®Edit: I found it [Channel Definition Format](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Channel_Definition_Format)
2022-09-24T19:12:55Z	Related with my current conversation, what do you think of using twtxt.txt as a format for feeds?‚Ä®‚Ä®Indeed I knew the format since it was used in Gemini capsules as a sort of Atom alternative
2022-09-25T04:24:28Z	(#wdu6cca) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> hey! CodeMadness.org has amazing projects üòÄ
2022-09-25T11:50:15Z	(#wdu6cca) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I guess I didn't say it correctly.‚Ä®‚Ä®I didn't know about that page, it's cool! ‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®About how do they use Twtxt as a feed, I agree on the problem you mention, and of the lack of a convention (unless we use the title/subject as someone suggested later) for automated parsing
2022-09-26T04:21:42Z	(#c4rokma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's late over here, I'll try to take a look in the week but I briefly checked it since criptography has been a hobby interest for me.‚Ä®‚Ä®That said, I think https://getsession.org or Jami, are more related to Salty than Signal.
2022-09-27T00:38:32Z	(#c4rokma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I can't disagree, although if you read both proposals, they have some similarities on goals, use of libraries, anonymity and such. Anyways my bet is on all of you üòÄ‚Ä®‚Ä®https://getsession.org/lightpaper
2022-09-27T02:03:36Z	(#hsouiwa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I get it. I think in the past we had the discussion about centralization, decentralization, distributed and even federated. It's an important distinction. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I haven't read the Signal documentation, only used it (and then I moved to Telegram and Session). That said, why do you say or think that Salty is similar to Signal?‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm suspecting of being more recognized as a brand that other hipster solutions, is that the case?

2022-10-05T13:05:27Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> (#6m74qpq) as a developer, well, in some way I like from some platforms to feel pressured to update, othrteidr you'll never find time to do it, but at the same time you do the barely minimum to comply with the reqs.‚Ä®‚Ä®That said, yes, I see a planned obsolescence in everything. For instance the topic in my industry today was the discontinuation of Amazon Game Sparks so many important games won't have online matches until the Devs achieve replace on a rush the online system. (I mean in a rush since it's not a priority until it occurs)

2022-10-06T02:18:05Z	(#7yh73ia) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, I'll only add that Bitcoin as the 'first' massive cryptocurrency is a vast social experiment, appealing to me as a hacker.‚Ä®‚Ä®But as with many 'successful' experiments it's going out of control. Currently, there are 9k+ different cryptocurrencies, each one trying to improve over the previous, or at least promising new things, and that's where the promises are not going to be fulfilled. It's easiest to promise a nicer future than to actually achieve it.‚Ä®‚Ä®I can't say every crypto + currency system is evil or good. That's ideology, oversimplification appealing to our emotions. 'Money is the root of all evil' is BS, the real quote is 'the love of money is the root of all evil'. I'll say it's the same for Cryptocurrencies. Fanaticism and cult behaviour is the bad part IMO.
2022-10-06T02:21:18Z	(#7yh73ia) As with the example of the gun, designed to kill people, vs the knife to cook, that could be used to kill someone. Money is not moral, but the monetary systems are. That's the tricky part.‚Ä®‚Ä®As a scientist, I always have to remind: "Scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."‚Ä®That's where 'good' intentions like Google with the "don't be evil" motto, suddenly, get evil. A search engine is cool. A whole company designed to sell users' data, not so much. The same thing with anything to store value, it's tightly connected with power, and that *may* show the worst part of humans.

2022-10-06T19:42:53Z	(#fh6ymua) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Interesting, let me see...‚Ä®‚Ä®1. I'm out of context, why do we need this? (As a community of users and developers, I think)‚Ä®‚Ä®2. I'm reading:‚Ä®```‚Ä®The goal is to provide a database that can be fetched periodically to receive a‚Ä®list of twtxt feed URLs that are known to be wrong for whatever reason.‚Ä®```‚Ä®'Wrong for whatever reason' is too vague in my mind, doesn't help me to understand how it's useful, I think specific reasons would be better like 'File name changed', 'Domain changed', 'URL not available anymore/Gone forever' and such could be easier to understand.‚Ä®‚Ä®3. What would happen if two URLs have changes, you take the most recent one?‚Ä®‚Ä®4. Who's gonna be the main user? Systems like Yarnd checking for changes to auto-correct broken links?‚Ä®‚Ä®These are my first impressions, and not wanting to say something wrong, it looks appealing. Kudos for the initiative!
2022-10-06T19:47:55Z	(#fh6ymua) Another one, when a resource is available in multiple places, like Gopher, HTTP and Gemini (and IPFS, why not?), are there going to be N registries?‚Ä®‚Ä®Wild idea, how about using the HTTP response codes https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status or from Gemini https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi‚Ä®‚Ä®Like 308/31 for redirections, 410/52 for Gone and such

2022-10-08T01:11:32Z	@<~eaplmx https://texto-plano.xyz/~eaplmx/twtxt.txt> (#46rqmia) I forgot to add, in the Sign up you don't need a password currently, that will be used later to avoid that anyone could register their device as a valid login.‚Ä®‚Ä®Also, this is a sandbox, don't take this workflow as an inspiration for any production ready site.

2022-10-10T14:51:07Z	(#npkkadq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> well, not 100% right but it's a valid assumption.‚Ä®‚Ä®If you are able to reset your password by email, it's a pretty similar level of security than receiving an access token by email. Anyone with access to your mail could get access to your accounts.‚Ä®Adding a second factor of authentication could help, or using something with Public/Private cripto would be better, like Client Certs, Fido2 or even hipster things.‚Ä®‚Ä®And also giving alerts that someone else is connected in your behalf is great (like is done for some banks or Google) , but that's a UX compromise between convenience and security.
2022-10-10T14:57:07Z	(#npkkadq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Nice!‚Ä®‚Ä®I didn't know about https://indieauth.net which seems to be based on OAuth 2.0 (that I have used before), I'll take a look!
2022-10-10T15:12:01Z	(#i5sbxnq) @<walves https://twtxt.net/user/walves/twtxt.txt> hey walves!‚Ä®‚Ä®I assume you have created an account on twtxt.net and you can see this message.‚Ä®‚Ä®What have you used on Windows? The twtxt client on Python? (it's broken on newest versions of python), if you want your .txt file to be available publicly you could host it in some server or running the twtxt client from some tilde or VPS. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Or use Twtxt.net (which is a Yarn.social server) to manage following other users, receiving mentions, replying to other twts, and such. It creates and serves the text file for you, from a web and mobile interface. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Or you can use various clients (from a terminal) to insert net lines (twts) to the file, and also to read other users' files. Newest versions have extended the protocol to allow replies, hashtags and such.‚Ä®‚Ä®I use both, in English I like twtxt.net/yarn.social since it's easy to talk as a community. In Spanish I use the traditional approach of hosting a file, more like a micro log.
2022-10-10T16:16:26Z	(#npkkadq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'd like to have a 2FA alternative, at least TOTP (what Google Authenticator uses).‚Ä®And if you have support for WebAuthn, even better.‚Ä®Both are self-hostable.

2022-10-11T15:06:27Z	(#avd45ka) @<movq https://uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> is it perhaps a Hacker mindset of breaking things?‚Ä®‚Ä®I was reading on Hacker News the other day about the collide of different personalities in the same space. Those wanting to give maintenance to existing systems (the stereotype of IT guy), the hackers (breaking stuff because why not) and the developers (building thinks to solve problems).‚Ä®‚Ä®And in an environment of earning money to make a living. Everything together sounds like a recipe for a very 'fun' place to work.
2022-10-11T16:00:42Z	(#avd45ka) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> there is, the issue is making those 3 to work together in a semi-cooperative environment. It's possible with the right incentives

2022-10-11T16:29:46Z	(#npkkadq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> sure! I'm working on a proof of concept (in PHP) if you want to take a look on how it works
2022-10-11T16:30:45Z	(#npkkadq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt>  that said, WebAuthn/FIDO 2/PassKeys are not that easy to implement but I think they have many improvements for the Authentication problem
2022-10-11T16:35:07Z	(#npkkadq) You can take a look at the library I'm using, here:‚Ä®https://eapl.mx/webauthn/_test/client.html‚Ä®‚Ä®And the implementation there:‚Ä®https://eapl.mx/twtxt/login.html‚Ä®‚Ä®What's missing in the examples is having an identity tied to your Auth device (Hardware token or OS service like Microsoft Hello, Apple Keychain, Android Fingerprint). The explanation is long, but the abstraction is there. Your identity and private certificates are held for you by some 'magic' device.
2022-10-11T17:52:35Z	(#npkkadq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Well, it took me like 4 hours to set up, implement and test the PHP library, with all the setup combinations, devices and such.‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/vHDDNhT4YdPQafPFb43SaM.png) ‚Ä®‚Ä®So I'll say that using a password with a simple function like https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php‚Ä®is much easier than a whole library requiring communication between the server, the browser and the auth device...

2022-10-12T22:43:40Z	(#ffh253a) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> yep, I get it. At least Edge is like Safari, being integrated into the OS. I'll need to research more about that spyware you mention (I have all Windows 10 settings to avoid telemetry, and perhaps spy-wares, but I only believe is not sending that info).‚Ä®‚Ä®Disclaimer: I have a distinction between opt-in semi-anonymous telemetry and spyware, but I get the point.
2022-10-12T22:44:47Z	(#ffh253a) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> About LibreWolf I like it, but the default behaviour breaks my normal usage, so I need to find a good compromise for it.

2022-10-13T12:37:46Z	(#kzl6yiq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> well, as they say‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®Is heavier than gopher‚Ä®Is lighter than the web‚Ä®Will not replace either‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®I think it has many different things to enounce, some ideological, some practical. Some that I like and some others I don't share that much.‚Ä®Some people will like the limitations, some others the encryption by default, and I guess some more will like the nostalgic factor of the Web of the 90s.‚Ä®‚Ä®As a hacker, I like that is a 'modernized Gopher' with some inspiration taken from the Web, and it's something you can actually program with a few libraries in your favourite language, so it's a toy protocol which someone else is actually going to use. Trying to develop something on HTTP 2 or 3 nowadays seems impossible.‚Ä®‚Ä®Having connections encrypted by default and using login by client certificates is appealing to my crypto side, although really optional (in fact there is an alternative without encryption that I can't recall the name by now)
2022-10-13T12:43:14Z	(#kzl6yiq) What I love about all that is Gemtext, in my opinion, a streamlined Markdown.‚Ä®[Full spec](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/gemtext.gmi)‚Ä®[Quick reference](https://smol.pub/gemtext)‚Ä®‚Ä®I use it for my blog, renders well enough to HTML, it's extremely easy to remember, and it's easy to parse. Again, minimalism in the markup language, in the protocol, and finally in the communication. ‚Ä®‚Ä®And I knew of twtxt on Gemini (it's used there as a simplified feed format), so I'm here thanks to that hipster protocol üòÅ

2022-10-17T16:07:02Z	(#ywuerzq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> well, the main point is not replacing the web and not having a critical mass is a feature, is OK if only my 3 friends read what I wrote.‚Ä®‚Ä®In fact has been surprising it wasn't forgotten into indifference but is being actively used.
2022-10-17T16:11:08Z	(#zukeuga) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> hmm, you can pay for ad-less pages and services. If you are browsing for free, I'd expect to see some ads.‚Ä®‚Ä®Previously we payed for magazines and still received ads. Now we have 'free' services exchanging our data and attention for content. We can read more on how we reached there in "Information doesn't want to be free" ‚Ä®‚Ä®So, my shortcut has been, pay for the services, use adblockers for everything else.
2022-10-17T16:13:53Z	(#zukeuga) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> connecting my previous twts together, if behind Chrome there is Google, willing to make an Operating System for the Web and Mobiles, they'll have incentives to do it so, pushing a lot of money/investment to the massive users. (And an investment has an expected return on investment) ‚Ä®‚Ä®What could we do against those huge corporations? That's the interesting and hard question
2022-10-17T16:34:16Z	(#zukeuga) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> well, I remember Reader's Digest throwing whole catalogues to my Grandpa along with the magazines he had already paid for.‚Ä®They had his address and credit card info with promotions like "only send this message and you'll receive the next book".‚Ä®And for Flashing videos, we could go to Public TV broadcasting.‚Ä®‚Ä®But I get your point, and I add. "If the 'product' is free, you are the product". And those companies are trying to productize you. Manifest V3 is a clear example of the Status quo, disguised as "for your convenience".‚Ä®‚Ä®The real point is not being part of that "Society of complaining" but being key to actually change what bothers us.
2022-10-17T16:39:45Z	(#zukeuga) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Talking about government is a rabbit hole. What I don't like is talking about it like the magic silver bullet that will solve all the problems and become a religion and ideology... ‚Ä®‚Ä®And it's not only a matter of experimental post-capitalism but more about pragmatical solutions. We have about 30-60 years more here. What are we gonna do in those years? As individuals, as families, as communities, as nations, as a whole planet?
2022-10-17T16:55:34Z	(#zukeuga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yep, that's part of the game of power. Why would you like to join that corrupt environment if wouldn't it be to take advantage of the system?‚Ä®‚Ä®And the Politicians are a public image for 4 or 6 years, who's behind them? Who's paying the politicians to do the dirty work?‚Ä®‚Ä®So, this is the way humans have lived for many, many years. There are going to be rebels like you and me, trying to 'fix' things (pushing to our aspirations), but there is always going to be that fight, IMO‚Ä®‚Ä®It's not an easy conversation, I have to say. Even writing this is controversial. The easiest path would be saying "Yeah, it sucks bro", and not doing anything.
2022-10-17T18:06:30Z	(#zukeuga) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I know, tell us about the post-capitalist alternative that our generation could experience. How is it?
2022-10-17T18:08:02Z	(#zukeuga) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> nop, that's not what I meant. And I don't like unproductive ways to think or to talk, so that is something you assumed.‚Ä®(Also I don't want to be obsessed with productivity, but that's another discussion)
2022-10-17T19:40:31Z	(#zukeuga) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I don't disagree, in fact, families are my favourite community right now (perhaps I'm lucky for that).‚Ä®‚Ä®That said, it has been difficult to work with my family. When you involve money into a family problems appear.‚Ä®‚Ä®There is even this meme  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/HvEEtMqPrtUJofqCGvTX36.png)
2022-10-17T19:45:55Z	(#zukeuga) So, it's not a matter of Capitalism, but of greediness and money. (And just to check, capitalism is not about money, money is not the evilness here, but how we work for it)‚Ä®‚Ä®So, Money + Families is a difficult combination. Check this research on psychology applied to money and free stuff: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational#Being_Paid_vs._A_Friendly_Favor‚Ä®‚Ä®Yes, we could try living in communes, having co-ops, and other experimental post-capitalist alternatives. I don't know what could happen.
2022-10-17T19:47:22Z	(#zukeuga) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> On gifts, I guess our mind has a problem with the Free concept, (as in freedom, as in culture, as in something you can steal).‚Ä®‚Ä®Last year I found an appealing reading on the topic of Open Software as a gift.

2022-10-19T13:50:32Z	(#wbjwkzq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> about being Turing complete, do you think that's still something useful?‚Ä®‚Ä®I mean, we could define Brainfuck as Turing complete, and we have strong discussions on the subject https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/315924‚Ä®‚Ä®IMO newcomers don't want the most optimized and engineered way to code, but what's easier to start with. If a Spreadsheet allows me to calculate something, that's a programming language for them!‚Ä®‚Ä®Im trying to be empathic with the learning curve. I don't like the verb code as a synonym of programming, but I need an English word for: "Being able to make a computer do what I want", code is the interface for that
2022-10-19T13:55:08Z	I'm trying to learn French for 3rd or 4th time in my life, and it's seems more seriously now (I have a class with a native teacher 1 hr/week, 30 minutes of practice energy day on apps)‚Ä®‚Ä®It's not completely immersive, I know. I've been doing that since March, and as @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> said recently, it takes many hours to have some level of confidence in that knowledge!
2022-10-19T13:57:47Z	(#pl2t3wa) I remember a friend from the work, who studied German for 3 years, and when we were there he was unable to talk with a girl. Weird... And me, with my 2 months learning, only could say a few words to random people.‚Ä®‚Ä®It's happening similar with ```vim``` I'm practicing 30 minutes a day, and I hope in a few months I'll be able to barely edit a file with the confidence of VS Code/Sublime
2022-10-19T13:59:52Z	(#pl2t3wa) as a friend told me: What makes sense tomorrow is not making sense while you are learning it. But you won't know it until you master it.‚Ä®‚Ä®Weird feeling, but as a professor and as a permanent student, I think that's how it is. What do you think?
2022-10-19T14:06:24Z	(#wbjwkzq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®As I was discussing on the evil microblogging, with a friend fan of ASM, real programming doesn't exist, you make your own microprocessors and write the machine code in binary with electric signals...

I don't know what to say than, we could decide not to be the product.
2022-10-20T01:07:54Z	(#tnbwxta) but that's difficult in countries like mine where you can get data plans with free access to the mainstream social media, Meta, TT, and such, obviously subsidized by ads and payed to the carriers.‚Ä®‚Ä®I don't want to only comply, but I can't find an easy way to fix that.

2022-10-20T16:29:09Z	(#xuaevqq) I switched from Sublime to VS Code in 2018 (?), due to some errors on Sublime 3.‚Ä®It's a bittersweet feeling. Sublime 'invented' that UX and Atom/VS Code took that innovation, offering a free alternative. The Show all commands bar (Ctrl-Shift-P) is just amazing, easy to use and useful.‚Ä®‚Ä®Moral feelings away, I have good productivity with VS Code, I don't have to install many plugins, and it's quick to start from 0. In a pragmatic way VS Code just works.‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm also learning vim and nvim and it has been a complex learning curve, but I think it's going to help me as vim is installed almost everywhere. Perhaps helix is going to become an opinionated alternative for VS Code users soon, no idea.‚Ä®‚Ä®As they say, a quick way to get a good product is "Standing on the shoulders of giants", and sometimes using those ideas/stealing is part of that standing.

2022-10-22T02:10:36Z	(#xskfpea) I've seen that if you open the app when you are not connected to the Internet for some reason (for instance I use the aeroplane mode a lot) it forgets the login info.‚Ä®‚Ä®Other than that, the session usually lasts a lot (I haven't tested it but I could say that lasts more than a week)
2022-10-22T03:22:48Z	(#xskfpea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yep, it's something tricky about coding mobile apps. What I've done is having backup URLs like https://1.1.1.1 or those that Google and Android use to redirect to Public Access points (I can't recall the URLs now, I'll what to look for them) to check if the device has connection.‚Ä®‚Ä®About Goryon, I think the app wouldn't have to delete/forget the API token until it actually knows the token is invalid ü§î

I guess so, b/c it's not only a name (which is a brand), but the recipe to reach to that smell. It's not so fair under the current IP legislation that someone else can use your work and sell the same perfume as theirs. Would it be plagiarism IMO. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Again, it's polemic, but in this specific case I think people don't understand what's behind licensing a Pantone.‚Ä®‚Ä®I leave a discussion on that: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33370265
2022-10-29T13:22:26Z	(#lt34ixq) Aaand that's because Pantone is more about the physical ink to reach that color than the RGB/Hex value and name for it.‚Ä®‚Ä®Is unfair that Photoshop charges you for something that previously was free?

2022-10-29T13:42:37Z	(#sjv7a5a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Thanks for sharing.‚Ä®‚Ä®Usually I don't like to rant against the government but this one, aaargh!‚Ä®‚Ä®70%+ of the Mexicans don't like the DST, Americans neither. So the last few months it has been a thing here. But the timing, Damn!‚Ä®‚Ä®In fact, if you don't tell me I didn't know! Has finished to be official just yesterday, 2 days before the DST change! And now ICANN has made the change really quickly, I'm gladly surprised. I was betting that they wouldn't have time to react. ‚Ä®‚Ä®That said I think it's gonna be like with Chile üá®üá± a few months ago. They had a similar rushed change and all the systems where broken and patches had to me deployed for the calendars.‚Ä®‚Ä®</r>‚Ä®‚Ä®Well. That said, I'm in Chihuahua, so my timezone will sync the center of the country which is good, and we are reverting changes from my childhood, haha.
2022-10-29T13:44:34Z	(#lt34ixq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yeah, subscriptions are insane. I understand why do companies need them.‚Ä®‚Ä®But the way it's worded "We charge you periodically for your convenience" is irritating.

2022-10-29T13:52:27Z	(#sjv7a5a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> and yeah, the current administration (leftist populist) is proposing half-baked laws for everything. So... What can I say?‚Ä®‚Ä®My state is in the border but my city don't. So it's gonna be a mess if I have to work with friends close to the border. There isn't even a Mexican Timezone for them, so I'll have to pick one from USA.‚Ä®‚Ä®Basically this current map is gonna change completely...

2022-10-29T13:58:21Z	(#lt34ixq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> this üëÜ
2022-10-29T14:00:25Z	(#dd3wnxq) I was thinking about it the other day.‚Ä®Twtxt spec requires the Z (Zulu) Timezone. But what about posting the local time, and the server/client makes the conversions.‚Ä®‚Ä®That's even better if you travel around and your local Timezone changes often.
2022-10-29T14:03:10Z	(#sjv7a5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> üëÜ this is Spanish BTW üòÜü§£

2022-10-29T14:06:54Z	(#dd3wnxq) Then you can show the Timezone based on the last Twt. Is not as specific as having a ICANN Timezone, but I think is precise and dynamic enough.
2022-10-29T14:09:43Z	(#ykkayea) Hehe, I've just checked. I mean saving that value IN the twtxt.txt file in each twt (I don't know it that break things, I guess so) ‚Ä®‚Ä®I've used the Yarn local Timezone setting and works great! üëåIt's accurate with my (current) time zone
2022-10-29T14:12:59Z	(#sjv7a5a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> yep üôÇ‚Ä®It's gonna be a funny week over here.‚Ä®But it's the Weekend, my future me is fixing that on Monday üòâ
2022-10-29T14:24:57Z	(#dd3wnxq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> no worries, my point goes on saving the Timezone on the Twtxt file, instead of adding a Metadata (which is going to be outdated if you travel to another Timezone)‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/72JJ8LXbXoyKC7VzAZKYGX.png)
2022-10-29T14:27:02Z	(#dd3wnxq) That way, the CLI tool or Yarn could take the current Timezone convert it to your local time and say "this user has this Timezone, is X hours behind you, it's 4am for them"
2022-10-29T14:29:23Z	(#dd3wnxq) I'm reading in a twtxt spec that the time offset is allowed and I remember somewhere else asks to use the Z timezone (UTC). I'm confused now.‚Ä®‚Ä®https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/twtxtfile.html#format-specification
2022-10-29T18:28:57Z	(#7usypfq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> I could suggest unfollowing people, using a plugin to disable suggestions (for polemic and engaging topics), and hiding ads, and Trending topics...‚Ä®‚Ä®I use Twitter as a tool since I find appealing conversations with friends and I expose my products as a creator. That said, yes, it's a 'toxic' platform by design and it's easy to use it for it's intended purpose, get engaged in useless conversations (IMO).

2022-11-01T01:45:35Z	(#kp4v2wa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I guess I need to do something useful on Go since I have only learned the basics and I didn't reach all this awesome you mentioned.‚Ä®‚Ä®Rust was too much for me at this stage, but it's the _hot language_ right now, so I always have the doubt if it's something sensible to learn next year.

2022-11-01T01:50:20Z	(#kp4v2wa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That's why I dusted off PHP 5.6 to learn the updates on 8.1 üëÄ'
2022-11-01T01:51:40Z	(#kp4v2wa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I like Python so much, but the performance is horrible for a big scale. I was betting on Nim but doesn't have all the benefits you mentioned before. I think, and a trust you, that Go could be that Python replacement.
2022-11-01T03:11:35Z	(#kp4v2wa) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> I agree! I like C# a lot, but I'd go with Script languages (Python, JS, PHP) for quick prototypes. Even working JSON with recent versions of C# takes a lot of Dev time.

2022-11-06T00:04:05Z	My thesis was on digital/electronic voting (about 10 years ago)‚Ä®‚Ä®There is an interesting problem there: How could you replace the paper ballots with a digital device? You'll find a few benefits like a fast counting and transmitting the data without moving the ballot box to a central place.‚Ä®‚Ä®The disadvantage is assuring the secrecy and freedom when you are voting. It's easy with an inert paper, extremely difficult with an electronic device. How could you be sure the vote is correct if it's secert?‚Ä®‚Ä®I found an interesting proposal (I have to read it deeply) on how to fix this problem that has been 'looking for a solution' for decades:‚Ä®https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/e2e-primer.pdf
2022-11-06T00:08:14Z	(#pd4brpq) To make it more interesting, the vote has to be anonymous and untraceable. Yes, we know who went to the election, but we shouldn't have a way to know your decision.‚Ä®‚Ä®And you must be sure that every vote was counted correctly. Interesting design problem.

2022-11-15T16:54:31Z	(#ci6uyba) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> the answer is too long for a twt, but basically the collective power is tied to the source of power.

In a cooperative model the union has shares, votes and power, in traditional models there is the collective power of the group but not deeply connected to the source. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I don't say it's not important, please do that (like in my industry of videogames full of problems) but know deeply how power works.

2022-11-19T22:03:31Z	(#dsnu5rq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> currently the bot gamifies the amount of calories to burn every week, if you do enough you climb to the next level (harder) otherwise you go down to a simpler league (greatly inspired by Duolingo)‚Ä®‚Ä®But it's only at a weekly level, I'd like to have something like "you made it greatly this year"
2022-11-19T22:13:03Z	(#dsnu5rq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> well, it's extremely simple, it asks  how many calories you burned and the timestamp is recorded automatically. That's all‚Ä®‚Ä®I get the calories from the elyptic and from some apps with routines, so perhaps the value is not very accurate but it allows to compare if you are exercising more than before. ‚Ä®‚Ä®If anyone here wants to take a look:‚Ä®https://t.me/gemu fitbot (For Telegram)

2022-11-23T19:23:06Z	(#zffutwq) @<marado https://tilde.pt/~marado/twtxt.txt> I don't agree completely with the concept of wearing out (like audio CDs vs LP or audio cassettes) degrading quality over time.‚Ä®‚Ä®But in terms of accessibility, I fully agree.

2022-11-23T19:27:46Z	(#zffutwq) and on books, I like digital books on my Kindle, mainly for novels and readings without images. Physical books for art references, books that I love, and content with many pictures. And finally PDFs for everything else, mainly disposable content.

2022-11-23T23:09:45Z	(#zffutwq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I don't disagree... It's like the difference on owning a house vs renting, and basically renting anything where you can get kicked out almost in any moment. it depends on the contract you are signing.‚Ä®‚Ä®That said, you can own DRM-free content, being hosted in a marketplace, or saved on your devices.‚Ä®‚Ä®DRM is a long topic for a twt, but as a creator I don't want my content to be pirated that much, at least not being extremely easy to pirate making the people prefer one click for a free download vs paying, let's say, 2 dollars.‚Ä®‚Ä®I don't know about the marketplaces you mentioned, only GOG and Humble Bundle for games, and some others for games. I'll take a look, that's for sharing!
2022-11-23T23:16:58Z	(#we6if3q) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> yeah, obviously monetary interests shape the products availability and regulations are useful for control those interests. (Although my anarchist friends are not that happy of fighting companies with state power, but that's another convo)‚Ä®‚Ä®Recently I watched this video on Apple not replacing Lightning with USB-C, being the main  reason licencing fees. And that only changes until EU requires it by law.‚Ä®‚Ä®I worked for a few industries putting walls on the ecosystem, by design, and I think lack of competence makes it even harder. Mainly for B2C.
2022-11-24T01:19:10Z	(#zffutwq) @<marado https://tilde.pt/~marado/twtxt.txt> Well, I can't agree on that one. It's a 'maybe' since is hard to measure, but IMO we can't say Zero evidence. There are some numbers showing that artificial scarcity has some impact on sales, and obviously, DRM devs want to sell their services, although they are biased. (I'm playing devil's advocate here, making both positions to collide to reach a useful compromise)‚Ä®‚Ä®My position is that DRM helps to prevent piracy among mainstream users, which would decide on renting Apple Music or Spotify vs using hipster alternatives. We as power users will find the best ratio between convenience and control. ‚Ä®https://www.idealog.com/blog/drm-may-not-prevent-piracy-but-it-might-still-protect-sales/‚Ä®‚Ä®I assume you've read this one: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Information_Doesn%27t_Want_to_Be_Free‚Ä®I like it as my reference on the topic.

2022-12-02T00:11:57Z	(#lwj2rdq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I disagree with your disagreement... How about that? Just joking... It's OK to disagree ‚Ä®‚Ä®I think giving an e-device is worse than allowing a teenager to create a profile on social media. Finally they are having social profiles at school and in real life, not changing neurons and the brain itself. The interesting part is that teenagers reach to be 'public' figures earlier. But again, you have to cross some boundaries like sexual content or bullying, to be really dangerous. Other than that is similar exposure that teenagers have at school, and without some platform regulating content...‚Ä®Yes, there are suicides, but not for every person, while every toddler is changing their brain and losing skills. (I need to find references here, for sure) ‚Ä®Is not black and white, both have risks. That's why I say, it's similar. Both require attention from parents, but taking e-devices away is less convenient as they take care of children.

Luckily dial up here was inexpensive and unlimited very soon, I can't recall exact details but it started with 24 or 33kbps and quickly to 56k. Sadly DSL took a few years more than in USA to be available. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Great times!
2022-12-02T00:51:51Z	(#lwj2rdq) I got to say that my computer was in a public hall from the house, so I was kind of supervised, but had chance to watch adult content (I'm not a fan), gore and some disturbing stuff for that age.

Yeah, things like 'Information wants to be free' is a colliding reality, between previous generations of owners, new creators and a public willing to find the path of least resistance.
2022-12-11T16:32:37Z	(#s5xb57q) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> that definition could be outdated, you'll have to read the licence to know what rights are you geting when you pay for something in a traditional platform or on a 'crypto contract'‚Ä®‚Ä®For instance you could copy a book on epub format, but you _shouldn't_. And you could just pirate it since is just a bunch of bytes, but maybe you want to _legally_ buy it without DRM. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Sometimes you get rights to sell your current copy, sometimes you own 'Related rights', etc. Sadly it's not a simple regulation but things like Creative Commons is a good starting point to know more about Copyright (US/UK) and author's rights (Europe, Latam)

2022-12-13T20:52:32Z	(#7iworcq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I think saying "There is no such thing as an echo chamber" is an example of the image. Are you open to a different opinion? And obviously, to different evidence?
2022-12-13T21:10:07Z	(#7iworcq) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> I've found that many disagreements start with definitions.‚Ä®What's an _echo chamber_ for each one of us? (Or any polemic topic)‚Ä®‚Ä®We are often talking about different things using the same name.
2022-12-14T00:04:28Z	(#7iworcq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Is it about 'winning'? Or is it about getting closer to the truth?
2022-12-14T00:06:57Z	Ah! Dear yarners... Today I had a chaotic day... I don't work well with artists lacking structure, planning, and such.

2022-12-14T00:19:24Z	(#7iworcq) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> Yeah. I find that definition too broad and ambiguous (Is it _only_ the same opinions? There are _no_ opposing views, at all?). And I think that leaving a subjective metric, on when it is and is not, won't help.‚Ä®‚Ä®How about?‚Ä®> An echo chamber refers to situations in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal. By participating in an echo chamber, people are able to seek out information that supports their existing views diminishing opposing views, potentially resulting in an unintended exercise of confirmation bias. ‚Ä®‚Ä®> An echo chamber is an epistemic construct in which voices are actively excluded and discredited. It does not suffer from a lack of connectivity; rather it depends on the manipulation of trust by methodically denying all outside sources.‚Ä®‚Ä®And we would need to go deeper on understanding what an epistemic construct is, but I think that's too long for a twt.

2022-12-16T16:11:22Z	I'm having a few discussions with my Latin artist friends on Stable diffusion, automation disappearing jobs, inner fears, and such.‚Ä®‚Ä®Rather than wasting time on social media, my idea is to learn, to get to a knowledge level of a 'better life' (whatever that is), or at least exercise a dialogue and perhaps a debate. Since everyone is discussing different reasons and motivations, this is a phrase I like to remind before the talk gets violent.‚Ä®‚Ä®> Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply. They're either speaking or preparing to speak. They're filtering everything through their own paradigms, reading their autobiography into other people's lives.‚Ä®‚Ä®It's exciting to spend time discussing with strangers and with friends, which has happened for ages, even before the **Internet** TM. With due moderation is a good hobby, but that's the tricky part. Not getting engaged with an ideology showing our own weaknesses disguised as knowledge and beliefs.

Some people like to stay with simpler things even if they are obsolete, incompatible, and such. They has an option to not follow an improvement and to stay with the version 1.0 of the spec, and that's OK in my book.‚Ä®‚Ä®I agree to disagree, even if I really like the extensions, let's say 1.1, not being able to communicate with people following forks or modern protocols. Their loss.

2022-12-20T01:20:23Z	(#c6yyvda) and very often it comes from people rather that tech or specs.‚Ä®‚Ä®Could be something like‚Ä®"I don't like ~prologic and/or I don't like yarn.social, I won't use that because I like things by my way"‚Ä®It's stupid, I've felt that, and now I try to ignore it a bit, it's bad for our health to listen every feedback, IMO ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2022-12-20T15:19:44Z	(#w6f7o7a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> yeah, valid and worthy points. I personally agree on most.‚Ä®‚Ä®Yarn.social at this moment is 3 things.‚Ä®1. The convenience of the software, a web site, their front-end, the 'invisible backend', an incomplete mobile app. If I'd manage the twtxt file with any other software, for me at this moment I couldn't have conversations with you. ‚Ä®2. The interoperability with older txtwt files. For instance I can read here my twtxt.txt hand made raw file to see if it works. Almost no one replies there but I know it works.‚Ä®3. The community, the stupid discussions, the learning, the meaningful experiences, Gitea. People behind a simple text file and micobrogging protocol.‚Ä®‚Ä®So yeah, as projects grow they start to be attached to _a brand_, they create organizations, institutions, knowledge bases, rituals, and intangible things we don't feel attached to. There are a few anarchist people (as in skeptical of authority and seeking to abolish institutions) not wanting to follow rules, groups and such.
2022-12-20T15:26:28Z	(#c6yyvda) @<marado https://tilde.pt/~marado/twtxt.txt> well, I find that's a problem of leaving that open. Using should vs must.

2022-12-21T12:26:16Z	(#okoq7yq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> as an university professor, I've found that classrooms are the worst place to learn to code, program or dev.‚Ä®‚Ä®There is not enough time to personalize teaching, from the current knowledge every student has, up to the semester goals (usually standardized). People is stressed on learning a lot in a few months, throwing up everything into the exam, so usually that isn't meaningful and internalized learning which programing requires in the long term. ‚Ä®‚Ä®What has worked for me was to record short videos with step by step explanations, so the students can watch and rewind at their pace, and then we have office hours to explain anything the student didn't get.‚Ä®‚Ä®Something like:‚Ä®1. Watch how I do it‚Ä®2. Try to repeat that‚Ä®3. Try to do something different alone‚Ä®4. You are by yourself now!
2022-12-21T12:31:09Z	(#okoq7yq) I've also found that, at least here, Computer Science or (Management of) Information Tecnologies are not related to creating or architecturing software, but on understanding and maintaining current ones.‚Ä®‚Ä®Which is not that bad, you cannot create something if you don't know previous solutions or implementations... ü§î‚Ä®Again, there is simply not enough time in 3-5 years of intense education to learn to 'program'

Learning from 0 to, let's say, 50% takes a year. 50-75% another year, and so. The last 95-99% takes decades of intense and purposeful practice.

2022-12-27T13:53:42Z	(#okoq7yq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> yeah, the compromise between the  essentials, or the foundation to build knowledge on top of it, is tricky.‚Ä®‚Ä®And I also agree on teaching to do something realistic.‚Ä®Currently I'm designing a course from scratch for C# and I'm constantly saying "don't validate this yet", don't preoptimize this now...

2022-12-27T13:57:51Z	(#okoq7yq) It reminds me when I was learning piano.

I think I had the Apache stats, then WordPress and such, but I wasn't excited by stats dashboards TBH.‚Ä®Now I think visits are vanity metrics, even for commercial sites, so I rely more on interactions, emails received, replies, and such.‚Ä®‚Ä®On https://text.eapl.mx I have nothing. No comments section, and no analytics whatsoever. I received a message every 1-2 months, and I think I had a few replies on Gemini (it's difficult to track, and I forgot to add the link in the article)‚Ä®‚Ä®In my 'personal' podcast I have no stats, it's a handmade Atom file.‚Ä®For the remaining podcasts hosted on YouTube and Anchor, I have from 20 plays/views up to 9k for some specific topics (mostly design ones disguised as rants). And I think 120 subscribers.

2023-01-02T16:01:25Z	(#trmql3q) Since the popularization of browsers with tabs in 1999, that has been a problem for intelectual people, I think. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm trying to live a digital minimalism (whatever that means, I've had long conversations about the definition), and having at most 5 tabs open has been challenging to me, but I try. ‚Ä®I'm looking forward to a soft limit of, let's say, 7-10 tabs. If you get your screen full, you should receive a warning... More than 15-25 would be simply not allowed. It's against the interest of browsers designers (use it more), but I think there should be some extension for it. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Now I have those endless text files with hundreds of links, more like a black hole than a Reading list.  I say also, the habit of cleaning your lists is as good as making it bigger. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Other useful habits are, trying to write more than reading, avoid looking for new links until you read or delete previous ones, and not subscribing to a new mailing list until I unsuscribe another. It has been a similar pain than to buy new clothes.
2023-01-02T16:06:22Z	(#icr3cwq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> that's the answer. Now I try to close as many as I open, ha...‚Ä®‚Ä®I think I moved to the extreme of "compulsive cleaning", but, hey, it works...
2023-01-02T16:52:18Z	(#trmql3q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> that's a great idea. A friend of mine made an extension that killed random tabs, but I don't recall the exact details.‚Ä®I think killing the older tabs could be good enough, or randomly between tabs older than X days. Perhaps with the last 10 tabs, you would notice. IDK‚Ä®‚Ä®What browser do you use? (Over here, Edge, Firefox, and Kiwi)
2023-01-03T11:56:56Z	For some reason I couldn't sleep tonight (I think that strong coffee ‚òï at dinner was a bad idea)‚Ä®‚Ä®Anyway, it was a nice opportunity to settle my ideas for this year. After a few days of vacations, I could define more easily what to aim for, what to work for. My references are the Maslow's hierarchy of needs and [Hierarchy of Hapiness](https://www.sloww.co/happiness-ebook/) as insights on things I might be overlooking. Like social relationships, relationship with money, belongings, impact with creativity, altruism, a learning path and so on.‚Ä®My main realization (perhaps obvious but what can I say...) is that statistically I have about 30 years more of productive life. There is no rush, but at the same time I need those challenges to live a tasty present.‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm grateful that this has been a pretty decent life, which is transforming into something new (damn mid-30s crisis). As they say, the best things are yet to come. Or at least, new challenges to overcome. And that's the tasty part of life.
2023-01-03T17:29:02Z	(#nxocirq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> in a personal case, in 2022 I explored client certificates, (I can't recall who suggested that, it was you?). ‚Ä®‚Ä®I think it's amazing for corporates and perhaps power users. Anyway, I think it's too obscure for a normal employee who doesn't understand what's going on. ‚Ä®‚Ä®For something closer to the current Web experience I think Webauthn/Passkeys will be slightly simpler to use and to implement, due to the support of main OS and integrated security hardware in PCs and Phones. Or you can use a USB device which is closer to a "car key" being the physical aspect easier to understand than an abstract encryption technology IMO. ‚Ä®‚Ä®But as they say, why not both?

So, I don't know what to think. I've been reading that book _Bad blood_, and basically is, until a huge fraud happens, the law gets updated to prevent another case, and it's a never ending story...

2023-01-07T21:02:06Z	(#u46vmva) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I agree with that part, lying is wrong, although people like to live some lies, but that's another conversation. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I don't agree that automating a help line is completely wrong per se... We'll need to define lines on, at this right moment of humanity, what's "right, true, and such" ‚Ä®‚Ä®Something I don't agree with is polarization of "everything about this subject is wrong" "everything is amazing". ‚Ä®‚Ä®It's good to be opinionated, I respect different ideas (right or wrong).

2023-01-07T21:06:05Z	Reading that book about the Telegraph made me thing A LOT on the history of technology. Another book about history of power made me think on our short lifetime of, let's say 50 productive years, how much we can impact in society from what we currently are, to the future of society in 100 years.‚Ä®‚Ä®Action and thinking... Progress, quality of life, a better world for our families, resources. Transcendence. These are things that have moved a lot of people for the last centuries.‚Ä®‚Ä®I think the current life speed is faster than it should, but I guess that depends on our reference point.
2023-01-08T02:25:25Z	I was listening to a conversation about "fake it until you make it", based on the Theranos case. It's in Spanish, so it wouldn't be useful to be shared here, but the topic made think. ‚Ä®‚Ä®The idea topic is, don't lie. It's unsustainable. Avoid distorsion fields and "validation circles" when you trust what someone else trusted. Yeah, we have to manage the truth, and we have to know when someone is lying to us (pretty hard in some circles). It's not as easy as "never lie", so many due diligence on our beliefs is needed, even with risk of discovering the truth.
2023-01-08T02:27:37Z	But I think I'm too deep into controversial topics.‚Ä®I guess I'll switch to more mundane topics for a while.‚Ä®‚Ä®I watched Willow, a fun movie from the 80s. And finished recording a class about DRM and Piracy... Interesting Saturday here. How is going yours?

With Apps/Software/Services that are continuously improving, it could be acceptable IMO. My main issue is when you keep paying for a "finished product". It's more complicated if it has ads, it's freemium, uses servers, and so on.‚Ä®On the production side, well, they do it because they can (although we don't like that they can, it seems). Development costs are continuously increasing, so it's an endless rush to spend more to compete, subsidize costs somehow, then earn more, rinse and repeat.‚Ä®I've seen successes of 5-10% on indie developers, but I'd like to know the numbers for huge companies.

How could we compare current software to that made under different conditions? ‚Ä®That said, I name an interesting case. Videogames and movies. The price is almost the same, 40-60 USD for a AAA game, or 10 USD for a Hollywood ticket. And I think it hasn't raised due to inflation, but budgets are increasing, technical features and quality is debatable improving.

2023-01-16T16:41:09Z	(#ny75ulq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> First day of the week are Sundays, so the first 'calendar' week started on January 1st, 2023. That's problematic for using ISO weeks, but it works for this project. Start of the week is at Sunday-Monday midnight which is about Sun 6pm here. You register your exercise from Sun to Sun. ‚Ä®‚Ä®For this project on Python I used that `isocalendar` module from `datetime` lib.‚Ä®‚Ä®The bad implementation was on using something like‚Ä®```‚Ä®next_week = current_week + 1‚Ä®```‚Ä®which was not valid when the year changed, worked for all 2022 except the last week, ha!

2023-01-21T14:38:40Z	(#lnbbpzq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> interesting. I'll take a look. With BitWarden I don't need to do that, and it cleans the clipboard after a few secs, but I understand you use case. I'm looking for alternatives to BitWarden, but as we've discussed, there are many differences to take into consideration. ‚Ä®‚Ä®On watching passwords in plain text I mean typing passwords on some strange devices like TV sets, public or family computers (risky!), Xbox, Switch.

I co-founded a video game studio which for funding and pandemic reasons turned into crypto gaming, since there was "money" in that field. I received a lot of criticism fro colleagues, but some support from friends.‚Ä®A few friends were making decent money working on crypto games, for huge companies with big investment behind.‚Ä®‚Ä®But for me... Most of the environment felt like "get rich quick squeme". Even my partner (biz dev) felt really deep into that way of life. I slowly got away, sad by the risk I've taken. Not repentant, just sad of how money makes us think of our promises. ‚Ä®‚Ä®What can I say? Not every buzzword is bad by itself, but my logic brain is against promising more and delivering less (playing with the truth, in my book). Like with electric cars, social networking connecting the world and exploiting Asian workers to have a decent phone at a subsidized price.

2023-01-22T15:13:10Z	(#dlbntsa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I'd disagree. The world is huge. We are 8 billion people, as individuals we can impact 100, perhaps 1,000 people. Even the biggest companies impact billions, but not all humanity. Even countries and global leaders impact a slice of the world. It's a huge problem for us to solve. It's nice tring to break limits. In my youth, for that sake I joined into politics, companies, and non-profits. And it's hard and a bit disappointing that things doesn't improve in the way we'd expect.
