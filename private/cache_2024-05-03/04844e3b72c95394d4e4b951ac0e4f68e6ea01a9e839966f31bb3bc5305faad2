2021-10-09T00:31:46+11:00	Hello world! üòÅ
2021-10-09T19:03:51+11:00	(#5y7vdha) @<lobste_rs https://feeds.twtxt.net/lobste_rs/twtxt.txt> At least, it doesn't seem to be another Chrome/Chromium clone!
2021-10-09T20:00:00+11:00	(#xzy5xwq) @<lobste_rs https://feeds.twtxt.net/lobste_rs/twtxt.txt> Now that's interesting. Without reading the header properly, I assumed it was regular old CDE... but nope, it's a modern take on it!
2021-10-09T22:56:02+11:00	[Trying Librewolf](https://we.loveprivacy.club/blog/eldersnake/2021/10/09/trying-librewolf)
2021-10-11T08:51:06+11:00	(#jgi4ypa) I like it! Less work to refactor, I'm sure, and also Just Works. As you say, a prompt or something at least is probably all that is needed.
2021-10-11T09:41:32+11:00	(#fazklya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Posting üòÉ
2021-10-11T13:04:07+11:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#fsy7aja) ‚Ä®‚Ä®> Yup fucking Apple‚Ñ¢ and their shitty Safari browser. üò° Why does Apple have to keep breaking their own software so badly?! üò± ‚Äì Especially user facing software and user experience! geez louise Apple, get a grip! Hire better engineers or fire the lousy product managers you have. Apple the company is broken üò¢‚Ä®‚Ä®Maybe they'll need to migrate it to a Chromium base ü§£ (kidding)
2021-10-11T13:14:14+11:00	(#fsy7aja) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>‚Ä®‚Ä®> Oh nice! üëå I wish we lived on a nice 90acre property üòÜ /cc @kt84 ‚Ä®‚Ä®Granted, my internet infrastructure is a _tad_ limited...‚Ä®‚Ä®My article on my solar setup gave some insight into that.
2021-10-12T20:41:06+11:00	(#mizqj4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ah, I don't always see that come up but just gotta hit the "Let Me Read First" button.
2021-10-13T12:59:09+11:00	(#5trsxtq) @<slashdot https://feeds.twtxt.net/slashdot/twtxt.txt> What a shock üôÑ
2021-10-15T20:21:41+11:00	Little ashamed to say I only just a few days ago realised that https://feeds.twtxt.net/ was a thing and could be used to make a feed from RSS. With that I was able to make a feed for https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/ . Very cool and handy.
2021-10-15T20:37:06+11:00	(#ewj63aq) I've been to the Feeds page quite a few times, for someone who is not _actually_ legally blind, I sure missed it easily enough ü§£ ‚Ä®I think it's reasonably well laid out too, but admittedly page design is not my forte either. cc @laz @<quark https://ferengi.one/twtxt.txt> and anyone else who's been tinkering with designs I guess?
2021-10-15T20:50:42+11:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#dd3vxja) Sounds like an awesome day and a good way to see a colleague off. Love the Simpsons theme too!
2021-10-15T23:50:32+11:00	(#dd3vxja) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> I would but admittedly I have a rather awful social anxiety with calls and/or video chat. Yet I'm fine in person. Which probably sounds rather backwards I know üôÅ
2021-10-16T12:31:35+11:00	(#66uo3sa) Yep updated both my Pods, handy addition. I use to just follow the hashtags back to the original convo but this Root button should be much more intuitive to people.
2021-10-16T12:33:43+11:00	(#66uo3sa) The only thing I'd add, is does the button need to show if the there isn't a root conversation to go back to? Like this current conversation obviously hasn't been forked yet, so the button just essentially reloads the page. If it's easy enough to add in context to the code to hide it maybe when it's an unforked convo? ü§î
2021-10-17T10:32:46+11:00	(#jfnzaca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> 5? (cheating a little bit üòõ)
2021-10-17T20:21:10+11:00	![](https://we.loveprivacy.club/media/DogkFpNwk6tEhmonG64UhG.mp4) ‚Ä®‚Ä®Testing video upload (some guy doing a backflip)
2021-10-17T20:41:16+11:00	(#xbglreq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Wait what? Your pod as well? Video works on both my pods ü§î Just not Goryon. EDIT: nevermind, I misread haha.
2021-10-23T23:53:59+11:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> woops, had a short outage as the weather has been atrocious and voltage dropped a bit too low. Swapped in a another battery for the night, but the Raspberry Pi had already gone down and obviously something wasn't fully finished writing in `yarnd` cos, well this upon attempted restart of my pod -‚Ä®`time="2021-10-23T23:47:14+11:00" level=error msg="error creating store" error="unexpected end of JSON input"`
2021-10-23T23:54:28+11:00	(#omlqnva) I'm also a _tinsy_ bit tipsy and probably not thinking well ü§£‚Ä®I deleted the cache in `./data` already but to no avail.
2021-10-23T23:57:56+11:00	(#omlqnva) On the plus side... I can see the custom 404 works well!
2021-10-24T21:02:40+11:00	Test comment
2021-10-28T09:36:47+11:00	(#4s2q3zq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> LOL ü§£
2021-11-06T22:49:48+11:00	(#lebb7wa) Yep, that was the problem ü§£ üòµ
2021-11-08T16:25:36+11:00	Test comment that I'll edit. ‚Ä®Editing...
2021-11-08T16:26:36+11:00	Another test comment to edit. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Editing...
2021-11-08T16:55:24+11:00	(#6vglpfa) The only weird thing is this comment that I made at about 4:54ish AEDT, is shown as posted 4.26PM AEDT ü§î ‚Ä®Edit: This comment is however timestamped fine, so maybe a momentary weirdness on my server/pod..
2021-11-11T10:48:46+11:00	(#mazwihq) The fourth person lives under a rock üòÅ
2021-12-24T10:21:43+11:00	(#r6zunpa) Can confirm on my personal pod (the auto generated avatar for @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>) , but it's not happening on this Pod (We.LovePrivacy.Club). Although this pod is still running 0.9.0@db07211 so may have something to do with it? ü§î
2021-12-25T08:09:44+11:00	(#sd32u4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Merry Christmas mate üòä
2022-01-06T20:20:50+11:00	PSA: my personal pod (yarn.andrewjvpowell.com) will be offline overnight as I've powered off the RPi. Had a couple bad days in terms of weather and the solar voltage is getting a bit on the low side (and I can't be bothered going out and swapping in another battery üôÉ).
2022-01-06T20:48:39+11:00	(#ithbxba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yup exactly üòä

2022-01-07T10:55:16+11:00	(#ddxvhoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Very skeptical, for sure.
2022-01-07T22:52:42+11:00	(#6ruzanq) Works üëå‚Ä® ![](https://we.loveprivacy.club/media/PneLx9eEM8cpn7kVzdSikQ) ‚Ä®‚Ä®Wondering if the 'twtxt' bot should be called something else though? ü§î

2022-01-27T11:52:15+11:00	My yarn.andrewjvpowell.com Pod will be out for a bit, couple of rather cloudy days so letting the battery recover today üòä
2022-01-27T17:20:33+11:00	(#uyznr6a) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I've had a really good run, going weeks at a time without even having to think about it, but if I happen to get a few cloudy days in succession it can be a bit dicey sometimes! My battery isn't actually in the greatest health and will need to be replaced at some point, but it's fine for now.‚Ä®‚Ä®@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> How do you mean? ü§î
2022-01-28T21:06:04+11:00	@<serzrkv https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/serzrkv/twtxt.txt> Hi, welcome to my pod! ü•≥
2022-01-29T15:59:55+11:00	@<levprw https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/levprw/twtxt.txt> Hi üòä Welcome to my pod!
2022-05-19T01:55:17+10:00	Welp, the SD card must be corruption-happy on my RPi, the below quoted Yarn doesn't even show on that pod anymore üòÖ‚Ä®‚Ä®> Might be a bit before I can update this Pod, not because of any issue with yarnd, but because, I think, my SD card must be dying in the RPi üôÉ‚Ä®> Getting lots of file corruption errors, the thing can‚Äôt even download update archives from apt without them becoming corrupted or incomplete lol.
2022-06-05T13:49:10+10:00	(#h36l74q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> See you on the other side üòÅ
2022-07-04T12:16:29+10:00	Still alive, just a lot going on. Until I fix my RPi, using this Pod as my primary. ;)
2022-07-05T13:15:35+10:00	(#6e5zxdq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> hey mate, I'm okay. Just been busy with work and personal life (and keeping warm lol). I haven't been up to much in cyberspace TBH. But I see Yarn.social keeps getting some nice little touches every time I come on and actually do a `yarnd` update. How's the community kicking along? Haven't seen @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> in the latest feeds unless he's going by another name so guessing he's moved onto other ventures.
2022-11-19T19:52:44+11:00	Still alive, just navigating life and relationship stuff.‚Ä®‚Ä®Also just got Starlink, so my internet is at least vastly improved. Yes I know, making Elon richer...
2022-11-19T20:04:36+11:00	(#bbrkvqa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thanks man, it's all good. Feel a bit guilty I've let my Pods slip in terms of updating. How likely are they to explode if I run a Git pull and rebuild? üòÖ
2022-11-25T13:08:35+11:00	(#zrbvphq) Pretty sure this is how you get Skynet
2023-01-23T14:16:13+11:00	(#dlbntsa) Yeah, AI this, AI that, it's almost smothering anywhere you go in the tech news world.‚Ä®‚Ä®It's going to be like the internet in general - has a heap of hype and dreams about how it will make life easier/better in various ways... and then get used and abused by Big Tech to invade our privacy and make society worse.
2023-01-23T17:38:06+11:00	(#oolaz7q) @justamoment  I find sometimes I have to open up whatever is guarded by reCaptcha in a barebones Chromium instance. I normally use the Brave browser but I think all the privacy guarding stuff trips up the captcha. I have a lot more luck with captcha solving in stock Chromium.‚Ä®‚Ä®That said, reCaptcha is the absolute devil!
2023-01-23T20:57:39+11:00	(#uru3v2a) Well to be honest I don't know why it went down ü§£ I mean sure, watching (and using) it more often would help, but the process just died, the server itself has been up the whole time.
2023-01-23T23:38:27+11:00	(#uru3v2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ahh well admittedly no (that would be too helpful!). I've just always `nohup`'d it manually. So responsible I know :p
2023-01-23T23:40:11+11:00	(#uru3v2a) But yeah now you bring it up I really *should* get it running under a supervisor.
2023-01-24T07:35:19+11:00	(#uru3v2a) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt>  @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> fantastic, thanks guys!
2023-01-24T07:38:07+11:00	(#fh2laiq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>  nice! I'd be pretty chuffed with that result.
2023-01-24T07:40:33+11:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> is the Goryon client still in development? I'm using the latest Android apk from your git repo, works fine except it wont open URLs for some reason.
2023-01-24T10:33:12+11:00	(#rcurinq) thought I was following @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> , but apparently not. Fixed üòÖ
2023-01-24T11:05:44+11:00	(#gaapgna) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt>  huh, I've never heard of that ü§£
2023-01-25T07:53:15+11:00	(#qqhgbdq) excellent üëå
2023-01-26T16:19:29+11:00	(#262bora) You know you've made it once the spam bots start moving in üòÖ
2023-01-26T17:52:14+11:00	Okay so I have no clue about Rust nor am I a very proficient programmer, but surely this is even more of a joke than[ this repo](https://github.com/mTvare6/hello-world.rs) portrays it to be? It can't actually be this ridiculous to make a `hello world` in Rust surely  üòÖ
2023-01-26T20:03:32+11:00	(#4jsfxfa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> LOL, well that is *much* more reasonable üòÑ‚Ä®‚Ä®But yeah @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, I am finally just starting to learn Go actually. It's surprised me, from what I've seen, how simple some things can be on the web development side. For example something like the Gin web framework ([example](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/examples/html-rendering/)), things are happening in less boilerplate than often what I've seen in PHP frameworks etc which I didn't expect.
2023-01-28T08:50:40+11:00	(#2rdzq6q) ffs Putin, give it up ü§¶

2023-01-28T21:16:46+11:00	(#qcg3nuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  oh yeah they are surprisingly comfy
2023-01-28T23:13:12+11:00	(#v4bk7oa) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> Bet there's some interesting psychology at play there
2023-01-29T01:28:51+11:00	(#xwc6jeq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yeah *hopefully*, though as @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> says, seems almost inevitable these days. :/
2023-01-30T21:36:49+11:00	(#dhhickq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what do you dislike about SQL, just out of curiosity? Just personal preference or more architectural reason?
2023-01-31T08:17:50+11:00	Holy shit Goroutines are awesome
2023-01-31T14:11:08+11:00	(#x7b3vsa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>  is that like some sort of pagination?
2023-01-31T14:21:18+11:00	(#c3pmcpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  not me mate, I asked as I was genuinely curious and as someone who only really knows SQL as far as databases go, I keep wondering what life is like on the NoSQL side of the fence üòÖ

2023-02-05T08:03:05+11:00	It's easy to forget during my hiatuses how well yarn works for a news feed. Its nice browsing my timeline and getting news bits and pieces without any algorithm or corporation pushing it at me.
2023-02-05T08:21:32+11:00	(#o4stj3a) I mean, this was always going to be a problem
2023-02-05T12:04:03+11:00	(#kthy2ya) Isn't the beauty of this whole yarn thing that you can just mute or just not follow someone? Then you'll never see stuff you don't want to.‚Ä®‚Ä®I too am against over moderating, and it can be a slippery slope. On many other platforms I can see why it might be needed because of the way that stuff automatically propagates and is so discoverable or even pushed by an algorithm, but on a place like here... So easy to just tune out.

No, we need to move our attention back to the folks that have been right all along. The people who never gave up on semantic markup, CSS, and progressive enhancement for most sites. The people who, when slinging JS, have treated it as special occasion food. The tools and communities whose culture puts the user ahead of the developer and hold evidence of doing better for users in the highest regard.
2023-02-08T22:17:44+11:00	(#6kofqia) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yep, here's another good one from the same guy: https://infrequently.org/2022/12/performance-baseline-2023/‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®>To serve users at the 75th percentile (P75) of devices and networks, we can now afford ~150KiB of HTML/CSS/fonts and ~300-350KiB of JavaScript (gzipped). This is a slight improvement on last year's budgets, thanks to device and network improvements. Meanwhile, sites continue to send more script than is reasonable for 80+% of the world's users, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. This is an ethical crisis for frontend.

So if I have a server and client (both written in Go), data is passed as JSON and marshalled/unmarshalled in both cases to structs that are basically identical between the programs, and I want to have these structs 'shared', should I put the structs maybe into a single file as it's own package and just pull them into the server/client that way?

There's still a real purity to what we have here with Yarn/twtxt, so while I'm sure integration of some sort is useful for people, I guess it should be as least impactful on the current system as possible. An adapter or service does sound better rather than yarnd talking directly to it all, if I understand that part of the conversation correctly. I know very little of ActivityPub admittedly though.

2023-05-06T15:11:51+10:00	(#h7gltfa) Jordan Peterson isn't all bad. He can be eccentric and makes some odd comparisons and arguments, but one needs to take the good  bits like the personal responsibility etc and filter out the rest. A problem with people today seems to be they can't totally think for themselves and approach things like it's all or nothing.‚Ä®One of my favourite philosophers is Friedrich Nietzsche and I always liked how Peterson spoke of his works generally, but sometimes he had some interpretations I didn't like so much, but I could tell that was JP's conservative Christian bias coming through. It is what it is and I just keep it in mind when dwelling on his point of view.
2023-05-06T15:15:53+10:00	(#h7gltfa) Same with Ben Shapiro, I don't always agree with either of them on some things. Both can go a little too far the other way when it comes to LGBTQ+ stuff for my liking, but then there's plenty of stuff I would agree with them on, such as the problem of trans women (biologically born men) in pro women's sports or surgeries on kids. But I'm much more supportive and inclusive with trans people in a general sense than either of those two.  Sadly on most platforms, even what I'm saying here would be something people would absolutely jump on and attack. It's a bit sad really.
2023-05-06T15:19:14+10:00	(#h7gltfa) But @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I hope you don't give up re: yarn.

It's plagued with scam ads, nsfw ads (ironic given how YT insists the content creators have to keep things clean to satisfy the ad payers) and even ads that'll lead to actual malware, if not spyware.‚Ä®‚Ä®YouTube, if you can't even moderate your ad network properly, let alone the fact that at the very least they are WAY too frequent/obnoxious, you cannot insist on people disabling their adblocker
2023-11-22T07:44:18+11:00	(#la3jy6a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Apparently it's not necessarily targeted at Firefox per se, as the delayed loading thing has happened on Chromium-based browsers too, but more YouTube targeting those running an adblocker. The only part about that I don't quite get is why just spoofing a Chrome user agent often fixes it.
2023-11-23T20:07:50+11:00	Bahaha, hilarious but also probably the future üòµ‚Ä®‚Ä®[https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/181mpvw/hold_it_in_for_youtube_ads/](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/181mpvw/hold_it_in_for_youtube_ads/)
2023-12-06T08:30:59+11:00	(#skvcmlq) That is pretty hilarious ü§£
2023-12-13T14:46:40+11:00	When it's a hot day and you realize your Raspberry Pi 4B is running at nearly 80c (it has a case but no fan or heatsinks) and you CBF waiting for one to arrive.‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://we.loveprivacy.club/media/KTaAGuufsjpuNongwoJQRJ.png) ‚Ä®‚Ä®Works a treat üòÖ Just grabbed an unused PC fan, adapted it to an old 5v phone wall charger and hey presto, instantly cooler by 25c+.
2023-12-13T14:54:32+11:00	(#yn65ena) So it begins.
2023-12-13T15:18:40+11:00	(#wg2yjtq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> bahaha ü§£ yeah I use cable ties maybe.. A lot.

2023-12-23T12:05:48+11:00	(#g4fluea) Would help if Microshaft didn't force the TPM/Secure Boot requirement. I bypassed that requirement using a registry tool and was able to upgrade one of my "incompatible" machines to Windows 11 just fine.‚Ä®‚Ä®But yes, in any case there's always Linux. My Thinkpad X200 from 2008 still flies along with Arch Linux and  a lightweight DE.
2023-12-23T12:07:41+11:00	(#yzlmaeq) @<slashdot https://feeds.twtxt.net/slashdot/twtxt.txt> bahahaha wat
2023-12-28T22:35:33+11:00	(#z33bzjq) @<slashdot https://feeds.twtxt.net/slashdot/twtxt.txt> WTF did I read ü§£
2024-01-20T13:02:22+11:00	(#i5bkolq) I'm glad I switched to Jellyfin for my home library a while ago. They say "buy" movies but like most services, it'll most likely "buy" a subscription to access said movie, that can be revoked any time. Unless you could buy a movie and have the file on your hard drive DRM-free, but that will never happen with the movie studios involved.
2024-01-20T19:05:29+11:00	(#i5bkolq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  exactly! Plus they get pirated anyway even with every restriction they apply, so they're just inconveniencing all of us including those of us who would pay money.
2024-01-21T19:38:39+11:00	(#hgwe26q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> At least Cat 6 though surely?
2024-01-23T13:38:53+11:00	(#fucv4ya) Thank you for this!
2024-02-05T08:39:41+11:00	(#53hisvq) Somehow, I am not surprised. Like the cigarette industry all over again.
2024-02-07T08:45:48+11:00	(#pn753ea) It really does need viable competition. It's a difficult one though, because it has by virtue of it being of the best early video sites in town and subsequent popularity, an absolute treasure trove of content, as bender says. But all owned by now what is a jackass company that loves being a monopoly.‚Ä®‚Ä®Sadly the only way it changes is the people that post content on there move it all to other viable places, old and new, like mass migration. I don't see how that happens, especially when content creators don't want to lose the ad-revenue. But hopefully something gives eventually.
2024-02-07T15:57:49+11:00	(#5ww6svq) Jeebus! I can only dream üòÜ
2024-02-07T18:59:02+11:00	(#5ww6svq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> You're set! Especially being you're a self-hoster in as much as you can, I assume the old connection was a bottle neck sometimes?
2024-02-07T19:50:37+11:00	(#5ww6svq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ick, that's even worse.
2024-02-08T09:59:24+11:00	(#ykgbhoq) Why tho...
2024-02-08T23:23:31+11:00	(#j27idwa) Pretty cool!
2024-02-13T08:31:36+11:00	(#ela6ddq) 50mb to now 700mb... I dunno, I know the numbers would have to inflate quite a bit since the days of 2006 etc but for a distro with that ethos I would have thought maybe 300-400mb would be more in line with what it wants to be.
2024-02-13T18:46:19+11:00	(#ela6ddq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Bloody hell, things really have blown up
2024-02-25T09:00:13+11:00	(#b6p3bya) @<slashdot https://feeds.twtxt.net/slashdot/twtxt.txt> just what the dating app world needs, more robots...

2024-03-12T17:39:03+11:00	(#77ekfka) So a way to opt out of the algorithm? What is the negative I'm missing here? üòÖ
2024-03-13T15:47:52+11:00	(#77ekfka) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Huh that's interesting, is there any more details to this?
