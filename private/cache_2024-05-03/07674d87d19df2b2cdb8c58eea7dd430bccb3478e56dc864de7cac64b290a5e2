2022-12-01T01:49:24Z	(#rgv7q3a) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> you should get the time zone automatically. The next screen is royally, and utterly, confusing. My two pence.
2022-12-01T01:55:38Z	(#v55m6bq) @<prologic https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> you wrote _“discussing ideas openly and transparently on their merits should not get you banned”_. That **is not** what is happening. It is baseless misinformation with the intent to harm, confuse, and create chaos. It is subversion. It is ignoramus behaviour.
2022-12-01T02:12:43Z	The slight horizontal scrolling whilst on mobile is pretty annoying.
2022-12-01T02:22:58Z	(#tbewtta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> football, yes. The US beat Iran 1-0, eliminating them, and staying in the run.
2022-12-01T14:43:26Z	(#v55m6bq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and people, just people spreading things they believe to be right, but aren't. "Brainwashed" people. Idiots, and the like. People with their own backward, erroneous, beliefs (white race is superior, jewish genocide didn't happen, and the like). Moderation (and yes, that includes banning), and what Twitter is disassembling now, is required.
2022-12-01T15:54:29Z	(#v55m6bq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> good, and comprehensive reply, thank you!  > I don’t know what the answer is, but we can’t be naive and think that just by “debating” we are going to stop people from spreading bad ideas.  Indeed! It comes to mind the popular saying, "How do you deal with nazis? — You punch them in the face."
2022-12-01T18:30:46Z	(#v55m6bq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt>, you wrote *"I still believe that debating is the most peaceful way to deal with disagreement"*. At which point do you stop debating? If you were debating with Nazi Germany, at which point you stop, and take action? Don't be naïve. You can't reason—and, thus, nor debate—with most people believing, and spreading, misinformation. As @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> wrote, I don't know the answer. Now endlessly "debating", and otherwise doing nothing, ain't.
2022-12-01T20:47:58Z	(#x7oliha) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> yes, it is.  While on your site, the banner that top about some blog, is covering the site logo, and controls (login, etc.), on mobile.
2022-12-01T20:59:25Z	(#zf2p6fq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> "the National Review is an American conservative editorial magazine, focusing on news and commentary pieces on political, social, and cultural affairs." — Going to leave this here, without further comments.
2022-12-01T21:34:25Z	(#zf2p6fq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt>   > Why have not told the truth since the beginning ??  Because the truth wasn't known.
2022-12-02T00:22:19Z	(#l35uzvq) > (by the way Jesus is born end of September beginning of October)  Jesus was never born. It is a myth.
2022-12-02T03:03:25Z	(#z5tu5sa) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> does he runs on dirt? If not, and runs on cemented/tiled floor, he needs some nail trimming pronto! 😬  Cute, though. 🥰
2022-12-02T19:29:46Z	(#phd6wba) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> center the label, and leave “2 new posts ♻️” (of course, different icon).
2022-12-04T14:10:03Z	(#tz55aqa) Did you buy credits? Remember you get limited ones for free.
2022-12-04T22:24:13Z	(#n4ozcya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> did something break? 😅
2022-12-04T22:27:12Z	I have been mentioned before, in more than one occasion, yet:  ![Zero mentions](https://twtxt.net/media/d7WDgfFxPojXuXS5ymVhtL.png)
2022-12-04T22:41:18Z	(#phd6wba) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> I don’t see a reason for the “click here”. Specially when more and more people are in mobile today (tapping, not clicking). Instinctively people will click, or tap. Perhaps replacing “Click here to refresh” with “Refresh now” would be a better UX.
2022-12-05T15:02:46Z	(#5k77faq) I see you are, so far, failing. 😂
2022-12-05T15:07:03Z	(#qhipmmq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> .emit eht lla siht ekil etirw ot desu icniVaD odranoeL ,seY
2022-12-05T22:03:32Z	(#cwde46q) @iolfree she never did. She simply crossposted from Mastodon, or elsewhere. Never, ever, participated on a twt conversation.
2022-12-05T22:24:25Z	(#fg6xlkq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> they do have access to the web server logs.
2022-12-05T23:39:45Z	(#65sar6q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> who is the one having problems? 😂
2022-12-05T23:41:00Z	(#o645kaq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thank you. Let’s see how it goes. I am just trying to make the other issue come afloat.
2022-12-06T15:09:07Z	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> wishing you a quick, and permanent, recovery! 🙏🏻❤️🌹
2022-12-06T16:03:48Z	(#fg6xlkq) And—for all we know—it was the OP first, and last post. Yet, here we are. 🤣
2022-12-06T16:31:49Z	(#fg6xlkq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> but why? What about "This is my first, rather experimental, post." is so enticing, that "quite a few folks" have to immediately follow feeds? 🤯
2022-12-06T16:53:07Z	@<apptester https://twtxt.net/user/apptester/twtxt.txt> OK. Lets see if I can prove something with this.
2022-12-06T20:05:18Z	(#fwjfieq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>  > I don’t want to see AI-generated text anymore, that ship has sailed.  Oh boy, you are in for a rude awakening! This is just getting started. 😬
2022-12-07T00:43:15Z	(#zn5ej3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> oh boy, yes. Anyway, yup. Right. 😂
2022-12-07T19:39:03Z	(#cpwvyxq) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> mkws.in (and others) is available for $12.
2022-12-07T20:19:39Z	(#cpwvyxq) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I know, I am pointing out you can get a cheaper domain!
2022-12-07T21:37:50Z	(#cpwvyxq) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> if you have monies, of course!
2022-12-08T14:44:51Z	(#chrwmaq) @<me https://eapl.mx/twtxt.txt> you are lucky you can get off easy with just "give me $10"! In the US $10 does nothing. You need to give, at least, $50. 😂
2022-12-10T01:14:24Z	(#23g67pq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what are you referring to? Context, like content, is king. 😊
2022-12-10T14:52:27Z	(#verezuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> the solution, of course, is to have many servers, each with less users. Anything that grows too big is bound to either have problems, or become too expensive to maintain, or both. So, servers need to be architected to be light weight, and relatively simple to operate.
2022-12-10T16:57:43Z	(#verezuq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> right, how Mastodon does it, because how it is architected, is problematic. I don’t think ActivityPub was meant, and made, to scale to the thousand/millions of followers either.
2022-12-10T18:34:15Z	(#aybkk4q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> not torture! That's the Australian way to toughen children spirit, and encourage strength of mind. 😂 I, for one, welcome our Australian overlords (and overladies)!
2022-12-11T18:45:10Z	(#kdyv56q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> most gift children want here are hard to find. So, the earlier you hunt for them, the better chances you have to find them. That, and the thought of “let’s get it over with”, makes people buy them earlier. 😂
2022-12-15T01:58:19Z	(#lzhpceq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> that's utterly, and absolutely, and irremediably bonkers. And **I love it**!
2022-12-16T12:46:40Z	(#xe67zvq) @<saltyim https://twtxt.net/user/saltyim/twtxt.txt> I just learned that GoToSocial [got a grant](https://gts.superseriousbusiness.org/@gotosocial/statuses/01GGF7154RG405DC77BY4J24BJ) from NLNet. Maybe instead off applying for Salty, apply for Yarn?
2022-12-16T15:46:26Z	(#uuqfnyq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> lucky you that can escape doing business with Amazon. Around 70% of my shoppings (wants and needs) goes to Amazon.
2022-12-16T16:23:15Z	(#fxjn2na) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> meanwhile here I am, wishing temperatures would drop, at least, to 15ºC. It is a lovely click, and I super envy your snow! Let me be exhausted, please! 😅
2022-12-16T16:28:38Z	(#q7jniva) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I used to manage an organisation within Google for Domains (now Google Workspace). DKIM and SPF records were added automatically to the domains, the issue you are describing never was for me. You can always delete the synthetic records that Google creates, and add everything manually.
2022-12-16T17:20:05Z	(#jupoztq) @<axodys https://octobloc.xyz/user/axodys/twtxt.txt> which static generator are you using on your Axodys blog? I like the templates you are using!
2022-12-17T03:14:43Z	(#jupoztq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> the Fediverse is the winner on this one. It has truly become rich with lots of people moving in—mostly to Mastodon, but to other places too. Even governments are setting up instances.
2022-12-17T06:21:21Z	(#sn2xlpq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I wasn’t clear, sorry. I was referring to Axodys’ twt, and the Twitter debacle in general. It was the spawning pods mention that drove my comment, because it reminded me of what’s happening right now.  I believe that each community has its niche, so I agree with your assertion.
2022-12-18T05:00:15Z	I heard Elizabeth Yarn was seeing with John Mastodon two days ago. I wonder what those two are up to.
2022-12-18T14:11:59Z	(#ipmcbhq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> you are, they tried but it wouldn’t work out. It was something set to fail from the start. 😂
2022-12-18T14:13:59Z	(#ipmcbhq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is reference to [this](https://boingboing.net/2022/12/18/mastodon-users-embrace-columnists-funny-error-about-a-fictitious-john-mastodon.html). 😊
2022-12-18T20:48:01Z	(#bcshgcq) @<axodys https://octobloc.xyz/user/axodys/twtxt.txt> interesting enough, it doesn’t list Youtube (major), nor Tumblr (minor). Of course, twtxt isn’t on the list neither, but I doubt Melon Husk knows what it is.
2022-12-19T00:00:25Z	(#kbiy7ta) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> see: https://mastodon.tonywebster.com/@tony/109537085935068143
2022-12-20T01:11:12Z	(#7lereha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it doesn’t 404 for me.
2022-12-20T12:25:36Z	(#6jqbdnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> well, https://pixelfed.social/users/win0err.atom
2022-12-20T19:28:46Z	(#cp67gsq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I have always open them at the base, the point they attach to the tree.
2022-12-21T18:01:53Z	(#oabhcpq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> this is also being done by news networks, and some major companies. The Fedi is certainly experiencing a boom like no other. Mastodon is clearly the winner, but other Fedi servers are also getting noticed, and used, more.
2022-12-21T18:06:02Z	(#w4il6na) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> wow, such a nice setup! Some say the Studio Display is overpriced, but once you have seeing one, and used it a little, you will find the price fitting. Congratulations!
2022-12-21T21:00:12Z	(#yppfwgq) I knew that being a fucking cursing Aussie would one day come to bite you, @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>! 🤣
2022-12-21T21:11:07Z	(#bukmc7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> no, they will still keep the open source free, and will continue the development of it. From your point of view, nothing, absolutely nothing has changed, and there are zero reasons for switching.
2022-12-21T22:37:45Z	(#bukmc7q) @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> oi, you mentioned the “F” (federation) word. Enough for @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> not to even touch it. :-P
2022-12-22T00:56:41Z	(#o5hr3nq) "Your money is not charity" but an investment in global security, President Zelenskyy tells the US Congress. "You can speed up our victory.”
2022-12-22T00:57:47Z	(#o5hr3nq) "Christmas in Ukraine may be celebrated by candlelight because of lack of electricity, says President Zelenskyy."
2022-12-22T00:59:28Z	(#o5hr3nq) "This struggle will determine in what world our children and grandchildren will live," says President Zelenskyy.
2022-12-22T01:00:41Z	(#o5hr3nq) Zelensky: "Our two nations are allies in this battle, and next year will be a turning point. The point when Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values."
2022-12-22T01:03:52Z	(#o5hr3nq) Front-line soldiers of Ukraine asked to him bring their battle flag to the US Congress, says President Zelenskyy. "Let this flag stay with you. This flag is a symbol of our victory."
2022-12-22T01:13:44Z	(#5xlc2qa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is over now, but it was a very good speech. When a transcription is ready, I will link it.
2022-12-22T02:16:43Z	(#o5hr3nq) The entire transcript (with relevant annotations) is [now available](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/us/politics/transcript-zelensky-speech.html).
2022-12-22T13:06:31Z	(#ou7x5jq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> is baking! 😍 What is it? Gingerbread cookies? Share a pic of the results, no matter how they come out, please! 😊
2022-12-22T15:01:50Z	(#ou7x5jq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> duh! Didn’t occurred to me that it was gingerbread what he was baking. I am such a dummy.
2022-12-22T20:20:31Z	(#dvrq7bq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don’t see the OP ever interacting with anyone. I could also say “email was fun while it lasted. Thanks for all the good memories.” 😂😂😂
2022-12-22T22:52:44Z	(#ou7x5jq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> those look yummy, and I am bookmarking the recipe for trying it in the future. Thanks!
2022-12-23T02:23:24Z	(#drcwcna) Maybe something like this: https://github.com/FiloSottile/passage
2022-12-23T17:34:54Z	(#iwren5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> they are sci-fi movies, not real life. 😂
2022-12-25T05:03:33Z	(#6nabnda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is 00:03, 25 December. About to go to sleep. 😂 Merry Christmas!
2022-12-25T21:06:34Z	(#mjf3zja) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> no, Bender is Bender, and Justamoment is just Justamoment. We are not the same entity.
2022-12-26T21:22:07Z	(#6k2pwsq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> that is an UX nightmare, specially on mobile.
2022-12-27T14:43:33Z	(#kvq5ccq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> enjoy it! (sooo jely here!). What model and brand is that desk? Is it stand up desk, that does lowers too? Asking because I am on the market for one. 😊
2022-12-28T19:39:00Z	(#ys42b3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> LOL. Better is to replace the switch with a smart-home compliant one.
2022-12-28T19:45:16Z	(#mdy36iq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> they exist, but they are mostly blocked/de-federated. And when new ones pop, they are swiftly taken care of.
2022-12-28T22:37:33Z	(#zfa54kq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt>  no analytics here.
2022-12-29T18:20:21Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> setting the "Start Page” to “Discover” does nothing. It is not working.
2022-12-30T17:17:04Z	(#e25oz7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> has given outstanding replies, mine is much, much, sorter: I prefer 140-500 characters reads (many are fine, as long as each remain that short). Ain’t nobody got time to watch some guy with an annoying voice ramble! 😂
2022-12-31T00:49:19Z	(#dyd3jrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> you didn’t buy into it, but your twt seems to be encouraging people to watch it. 😉
2023-01-02T18:41:15Z	(#vuw6awq) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> it should be https://nrw.social/@cblte.
2023-01-04T22:05:57Z	(#en4agmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> make sure to save the information on that “throwaway” email, as you will need it in the future. You could have created an outlook.com account, it is free.  I get it you are ranting, and complaining about the way Microsoft has mismanaged the game, but creating a random, used-for-the-game-only email is trivial. There was no need for your 1, 2, and 3 steps, if you, indeed, went through all of that. 🤣
2023-01-05T01:35:14Z	(#xzi7m6q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it shows as `@darch@neotxt`. That’s wrong.
2023-01-07T12:49:18Z	(#5czjhfq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> run `yarnd -help` (or two dashes, I forgot). There is an option to set the fetch interval.
2023-01-10T12:47:15Z	(#ob3tdza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what’s next, get rid of CSS? 😂 Do you de-badge your cars (remove all lettering from them)? Though one might engage in monologues, sometimes it is worth to know one isn’t talking to the void.  Are you paying for micro.blog? If so, why?
2023-01-10T12:51:03Z	(#e4mx67q) @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> LOL.
2023-01-10T23:50:57Z	(#34ty2iq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I feel the same for software subscriptions. It was cute when there was one; now everyone wants you to subscribe to use their app. Slowly falling back to vanilla apps for everything.
2023-01-11T04:45:28Z	(#34ty2iq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> I use iOS and macOS. Both come with very good vanilla apps (calendar, mail, web browser, messaging, notes, etc.).
2023-01-11T12:24:18Z	(#wc3s2na) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> is there a spec for it? If so, what do the spec says? What if someone wants to use `../img/avatar.png`, are you going to support it too?
2023-01-11T18:17:47Z	(#pyl6vmq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> what changed that made you join?
2023-01-11T18:21:26Z	@<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> every service that you used to host, but Yarn, is pretty much gone (410). Are they really?
2023-01-11T18:44:03Z	(#pyl6vmq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> yes, what you describe has been around for ages on that site/platform. Metafilter is old! That was mostly behind my question. I used to have an account (probably still do), but I have not been around there in years.
2023-01-11T20:10:12Z	(#mq6v6fq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> start muting/blocking, my friend. 🤣
2023-01-11T20:58:22Z	(#mq6v6fq) They are same accounts on completely different domains.

2023-01-15T14:49:05Z	(#xrkgfpa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> well, Microsoft bought GitHub, not git. As for Gitea, there is always Gogs.
2023-01-15T18:10:33Z	(#xrkgfpa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I don’t mean to insult, but git does what git was made to do, from get go. Because Microsoft bought a business that arguably added value to git I am not going to move to yet another tool. And I am not even a developer, but use git on a daily basics.  Drew DeVault would say you only need git, patch, and email. 😂

2023-01-17T00:27:22Z	(#gy7olva) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yup. I would sweared it was once supported, but I might be mistaking.
2023-01-18T12:09:29Z	(#feqgkqa) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> the Yarn running at twtxt.net has horizontal scrolling issues on mobile (Safari, Chrome). It has other issues too, but the one @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> refers to has been around since you took over CSS.
2023-01-18T13:11:52Z	(#feqgkqa) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> test it on your own mobile device, whatever that might happen to be. It has to be at twtxt.net. There are also tools that allows you to emulate.
2023-01-18T15:52:59Z	(#io5hatq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> is it deployed at twtxt.net? If so, then it is still broken. I am just replying based on what @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> reported. I don’t run Yarn.
2023-01-18T18:03:16Z	(#feqgkqa) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> is right. The slight horizontal scrolling occurs where there is a `textarea`.
2023-01-18T18:04:30Z	(#feqgkqa) I can’t test the horizontal scrolling on neotxt.dk because I don’t have a test account to try it. To see if it is there, one most be logged in.
2023-01-18T18:19:17Z	(#feqgkqa) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> that’s the point we are trying to make: the issue is here on twtxt.net. While logged out, I don’t see the problem (same as in your pod). While logged in, on portions where there is no `textarea` the problem isn’t present either. It is while logged in, on pages where you can enter text on a `textarea`, that the problem arises.
2023-01-18T18:30:16Z	(#ozqphna) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> it seems settled that it doesn’t show on Android browsers. It is an issue on iOS. Mind tossing me a test account (delete after my test), to see if it is an issue on twtxt.net only, or something generalised?
2023-01-18T19:30:18Z	@<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt>, the “Settings” screen has issues as well. I can screenshot it and twtxt about it, but it is easier to see. Click on “Settings” and see the alignment of the three blue buttons, and width in comparison with the rest of the page. This on both, desktop, and mobile.
2023-01-18T20:14:49Z	(#y463i3a) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> on “Timeline”, inspect any of the `<article id>` tags. Their computed width is 834px. Now go to “Settings”, and inspect any `<article>`. Their computed width is 802px.  The way I see it, this is what causing this specific problem (the commented out padding):  ``` .tabs .tab {     order: 99;     width: 100%;     display: none;     /* padding: 1rem; */ } ```  Anyway, I am not a frontend designer.

2023-01-18T20:42:06Z	(#y463i3a) The `.tabs .tab` classes are applied to a `<div>` on “Settings". That padding is pushing the `<article>` tabs. What do you use for content creation, Microsoft Windows?
2023-01-18T20:50:39Z	(#y463i3a) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> where did I mention scrolling on this yarn?
2023-01-18T21:29:50Z	(#ynd4qxq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> he means she is doing something right.
2023-01-18T22:36:25Z	(#2dt2hza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> there are little oddities, all observed while using the desktop. On Safari, the yarns count is floating down below “Yarn”, or on the side of it. I will post a screenie.
2023-01-18T22:45:38Z	(#2dt2hza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> finally, someone sees it! And a legally blind person, of all! 🙈

2023-01-21T17:40:15Z	(#fzu257a) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> it is fixed in your pod, yes. Good job!
2023-01-21T23:40:49Z	(#ij7ebua) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> thank you! I hope the third round was smoothly too. Just got another 5 gallons of paint, will finish it next weekend. I also bought cheaper paint for the old side fence too. Next is to prep an exercise room on the lanai for the kid. Got the epoxy paint today too, to paint the floor. Fun! :-D
2023-01-21T23:42:12Z	(#ij7ebua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> hehehe, I had to make haste because rain was menacing. The new wood absorbed the paint like a sponge, hopefully next coat fixes the little imperfections.
2023-01-22T02:25:08Z	(#gzqhooa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I would certainly limit the amount of links one can have. If you were to ask me for a number I would say four links, maximum.
2023-01-22T03:02:47Z	(#7odmkmq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> LOL. I am truly surprised someone still uses Keybase. 😅
2023-01-22T18:59:25Z	(#dlbntsa) I believe this is a huge misunderstanding, probably driven by the fact that @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> first language isn’t English. I don’t see any correlation between his replies to yours, @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>. So I, too, am lost.
2023-01-22T19:02:52Z	(#dlbntsa) I wanted to add that—at least for me—it is hard to follow long twtxts, especially because I come here on mobile. I see twtxt as microblogging, and adjust my attention span accordingly. 😂🙈
2023-01-22T19:06:41Z	(#ccj6pha) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> I have no idea on what it means.
2023-01-22T19:11:50Z	(#sl7ojtq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> as I said on another twtxt, you and I both. 😩

2023-01-23T17:34:42Z	(#im45t7a) Ah, the UK, I see. All this time I figured you were Brit. It’s now I realise you were (are) originally a Canuck! :-)
2023-01-23T19:11:25Z	(#im45t7a) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> I once heard the UK immigration process was hellishly long. You have proved it now. In the States, once you get a Permanent Residence, you wait five years, and can apply for naturalisation. I understand, though, that getting into the country legally, and obtaining that Permanent Residence to start with, can be quite hard.
2023-01-23T19:12:39Z	(#fh2laiq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> that looks quite nice! I wouldn’t even get close, and I dabbled some calligraphy in the very far past.
2023-01-24T00:03:29Z	(#gaapgna) It is because Australian bigotry, I figure, for what I have read. It seems AC/DC means “having a bisexual orientation” for Australians. And that, of course, is taboo.
2023-01-24T00:06:02Z	(#ya7ww2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> but he is @<eldersnake https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt>! From where did the one you used on this mention came from?

2023-01-30T02:11:05Z	(#ahfv4xq) It seems we need a true database that will be used to render the web client, and no simply an ephemeral cache.
2023-01-30T19:30:12Z	(#x7b3vsa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> how about not a “click to load”, but if I get into a conversation, the related twt are fetched on demand, without interaction?
2023-01-30T21:04:07Z	(#bfoni5a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> flawed is the right word, no harsh at all. Good reading, and thanks for supporting the possibility of convincing @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> to switch to a database! :-D :-P
2023-01-30T21:08:35Z	(#si4pzcq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> lovely trek, and a long one indeed! Quite a bit to see on those photos. You got goats fighting, a picture perfect in the middle of nowhere (frame and all), a church, seemingly vast parches of land, snow, ice, a castle, a village, greenery, etc., etc., etc. Wow, it fees as if you walked through different seasons too! Well done, mate, well done.
2023-01-31T11:37:17Z	(#5oje4nq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> how come you addressed eldersnake like this? Did you hit reply?
2023-01-31T12:05:19Z	(#5oje4nq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ooooh! I see! I didn’t know you were using the mobile app, otherwise I wouldn’t have asked. I though there was a problem on the web interface (JS, or something related). By using the “old” addressing style, it simply randomises amongst the many similarly named, but different TLDs followings you have, right?
2023-01-31T14:38:47Z	(#uyobzda) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> they are saving the username, just in case. If twtxt.net becomes popular, they could sell them for some coins (virtual coins, that is). 😂
2023-01-31T15:54:08Z	(#jmxqaua) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> what have you done?! Oh noooo! 😅
2023-02-01T02:02:09Z	(#hhsmcea) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> please give us a heads up if you are linking to Twitter. On mobile I have no way to know, and I am trying my best to avoid that hellhole.
2023-02-01T02:49:52Z	(#47ahtla) @<screem https://twtxt.net/user/screem/twtxt.txt> I am the wrong one to chime on this, as I don’t use them. The only reason I am replying here is because I find they take too much space, and are distracting as well.   I think your approach is better than current. Add some padding to the left (when filters are visible), and tone down that fly in/out that will make me dizzy, and you got yourself a winner!
2023-02-01T11:59:22Z	(#eevyspa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don’t need the conditional. A simple [verbal warning](https://twitter.com)(Twitter) suffices.
2023-02-01T12:35:10Z	(#hhsmcea) @<akoizumi https://social.chaotic.ninja/user/akoizumi/twtxt.txt> fitting indeed! 😂
2023-02-01T20:21:25Z	(#m3awvjq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> yeah, you mess it up, or something. Ultimately, I blame @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>. Yes, let’s do that. :-D
2023-02-01T22:29:02Z	(#eevyspa) @<prologic https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is. I could opt for not following any link, but that would hamper interaction, and camaraderie. Out of politeness, I would like to know if a link I can’t see goes to Twitter, so that I can avoid it.
2023-02-01T22:32:09Z	(#eevyspa) Nothing to be done by you. I asked the OP. 😊
2023-02-01T22:40:09Z	(#4fjnmhq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> right now the safest bet, if you want to use the very many, and very nice mobile apps, is Mastodon. That’s bound to change, though.
2023-02-01T22:44:03Z	(#qm3awvjq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> another headless twt?

2023-02-01T23:07:26Z	(#vkmvp7a) @<axodys https://octobloc.xyz/user/axodys/twtxt.txt> is that the app based on Nostr?
2023-02-01T23:19:58Z	(#vkmvp7a) @<axodys https://octobloc.xyz/user/axodys/twtxt.txt> add me! :-)  ``` npub1fzsnac6k335u7tmjmrhalyyp78ccq3t4vyx7m2zchafax2eeqaxqx3kj5s ```
2023-02-02T12:53:56Z	(#cac2cxq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> you have got the whole Zit family. I bet @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> is so jealous! Maybe he will get the Bogan family on his pod. That would be so swell! :-)
2023-02-02T13:54:20Z	I am still trying it, but I have to say—so far—nostr is a royal, and absolute, mess. As expected crypto bros everywhere, but also porn, all scams you can  imagine, and more.
2023-02-02T15:57:35Z	(#hq7z3va) I bet I can find uses for it, but do I really want to? Say, I setup my own closed relay, and share it with family and friends. It all comes down to the quality of the client then.
2023-02-02T18:47:20Z	(#oqfcuiq) @<axodys https://octobloc.xyz/user/axodys/twtxt.txt> I found it, but also found it to be lame, and uninteresting. I am not going to get rid of my private/public keys, and probably will not uninstall the app quite yet, but unless something changes radically I don’t see me using it much, if at all.
2023-02-02T22:14:43Z	(#oqfcuiq) And just like that, my affair with nostr is over. :-D
2023-02-03T02:57:13Z	(#hc2vrba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> anybody can run a relay. I briefly ran one today. There are hundreds out there.
2023-02-03T12:51:55Z	(#cuflflq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> I hear you. As always, hope for the best, but prepare for the worse. I am thousands of kilometres away, yet it is also always in the back of my mind.
2023-02-03T13:22:06Z	(#4zy46aq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> it will be nice to be able to read in what context Weizenbaum wrote that. It comes from an article he wrote, "Social and Political Impact of the Long-term History of computing”, which I haven’t been able to find without selling my soul. I understand you are a scholar; could you “lend” us the article? PDF is fine. :-)
2023-02-03T14:42:46Z	(#anlhsfa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> this [was requested](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/560) in the past, but has not being implemented.
2023-02-03T14:59:35Z	(#4zy46aq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I got it. Thank you very much for sharing!

2023-02-03T23:10:08Z	(#er65o2a) @<axodys https://octobloc.xyz/user/axodys/twtxt.txt> I tried Iris, yes. Is OK. I proved to myself that Nostr will not work with just my own relay. Even if the latency is 1ms, all the clients will crawl to a stop with only my relay. It seems it is meant to use many relays, which I don’t like.  I also don’t have—nor want, not even free—any cryptocurrency, so that portion of the protocol is of no use, nor interest to me. Have fun, though! :-)
2023-02-03T23:23:34Z	(#hysqlbq) @<eldersnake https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> the rules, as they were planning it, were truly bad. I pay premium for 4K, and multiple devices. It is none of their business where those devices might be, as long as I pay the premium to play on them. Anything else is completely stupid, irrational, and I will not bear with it if, or when, it gets instituted.
2023-02-04T00:02:30Z	(#anlhsfa) @<prologic https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don’t care, as long as it is possible to upload a file (PDF in this instance, but why to stop there?) that can be linked in similar ways as images.
2023-02-04T04:36:46Z	(#exnd2xa) @<axodys https://octobloc.xyz/user/axodys/twtxt.txt> only one client. I was stumped myself, so I tried another relay to make sure. Same result.   I also came across Nick Fuentes, and other extreme right wingers. Not my kind of crowd.

2023-02-04T05:13:23Z	(#2rkvp7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> a web client I used reported 1ms.
2023-02-04T05:18:28Z	(#2rkvp7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is supposed to be fine, but it takes eons for clients to show you text you have posted.
2023-02-04T13:59:04Z	(#bfbchba) Yeah, you know what? Just take it from me, and stop hurting your head with it: keep away from that shit. At least for now. It is absolutely worthless.
2023-02-04T17:57:07Z	(#kthy2ya) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> you wrote;  > “The Fediverse fractured, mostly because some percentage of users, had to find a way to silence those offensive to them, for the entirety of their instance”  It is called moderation. Often people can get away by blocking individuals. In extreme cases entire instances must be blocked.  I also don’t understand the sanitation you are referring to. You don’t interact with what you don’t like, or agree with. You won’t find nazis in my timelines, or fanatic religiosity. Everyone creates their own space.  If “this place” were to become one day unsuitable for me, I would move on. Not the first, not the last.   I always ask myself first, though, “is it me?” Sometimes it is me, and I learn, and I try hard to change.  @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> said it better than me. You don’t have the facts at hand, and your reply rose eyebrows, and least at my end.
2023-02-05T02:45:32Z	(#k5dgh7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> add mute by language. 😊
2023-02-05T02:57:06Z	(#k5dgh7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> pattern based filtering can get quite expensive, no? If not, then it would be nice to have, of course. And, as I wrote before, language.
2023-02-05T04:27:06Z	(#5vsj2sq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> check your junk location. It might be there.
2023-02-05T04:30:18Z	(#5vsj2sq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> hmm, in that case SMTP might not be configured correctly.
2023-02-05T06:05:42Z	This is awesome! (in bed, but having a hard time falling asleep tonight). 😅
2023-02-05T06:06:23Z	Hmm, maybe isn’t working right.
2023-02-05T06:07:11Z	Now trying the fork on this one.
2023-02-05T06:09:17Z	Remember I reply, normally, from “Discovery”.

2023-02-05T06:22:34Z	Let’s see now. This is a fork off https://twtxt.net/twt/iuxyejq, picked from “Discovery”.
2023-02-05T06:24:23Z	Reply isn’t showing the handle of the person being replied to.
2023-02-05T06:25:21Z	I just hit reply to the “Which I think I fixed 🤔” twt.
2023-02-05T06:25:53Z	It isn’t. 😩
2023-02-05T06:29:17Z	Go to “Discovery”, and tap reply to anything.
2023-02-05T06:33:38Z	Brand new twt.

2023-02-05T06:39:56Z	Reply to “I’m starting to feel quite …” I am 100% on mobile.
2023-02-05T06:42:05Z	(#fmhylya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is not that. It is some JavaScript issue.
2023-02-05T06:42:45Z	(#fmhylya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I have to hit reply twice to see your handle pop.

2023-02-05T06:44:24Z	(#fmhylya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> sounds good!
2023-02-05T13:51:31Z	So, I found a few oddities while on mobile.  * From “Timeline”, I need to tap reply twice to have it fill the user’s handle being replied to. * From “Mentions”, “Discovery”, and inside Yarns, I need to almost spam it, to have it fill the user’s handle being replied to.  That doesn’t happen while on the desktop.
2023-02-05T13:52:10Z	(#hs7sjba) Tagging @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, so this doesn’t fall through the cracks. :-D
2023-02-05T13:54:34Z	(#hs7sjba) I am replying here while in “/conv”, on mobile now.
2023-02-05T13:55:34Z	I am replying again, just taping reply once. Once course, since I am replying to myself I don’t see my handle. For this one I tapped once on reply.
2023-02-05T13:56:15Z	(#sntvrfa) Yup, even when replying to myself I need to spam “Reply”.
2023-02-05T14:00:12Z	(#hs7sjba) So, to sum it up, Yarn reply interaction has issues while on mobile (I forgot to mention same applies to “**Fork**” while on mobile). I might follow Lyse’s (@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>) advise, and "just don't use it on your telephone, you social addict!” :-D
2023-02-05T21:20:39Z	(#sntvrfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it happens, JavaScript sucks, but it is also so good! :-)
2023-02-05T23:46:48Z	(#hs7sjba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yup, all good. Just replying here for closure.
2023-02-06T00:09:59Z	(#d5tbgsa) (#d5tbgsa) @<prologic https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> funny enough, that one on cache is wrong, as the cache doesn’t have the right one. Bottomline #yggk2lq doesn’t really exist. 😬

2023-02-07T14:05:07Z	(#udmmvha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> right, it isn’t blank, as you saw. I don’t see it as a failure. After all, it is an apptest account, right? :-)

2023-02-11T19:20:14Z	(#qn2pcqq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> there is already some telemetry in it. You can query a pod to find a few stats about it. Granted, it is passive, not “dialling out”.
2023-02-12T00:01:39Z	(#oyvxhoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I will play devil’s advocate. The telemetry being proposed for the go tool chain is opt-out. I think opt-out is better that being “based on honour”. It is also meant to “see, and fix broken shit” 😜😂  Also, I bet most running Yarn do not even know about it. 😬😂
2023-02-12T18:51:34Z	(#bzubzqq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> sunset was good! I will send one of mine, once our long Winter week is over. 😂
2023-02-12T20:37:07Z	(#qwxfdta) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Nanook has to have to cleanest teeth I have ever seeing in a dog. It is also a handsome one!
2023-02-12T23:22:49Z	(#4ayfxjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is a Husky.
2023-02-12T23:28:26Z	(#4ayfxjq) I know this because I searched his raw twtxt.txt, and found it there. If only we had a decent search! 😩
2023-02-13T13:37:28Z	(#v4rlsma) @<ychbn https://twtxt.net/user/ychbn/twtxt.txt> yes, Yarn does some caching that is pretty ephemeral. If you are gone long enough, nothing will show under your profile. As far as the web interface is concerned, you will not exist. Same for everything else. Granted, you still can check your—and others—text file (if you are into that kind of thing), but Yarn will not show it to you in a browsable manner (like this twt).
2023-02-13T13:44:09Z	(#v4rlsma) So, the “Timeline” you are using on your website, that links here, isn’t a good idea.
2023-02-14T12:13:42Z	(#2l5clma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> is it a Linux distribution based on Gentoo. I am not sure with C(11) means but, truly, I don’t need to know. :-)
2023-02-14T14:24:21Z	(#gz5euha) Say what you want, I speak for myself. People way much, much, much smarter than me are working on this. Not one, but many. AI will have its use—which it will increase—and it will get better. It is barely on its infancy.  About perceived impossibilities, we are very good at achieving things that previously seemed impossible.
2023-02-14T14:56:39Z	(#gzerdja) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> everything is on its infancy, relatively speaking. I mean, your 1940s example is merely 82 years old. What is that? Nothing.  The fact is, we don’t know what we don’t know. The argument is not giving up. It is a way to say “I am not knowledgable enough—not will ever be—to speak on that matter."
2023-02-14T17:50:30Z	(#h5nlkkq) @<dkordic https://twtxt.net/user/dkordic/twtxt.txt> they can be had, if you use your fork right. :-)
2023-02-14T17:55:45Z	(#kxt2sua) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> very nice click! Which lens is that? Using tripod, or not?
2023-02-14T21:40:53Z	(#p5wwiva) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> 😍😍😍. I have got to visit, check out your Pleroma, and see if my credentials are still valid. That will be the ultimate test! 😊🙈
2023-02-16T00:07:47Z	(#v3ncp5q) @<cel https://celehner.com/twtxt.txt> there are many themes for vim. You just need to pick, and customise the one you like. But no, twtxt doesn’t have a specific vim colour scheme for you to use. You will have to make your own.
2023-02-19T02:27:48Z	(#sjbulva) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> not here. We are always watching, always watching you! 😂
2023-02-19T15:04:03Z	(#b2hbv2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> very, very nice! Very well done! Now, that wasn’t too difficult, was it? 😂
2023-02-19T15:04:53Z	(#b2hbv2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what’s next? What’s the roadmap to full back and forth? Don’t lose momentum now! 😊
2023-02-19T15:20:38Z	(#4k57gwa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> looks good! The last part is needed for the first part to make sense. Following ActivityPub actors require receiving, at least, notes/posts from them. Granted, likes and re-blogs aren’t necessary, but posts themselves are.
2023-02-19T20:37:21Z	(#zjuy6kq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> trying to add someone on an ActivityPub server (Mastodon in this case) places the follow as “requested”, and since there is no way to approve on Yarn, it remains in limbo.
2023-02-19T22:51:34Z	(#zjuy6kq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> right, it doesn’t, so it seems a bug. Also, if I update profile in Yarn, it doesn’t update it for AP.
2023-02-19T22:57:05Z	(#5cbqssq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what do you mean? Is it something I need to do, or are you saying that is a missing part on the implementation?
2023-02-20T13:06:09Z	(#4u6tosq) I don’t have a test Mastodon server. I am assuming you are after being able to peek at logs in one, otherwise you could just create an account on any existing one (if no logs access is required).  I check logs (I am really having a hard time finding useful logs on Mastodon), and all I can see is: ``` method=GET path=/@bender@twtxt.net format=html controller=HomeController action=index status=200 duration=248.79 view=158.94 db=84.15 ``` Which is not much.
2023-02-20T13:09:41Z	(#4u6tosq) Also: ``` path=/users/david/inbox format=json controller=ActivityPub::InboxesController action=create status=401 duration=75.44 view=1.17 db=1.83 key=https://twtxt.net/user/bender/ ```
2023-02-20T13:12:49Z	(#4u6tosq) Perhaps check https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/follow_requests/, to start? I know my follow requests from Mastodon are ending up on pending.
2023-02-20T22:50:43Z	(#3b5qtnq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> that board is a tiny one! Equivalent to Raspberry Zero, right? What are you planning to use it for? I ordered three Lenovos ThinkCentre M910Q tiny desktop computers a week ago, and I can’t wait till I put my hands on them. Going to dabble with a microk8s cluster.
2023-02-21T15:10:00Z	(#2p5jzrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I say, revamp the whole login to be like micro.blog does it. Enter email, you receive a link to login. Drop a cookie. Rinse and repeat.
2023-02-22T01:16:50Z	(#3ah5h3a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I am extremely curious. What is “tharbon”? 😅
2023-02-22T15:29:02Z	(#3ah5h3a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> 😂. I think combining words would be a logical streamlining of the language. That’s why German is so streamlined (those long words that encapsulate an idea, or a sentence). I propose “thaton" to be used instead of “that on”!  Oh, and Google says it is "tio plu”, but don’t quote it (chat bots can be wrong).
2023-02-22T21:57:45Z	(#xaeygjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> to add to this, careful with ActivityPub and domains. Once you have an ActivityPub running, you will need to save its keys, because other instances you have federated with will expect them not to change. I am not fully sure of the details, but I have heard you might be disallowed from using the same domain again, if such keys were to change, because it will break federation.
2023-02-22T22:48:30Z	(#4dprv3q) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> that’s pretty cool! First time I see it up close, and not like a moon floating from afar.
2023-02-23T11:35:16Z	(#nuu7dxa) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> now, that’s progress! I logged on Pleroma without any issue. Very, very well done! 🥳🎉
2023-02-23T20:41:08Z	(#wmw35xa) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> before your twt can “show up” on the Fediverse, your account needs to be discoverable. It isn’t. Searching for `@stigatle@yarn.stigatle.no`, or `stigatle@yarn.stigatle.no` renders no results. After your account shows up, and someone can follow you, then anything you type here will be seeing by your follower.
2023-02-23T20:51:51Z	(#wmw35xa) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> I am not sure what are the steps on Yarn for that. I will have to ping @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, so that he can chime in. I am searching for your handle on my Mastodon server.
2023-02-23T20:53:44Z	(#wmw35xa) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> you might need open profile. Do that, and let me know.
2023-02-23T20:56:36Z	(#wmw35xa) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> I can’t still browse to your profile. I get a login screen.
2023-02-23T21:00:37Z	(#wmw35xa) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> yes, that was it. Now if you twt anything I should be able to see it on Mastodon.
2023-02-23T21:02:30Z	(#o4jkd4a) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt>, yup.  ![TWT on Mastodon](https://twtxt.net/media/cveJCbxnz5zj8RoZ48N9VJ.png)
2023-02-23T21:04:46Z	(#o4jkd4a) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> no problem. Now if @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> would stop being lazy, and finish it! 😂 As you can see, it still shows requested, when I actually followed you, and it also doesn’t allow replies from Mastodon to be seeing by you.
2023-02-24T00:52:24Z	(#k4ykyaq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> they didn’t hear you, the mention is wrong.

2023-03-01T20:34:27Z	(#3nq6dla) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> I don’t understand what you are trying to say. Visa and Mastercard have decided to place their crypto dabbling on hold. Who wanted to rely on Visa and Mastercard, which also "missed the whole point of crypto, to begin with”? You lost me there.
2023-03-01T21:14:48Z	(#3nq6dla) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> ah, I understand it now. Thanks.
2023-03-03T13:17:28Z	(#xvurpta) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> it solves not crashing Yarn. The bigger it is, the more memory/CPU it will consume.

2023-03-06T11:35:30Z	(#rs62afa) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> what do you mean? I haven’t replied. What happened here? 😂
2023-03-06T12:20:59Z	(#rs62afa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> he must have edited it, or something. As you can see, the connection from this one is broken.
2023-03-06T13:18:55Z	(#rs62afa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> you know what I think about “the cache”. No comments. 😬😂
2023-03-06T16:45:55Z	(#jyejv3a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I don’t think so, no.

Let us know if interested. Thanks!
2023-03-07T22:50:33Z	(#vuefica) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yup, yup. Another. Reply in Indonesian, let’s see how it goes. :-D
2023-03-08T03:40:14Z	(#uyjwuga) @<darren https://twtxt.net/user/darren/twtxt.txt> I don’t understand the hype. You are not the first one to highly recommend it. Since many did the same I rented it a month ago, or so. Couldn’t go beyond 20 minutes—and that was me trying my best to like it. I just couldn’t.
2023-03-08T12:42:41Z	(#yy2couq) @<screem https://twtxt.net/user/screem/twtxt.txt> that I know of, it is not possible to remove twts right now without getting dirty on the filesystem/cache, right @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>? So, web based tools are lacking, even for administrators.
2023-03-08T13:34:05Z	(#yy2couq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> will that remove the twt from twtxt.txt?
2023-03-09T20:40:30Z	(#xglhwgq) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> woah! What happened here?
2023-03-10T00:46:01Z	(#omzn2jq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes. De-federating is breaking federation with the specific instance, no interaction, a block. The instance being blocked has no saying, and can’t do anything about it. Well, it can change course, and correct issues, but other than that no much else.
2023-03-10T02:04:06Z	(#x3s22ua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> well, one can be fully controlled by a totalitarian government that’s considered adversarial. They are, allegedly, addressing security, not privacy concerns.
2023-03-16T12:26:27Z	(#fesxt7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I would say both, or neither. I am just uninterested, that’s as simple as it gets. Also, this reply of yours is completely disconnected on Mastodon.
2023-07-27T17:42:19Z	(#72laiqa) The Tubes know almost everything: https://user-agents.net/string/go-http-client-2-0
2023-07-27T17:57:31Z	(#4sbpj2q) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> the real question is, will it bend?
2023-07-27T17:57:50Z	(#4sbpj2q) I can bend just about anything. I am Bender!
2023-07-28T11:34:55Z	(#4sbpj2q) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> your website https://thecanine.ueuo.com doesn’t seem to exist within the US. It renders nothing.
2023-07-30T14:29:02Z	(#xt5vyxq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> the link is literally at the bottom of the first page.
2023-08-02T18:23:22Z	(#3ldhjca) Nah, let’s not be lazy.
2023-08-02T18:27:23Z	(#nrtxtpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> careful there, especially with that “whatever” 😂. There is no way you can run all that on a "10 milliCores of CPU + 64MB of Memory”. It will take more than that, and it will cost more than $0.50 USD per month.
2023-08-03T11:23:05Z	(#lekpmia) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> true, indeed! All I can say is, don’t offer this at Mills. Your connectivity isn’t stable (I have come many, many times to find CloudFlare messages). You will have to rent space elsewhere, and then numbers will look differently.
2023-08-10T13:19:25Z	(#r2n2n2q) While talking about mnemonics (and perhaps going off tangent a bit), does anyone knows of a tool to generate a mnemonic from a password, and vice-versa?
2023-08-11T13:32:36Z	(#em3hj4q) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> that’s a truly sweet bike, mate! Congratulations! I got one similar many years ago, served me well for quite a bit.
2023-08-11T16:38:50Z	(#ee63oea) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> it is not about remembering, it is about converting something like:  ``` ALBimMb+bxXypHuw8bCyZ++Sby6BFNxXs1ATtm+xiEIQbTcvOvR4BaYcAs0cZduf ```  To:   ``` apple strawberry corn cat cow impertinence bloke bread stone hydrogen mountain ```  For example, and being able to use the words to “re-assemble” the password.
2023-08-11T16:40:29Z	(#ee63oea) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> the document you list is too deep. Also behind a login. I have searched The Tubes, and found nothing.
2023-08-12T02:48:00Z	(#o2itj5a) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes 😂
2023-08-14T15:03:09Z	(#kcm3duq) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> it is not about being able to use longer passphrase or not. It is about the feasibility of it. Can a relatively complex string be converted to a mnemonic, and vice-versa, without collisions?
2023-08-14T15:05:16Z	(#kcm3duq) I just saw that @<shreyan https://twtxt.net/user/shreyan/twtxt.txt> proved it possible with a short Python script. Lovely!
2023-08-14T15:09:17Z	(#xuegdaa) @<shreyan https://twtxt.net/user/shreyan/twtxt.txt> it works perfectly, thank you!
2023-08-15T17:35:19Z	(#izsda6q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I believe it is surprise.
2023-08-20T20:43:16Z	(#ny4rsta) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> work messaging/interaction is different. They are talking about the rubbish that is Discord. Enterprise messaging is work. It is very important especially whilst working remote. While at work, I have customised notifications, and yes, I almost instantly reply to queries, whether on Teams, emails, or voice (unless, of course, otherwise engaged on something else, but I multitask quite well via chat).  Checking messages once a day, and replying hours later is completely unacceptable within my work environment. It also goes against my own work ethics.
2023-08-21T12:11:33Z	(#recffwq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ain’t that the truth! Modus operandi also varies from person to person. I have co-workers that never interact on public channels, where the entire team is being pinged. I am the only one “saving face” for the entire team, by actively replying to queries, and actioning as needed. It is just the way I am, too.
2023-08-28T23:00:26Z	(#ip32f3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> cool! I am @david:netbros.com.
2023-09-11T17:34:20Z	(#kpvqbqq) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> going to the address you linked uses a `302` to send me to https://fit.eapl.me/sign_in.php. Why? It also says nothing about what it is. Finally, my phone does all that, and more, automatically; why would I come to the web to record anything?
2023-09-11T22:22:43Z	(#amfpmda) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> It records a lot (I use iPhone). Yup, it integrates with many fitness devices (other than the normal walking, running, and biking), and there are plenty apps that can use that raw data.
2023-09-12T23:04:43Z	(#l7cdjfa) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> it can be, if you chose to, yes. In my opinion, there is no other better mobile OS than iOS. (let the mobile OS war start! LOL)

For the laptop, what would its intended use be? Do you need to run Microsoft Windows? Does it needs WiFi? Destination (for power outlets)? For the phone, do you need it to be “smart”? Physical, or software SIM? Do you want it to work where you are going (destination is needed)?  Details are in the pudding.

For $70 it is easy to buy one every 6 months, if it were to be really bad. :-) Heck, my wife’s SUV eats $70/week of petrol, so… one phone per month is just fine. LOL.

2024-02-18T20:38:17Z	(#aajeezq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> a few points:  Technical:  1. Single point of failure: Relays, though decentralised, could be targeted for censorship or sabotage. 2. Message integrity: Messages are not inherently linked, raising concerns about spoofing and manipulation. 3. Data storage: Clients may need to download large amounts of data, especially historical messages, impacting performance. 4. Limited functionality: Currently focuses on text-based communication, lacking media sharing or advanced features.  Usability:  1. Steep learning curve: It is still young and requires technical knowledge for setup and use. 2. Limited user base: Finding an active community and familiar faces can be challenging. 3. Unintuitive interfaces: Client applications may not be as user-friendly as established platforms.  Also, full of crypto bros, crypto bros wanna be, and, well, worthless crypto (mixed with some porn, nazi crap, etc.). But go ahead, go through the same phases I went (I even ran my own relay), and see it for yourself. :-)
2024-02-20T21:24:01Z	I keep muting accounts here (twtxt.net), and they keep popping back on after some time. It is nuts. :-(
2024-02-21T03:00:07Z	(#jq2xtea) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> I would say yes. Maybe caching related?
2024-02-21T17:42:00Z	(#glemlpa) @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> still, I fail to understand why a "privacy" app is asking for a phone number in the first place.
2024-02-21T17:44:43Z	(#jq2xtea) It would be nice to be able to mute/block entire domains, at the user level. Say, I don't want to see any "cyberlandia.pt" related twtxts while peeking at "Discover" or anywhere else, then I simply add that domain to my "Block list".
2024-02-21T17:46:45Z	(#e5dahfq) While talking about features, I am sure "Search" remains an unused feature mostly because of its lacklustre.
2024-02-29T18:38:00Z	(#iee7bsq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> completely agree. Also, love the ability Thunderbird used to have (don't know if still does, don't use it) to allow searching for message-id, which we could use to edit emails to fix threats. I used to do it in Mutt too.
2024-03-06T13:52:26Z	(#nygq3nq) It is just an acronym that means little. You know, like most German Chocolate cakes: not German, not real chocolate. LOL.

2024-03-08T17:59:22Z	(#ymrnh2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> now, in a more serious tone, it is a US slang for "aware of, and actively attentive to, important societal facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice)".

Then you will have to spend a little on electricity too---I know it is a low consumption device, but still....  I sure hope you are not planning a retirement out of it. :-D
2024-03-12T15:31:05Z	(#xbqymeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> because for the other side it doesn't need to make sense. There is lot of hate going around, and an utter lack of education.
2024-03-12T16:15:45Z	(#qantj4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, in the US it's various factors. This is my believe, based on my own observations, and it might not be accurate.  - I think hate has been latent, but set free by the past (and current running for) president, and exacerbated by the people that have taken over the Republican party. Trump, a "populist" leader, has used (and continues to use) nationalist rhetoric and scapegoating tactics (and lies!) to gain support. This has lead to an increase in intolerance, and a decline in civility. It truly is nuts! - Trump and his allies has made their followers distrust traditional institutions like media and government, and driven them to fringe sources for information, which are rife with misinformation and hate speech. - Prices going up, because of current world economy, and reasons outside the power of single entities (governments can't fix everything). In other words, economic insecurity has made people susceptible to scapegoating and blaming others for their problems, fuelling prejudice and hate.
2024-03-12T16:28:02Z	(#qantj4a) Also, social media. Yes, that's right! Social media creates echo chambers, where people are only exposed to information that confirms (and reinforces!) their existing beliefs. This leads to increased polarisation and hostility towards people who have different viewpoints. Social media algorithms can also prioritise inflammatory content (you know it!), making it seem more prevalent than it is.
2024-03-12T16:30:08Z	(#qantj4a) Maybe increase the amount of text we can type on twtxts? I am running out of space! :-)
2024-03-13T12:28:20Z	(#7tvi5wq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I prefer not forcing people to go elsewhere to read things that relate here, within a context that exist here (a "yarn"). I have the feeling less than half will go read what you wrote on your notes---that includes me. I might be wrong.  I truly shouldn't complain. I don't participate often enough to ask for anything. :-D Instead, I will adapt.
2024-03-13T12:33:14Z	(#ovkzvfa) @mckinley, dear lord! With those odds I would never do it. Playing the lottery indeed.

2024-03-19T15:41:05Z	(#cvlovya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> meh, in my opinion you don't buy into a Lexus because of it's superb craftsmanship, engine, and technologies, as engines have been pretty rock solid in other car manufacturers (Kias, Hundais, etc.) for decades now. There is no reason to pick a Lexus specifically over a Kia, both running with engines that burn fossil fuel, as a way of transportation.  LOL. :-D
2024-03-19T18:00:49Z	(#lmyoo3q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> you can't even block/mute them. For those, like me, that use the "Discover" to see what's up, that is a little bit problematic. I live with it, though. :-)
2024-03-20T12:08:08Z	(#lmyoo3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't know what the fix will be. Ideally, since it doesn't work for bidirectional communication, get rid of the Fediverse integration? Would that stop those posts from showing up?
2024-03-21T21:23:25Z	(#hnjfvrq) It is an IPO. :-D I find more value in Reddit than Facebook. Granted, Meta is more than Facebook now a days. I am not buying any, but I wish them (Reddit Inc.), and their investors, well.
2024-03-22T11:34:32Z	(#hnjfvrq) @<shreyan https://twtxt.net/user/shreyan/twtxt.txt> companies are people too. We should remember that.
2024-03-26T13:49:01Z	(#i4fxela) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yup, that is, sadly, what's happening. It is making the "discover" worthless for my (and @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt>) use case.

2024-04-08T18:28:20Z	(#d6xxntq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> well, when you buy property you are obtaining something tangible, guaranteed. When you bet on the market (I am assuming that's what you meant by investing), you are not guaranteed.

2024-04-09T11:38:32Z	(#reqcmca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> can you be more specific? Arguably, borrowing to buy real estate might be worth it. Buying a successful, established, business might be worth it. Both are incoming producing assets.
2024-04-09T11:41:16Z	(#d6xxntq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> now you are trolling. LOL. Highest savings (or CDs) around here renders around 5%. No one is going to lend you money at that interest rate, or less, like, ever.
2024-04-09T15:54:09Z	(#d6xxntq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Goldman Sachs, through Apple, is giving 4.4% on $100K (minimum). Four months rolling CDs in our bank are giving up to 5.10% on $50K, and up. Government treasure bills are around that, some a little less, some a little more.
2024-04-09T16:01:33Z	(#d6xxntq) The kick is, if you want to borrow money, all interests are super high (10%+). You can't "borrow to invest " in a savings account.

2024-04-17T19:00:47Z	(#3j7ucpa) I think he might have a hard time knowing there is a reply, @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>. Then replying will become the next ordeal. Starting friction is strong on twtxt. That's where Yarn excelled.
2024-04-18T11:58:20Z	(#3xp2dea) Sounds good. Yarn doesn't have mobile app right now, so having a clean, decent one, would help.

2024-04-20T23:46:04Z	(#alxjruq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don’t think so:  > 2023-09-02T17:30:15Z	Hi! I'll be microblogging from ciberlandia.pt from now on. What does that mean? If you want to follow me via mastodon you can, at @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> , if you want to follow me via twtxt you can keep following me via at https://tilde.pt/~marado/twtxt.txt . See you on the "other side"!
2024-04-20T23:50:08Z	(#gtqdgla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> doesn’t UTF-8 covers Arabic as well?
2024-04-21T00:10:28Z	(#7ef2sea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it makes absolute sense for a Yarn.social user. I propose the following formatting change:  > **WARNING:**     >  > You are about to follow a legacy feed, which may not have any kind of engagement. Do you want to continue?
2024-04-21T00:11:08Z	(#y4zd7da) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I noticed you were using the mobile app. Such a brave soul! 😂
2024-04-21T00:55:21Z	(#o2xmxwq) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> a bit on the tangent, what font is that one on your screenshot?
2024-04-21T02:36:21Z	(#7vjxuoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> is that the one that hit you in the shin? 😬
2024-04-21T15:57:06Z	(#tztwmua) @<dfaria https://twtxt.net/user/dfaria/twtxt.txt> well, your “original twtxt” is an example of anything, but social. It is more like an echo chamber. If I am going to follow someone, I seek interaction. Language isn’t a barrier, lack of engagement is.
2024-04-21T16:18:18Z	I have been up, and ready to go for hours. Partner is still in bed. She takes such a long time to wake up on weekends! Past noon already, and we need to get food for the elders, and come back to tidy up things to get ready for the next weekly cycle.  Ugh! Where did the weekend go?!
2024-04-21T19:01:25Z	(#6axgyza) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> pfff, your code is “break-proof”! All looking good, so far. 😊
2024-04-21T19:02:39Z	(#x7b66yq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> hahahaha! Accurate, 100%. 😩
2024-04-22T10:58:12Z	(#vwbo3aa) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> not a problem, but I don't want to see it. When I get to see it constantly, without following it, then it becomes a problem. Blogs being echo chambers do not bother. They don't "come to me". :-D
2024-04-22T17:46:50Z	(#ujlhoma) Absolutely lovely. 🫢
2024-04-22T18:11:39Z	(#qf7pavq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I figure the same as for non-native. LOL. All translation services are doing a poor job at translating your twtxt. 😭
2024-04-22T18:13:00Z	(#qf7pavq) Google:  > I often wonder what it must be like for native English speakers to use all these so-called brand names. “I use window 11! This is a KraftPoint presentation. I got the code for this script from the idiot turnstile.” All that sort of thing.  🤣🤣🤣
2024-04-22T19:08:54Z	(#qf7pavq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> it is all in the context. When referring to computers, if the person uses Microsoft Windows, then colloquially the user “is on Windows”, for example.  For PowerPoint is simpler, as nothing else is called that way, nor have the same spelling. But yeah, similar to “gonna grab a Coke”. It is intrinsically embedded in the language.
2024-04-23T11:37:15Z	(#ujlhoma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> "it's a thing!" 🤣
2024-04-23T12:47:36Z	(#ujlhoma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> a thing, a thing! I mean, the amount of information the OP brought speaks for itself, right, right?  🫢😅
2024-04-23T14:37:13Z	Just found a pleasant way to wade through meetings: listening to Puccini's "La Bohème". Glorious!
2024-04-23T14:52:42Z	(#ujlhoma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and I believe he is an "Open Web Lead" at Automatic, and working on the ActivityPub plugin for WordPress. The theme he uses is his own. Anyway, moving on...
2024-04-23T17:23:24Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, how do I post from the terminal, using `yarnc` non-interactively? Tried something like:  ```bash echo "This is a test." | yarnc post ```  And it didn't work---it seems it wants to open an editor.
2024-04-23T17:29:51Z	Can I use yarnc to post directly to twtxt.net from the terminal? Let's see. Aha! I can. :-)
2024-04-23T17:32:01Z	(#boe5pqa) Never mind, figured out that `yarnc post -` is the way to do it. Thanks [code](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/src/commit/7fd3daeda6f2/cmd/yarnc/post.go#L62)!
2024-04-23T20:02:40Z	(#2v6ranq) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> two years after! LOL. Also, I put down $50 (USD) that OP will never see these replies. The one you replied to used the gemini protocol, and I don't think it is up on its end. OP last twtxt was <time>2023-01-04T10:40:10+01:00</time>: https://jdtron.tilde.team/twtxt.txt
2024-04-24T11:12:46Z	(#boe5pqa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> that would only be logical! :-)
2024-04-24T11:48:24Z	(#aiqtdda) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> we had one of those at the beginning of the pandemic, when everyone was sent home. It truly was painful. Now we are having another university to evaluate our processes, and procedures; not much security based, but still a pain.
2024-04-24T11:55:24Z	I am supposed to come to office today, but I have caught the same cold bug wife has had for the last three days, so I am staying remote to spare cube-mates. Nose stuck, dripping, and a general slight sense of malaise is what I am feeling right now.
2024-04-24T14:00:40Z	(#z4m2yla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thanks mate! I am trying to isolate, wearing masks at home, and washing hands constantly, to see if kid can be spared.
2024-04-24T15:24:14Z	(#aiqtdda) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> ay ay ay ay ay! Don't envy a bit on that one. I assume the software you are forced to use is proprietary, and very specific?
2024-04-24T17:19:09Z	(#z4m2yla) Thank you very much, everyone!
2024-04-24T22:13:33Z	(#d5n4myq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> it seems you don’t have a decent UPS with surge protection. Invest in one! We have one everywhere there is a constantly-used valuable appliance in the house, including refrigerator.
2024-04-25T11:16:33Z	(#dw6meza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ha! If you lived in the [lightning capital of the US](https://baynews9.com/fl/tampa/weather/2024/01/23/florida-lightning-capital-2023) you would do it too! 😅
2024-04-27T01:08:34Z	(#yptbj5q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> “let it go, Indiana”. Evidently Assistant Professor Faria can’t—or doesn’t want to—engage in civil discourse. Using Her Majesty’s proper: fuck it!
2024-04-27T01:12:45Z	(#lhfziyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think trying to please everyone is a mistake. 😈
2024-04-27T01:38:16Z	(#lhfziyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> now, the mention of multiuser pods brought an idea. What if you design, and code, single user pods that are extremely lean (extremely low processor, memory, and storage footprint), and brutally minimalist?
2024-04-27T01:39:23Z	![Screenshot of an error](https://twtxt.net/media/DFQCYVUTnsgAB2UmCmSD3A.png)   This happens more often than I would like. 😢
2024-04-27T11:20:25Z	(#lg3qbhq) @<dfaria https://twtxt.net/user/dfaria/twtxt.txt> you are not who you say you are, you are who you show to be. You demonstrated a certain lack of levelled engagement, and sound reasoning; you were borderline hysterical. All qualities everyone should have, even more so someone who has chosen the teaching path.  This is not a train terminal. No need to give so many warnings about leaving, so many “bye-byes”. If that’s your intention, just leave.
2024-04-27T12:17:19Z	(#lg3qbhq) @<dfaria https://twtxt.net/user/dfaria/twtxt.txt> plunk.
2024-04-27T12:25:04Z	(#p4xbjgq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> isn’t it evident? It surprises me you need to ask! 😂
2024-04-27T12:27:09Z	(#dzpdw6a) To expand on this, Lyse is the only person I know to send in code contributions with a full test suite. That’s awesome.
2024-04-28T01:45:11Z	(#lqnxaxa) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> here as in, here? It’s a quarter to 22:00 *here*, and after a rather tiresome day I am trying to rest, while alternating with folding freshly washed and dried clothes. Quiet indeed! 😅
2024-04-28T03:01:01Z	(#dlwuhua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> woah, such a good life! 🙈
2024-04-28T09:27:22Z	(#iq4rusa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> check the links on this twtxt. You are talking to the void. 😊
2024-04-28T16:07:02Z	(#pjzwjla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Bulma looks amazing.
2024-04-28T16:14:23Z	(#pjzwjla) Spectre also looks quite good.
2024-04-28T16:48:25Z	(#adxtcga) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> such mental punishment! 😂😂😂
2024-04-28T20:43:49Z	(#wz6g4fa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> well, if it is the master bathroom, and you are remodeling it whole, be prepared to dish out a chunk of money. We recently finished ours, and it was in the $28,000+ range. 😬
2024-04-28T20:48:13Z	(#lqnxaxa) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> it depends. It was decently busy around here (Yarn)! 🤭  This Sunday (currently 16:46 US EDT) I mowed our lawn, trimmed bushes, blowed the dust, then showered, went shopping, cooked, and just now finished eating steamed rice with chick peas stew, and finely cut spam air fried crispy. Yum! I want more, but got to stop the glutton in me. 😂
2024-04-28T20:52:20Z	(#l3erl7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> sorry to hear that mate. Feel well! 🤗
2024-04-29T01:32:29Z	(#tltyzqq) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> today I learned! Thank you! I shall use it at work to impress my Arabic speaking friends. Have an amazing week!
2024-04-29T10:50:47Z	(#wz6g4fa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> you know, wives will always find something they don’t like. I think they did a good job. Wish it was cheaper, but considering the have to redo walls, tiles (floor and shower walls), relocate drain, and water lines, do new floor boards, painting, new cabinets, new toilet, new lights. I mean, it was truly an entire remodeling. Worth it.
2024-04-29T11:56:18Z	(#4b5wi3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> LOL. A landing "page" with just an image (animated GIF), nothing further. Hopefully that's not what @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> has in mind!
2024-04-29T12:38:21Z	(#usfy23q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is a matter of taste. I see Bulma as more complete.
2024-04-29T13:11:33Z	(#usfy23q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> right. It has the neat visual appeal (without going too much overboard), that could make a remake of Yarn UI better looking. For what I can see it is most feature rich, but haven't compared them both in excruciating details to be absolutely sure.  That is not to say that Picnic CSS is bad, nor that I don't like it. In a level of being decently simple, they both are. Bulma just comes across as more polished, that's all.
2024-04-29T13:24:53Z	(#paebb5a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> while mentioning Mastodon simpler alternatives, I think [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/) is worth one. :-)
2024-04-29T13:34:37Z	(#paebb5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> oh, I get that. I look at it this way: I prefer email, but I still get snail mail. Each has its use, right?
2024-04-29T14:07:41Z	(#cnnnquq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I understand, yes. JSON files are easier to manipulate with readily available tools. When I used GTS (not anymore, I run Mastodon because I didn't want to have to wait for client APIs to catch up), I had it with SQLite configured. It was only one file, and I could manipulate it nicely with a bit of SQL knowledge.
2024-04-30T00:47:18Z	(#jgcmfzq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, this is spam.
2024-04-30T10:56:04Z	Today I learned about “eierschalensollbruchstellenverursacher”, and one is coming my way from Amazon. 😂
2024-04-30T12:29:48Z	Having slept for only 2 hours, I truly feel like, well, someone who has only slept 2 hours. 🤭 Can't wait for lunch time to take a small nap.
2024-04-30T13:19:02Z	(#hjcroaa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I love it! Wish there were words like those in English! 🤣
2024-04-30T19:48:35Z	(#gfajzzq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I feel blessed already! :-P
2024-05-01T12:00:27Z	(#js2jumq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and by "y'all" you meant *eapl*, right?  I noticed that too, and LOLed IRL. 🤣
2024-05-01T12:06:17Z	(#7ovrseq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> fear not! We know we are animals that do things on cycles. We also copy each other. What's old becomes new, over and over. It is bound to end... eventually.  I am not fond of it either.
2024-05-01T12:08:09Z	(#jbarl5q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> "looking forward to the *next* weekend"; I see what you did there! :-D
2024-05-01T12:09:21Z	(#i3zmgbq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> standing up Mastodon isn't that much complicated. It is just a little bit more demanding than Yarn, that's all.
2024-05-01T12:28:25Z	(#bq4giva) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> you wrote: > I don’t use Yarn/Twtxt.net anymore, although I read the homepage a few times a week to catchup on anything interesting.  Then you **do** use it, no? Right? :-D  > I barely twt from my PHP instance.  Because PHP sucks! See what I did? I am "encouraging" engagement! :-D  > ... it’s too superficial to have a meaningful conversation.  Microblogging is often the antithesis of meaningful. You talk about everything, and anything you want. Even to the void. You have done it!  Yarn is niche. With it's forks, and yarns, it comes across as a "weird" microblogging for some (weird was the word a friend from Philippines used to refer to Yarn). The UI/UX has issues (I am not an expert, but I would say copying "the others" and slightly adjusting to give Yarn it's own uniqueness should work), and that keeps people away. The cache blows, I want to be able to see everything, at all times. The built-in search blows, I want a more "ala Google" kind of search. There is more, but you get the gist.
2024-05-01T13:10:11Z	(#tolmmcq) Now, don't misunderstand me. With all the perceived drawbacks/flaws I listed, Yarn works. Could it be much better? For sure. *But* it works. :-D
2024-05-01T13:16:53Z	(#7qa4pfq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think it happens more, and more, while on mobile. I use iCloud Private Relay, if that helps.
2024-05-01T16:31:16Z	(#ugqa7ra) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> LOL. That's pretty much it, and it just means "extraordinary". 🤣

2024-05-01T17:36:40Z	(#ugqa7ra) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> hahahahaha! Good findings. Yes, most of them are invented, and medical/drug related. The kick with the German ones is that they summarise an entire paragraph, with not just meaning, but also feelings, and--hypothetically--hard to describe extra meanings rather difficult or impossible to translate to other languages.
2024-05-01T19:06:56Z	Is there something simpler, and leaner, than Gitea, which will allow me to see (as in read only) git repositories nicely on a web browser? Preferably a one-file-only solution, written in Golang.
2024-05-01T22:46:52Z	(#vkzv6na) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> mind it, English is my second language, though I have been using it since 1992, almost constantly.  "Next weekend", is the weekend after the one coming up. The one coming up is "this weekend", or simply "the weekend" (as in, "see you this weekend!" or "will mow the lawn on the weekend"). I don't like the perceived ambiguity of it, thus I strictly use dates ("lets get together on Saturday, 4 May 2024"). 😅
2024-05-01T22:54:12Z	(#s7mxfxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ooooohhh! I like *Legit* quite a bit. "Oui, il est le git!" :-D Thanks!
2024-05-01T22:55:21Z	(#7zepcma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't see how OP will see the replies. Does Yarn proxies to Gemini?
2024-05-01T23:11:59Z	(#ecjdckq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I remember when I first ran Yarn on *arrakis*, it was a mess. Remember I had to start it again from scratch? If I were to run Yarn today, I will have to ask you what `-u`  to use, if I am going to run a web server on it (say, *Caddy*), and what to do to keep the huge cache Xuu and I like. LOL. Granted, I could figure it out myself after some trial and error too.  To make Yarn install easier? An installer script that would prompt for the settings, generate config, and install the *systemd*, because, whether we like it or not, the biggest Linux distros around use it.
2024-05-02T01:01:29Z	(#zljlycq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> that’s some service!
