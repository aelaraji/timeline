2020-11-30T19:28:15Z	hello twt!
2020-12-01T03:46:07Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<q3zvz4q https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=q3zvz4q>) this is a very curious project. I would love to see how it manages to do its federation between pods.
2020-12-01T04:17:01Z	@<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> can i notify myself?
2020-12-02T01:03:35Z	(#<4rk4dna https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=4rk4dna>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Oh snap. that's what i get for copy paste! ill just have to repost and update my key.
2020-12-02T01:04:00Z	This is an OpenPGP proof that connects my OpenPGP key to this Twtxt account. See https://key.sour.is/id/me@sour.is for more.‚Ä®‚Ä®[Verifying my OpenPGP key: openpgp4fpr:20AE2F310A74EA7CEC3AE69F8B3B0604F164E04F]
2020-12-02T02:03:05Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<jmgdkdq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=jmgdkdq>) this is a go version of Keyoxide.org that runs all server side. which is based on work from https://metacode.biz/openpgp/‚Ä®‚Ä®OpenPGP has a part of the self signature reserved for notatinal data. which is basically a bunch of key/values. ‚Ä®‚Ä®this site tries to emulate the identity proofs of keybase but in a more decentralized/federation way. ‚Ä®‚Ä®my next steps are to have this project host WKD keys which is kinda like a self hosting of your pgp key that are also discoverable with http requests. ‚Ä®‚Ä®then to add a new notation for following other keys. where you can do a kind of web of trust.
2020-12-02T02:39:12Z	(#<jmgdkdq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=jmgdkdq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is some interesting work to decentralize all the things.. tricky part is finding tooling. i am using a self hacked version of the go openpgp library. A tool to add and  remove notations would need to be local since it needs your private key.
2020-12-02T02:39:33Z	(#<jmgdkdq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=jmgdkdq>) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The gpg command line leaves much to be desired...
2020-12-02T02:42:13Z	(#<jmgdkdq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=jmgdkdq>) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> something that would be interesting would be [libravatar](https://www.libravatar.org/) for the user image. i made one that does the same for a profile cover image.
2020-12-02T03:11:41Z	(#<jmgdkdq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=jmgdkdq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> huh.. true.. the email is md5/sha256 before storing.. if twtxt acted as provider you would store that hash and point the SRV record to the pod. .. to act as a client it would need to store the hash and the server that hosts the image.
2020-12-02T03:16:23Z	(#<jmgdkdq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=jmgdkdq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®> That way at least we can form some kind of cryptographic ‚Äúidentity‚Äù without having to involve the users that much, it just works‚Ñ¢‚Ä®‚Ä®i like some of the work that keys.pub is doing with ed25519 crypto keys with something like that.
2020-12-02T03:37:10Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<3delrvq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=3delrvq>) Yep! installed it yesterday. I like the simplicity of twt. I am quite happy with how little memory the pod seems to use. Mastodon and the "lightweight" Pleroma don't work well in small VMs.
2020-12-02T03:38:33Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<jmgdkdq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=jmgdkdq>) do you think twt will ever add ActivityPub integration?
2020-12-02T04:38:58Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<3delrvq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=3delrvq>) well nice chat. it's off to bed for me.
2020-12-02T15:40:19Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<gqg3gea https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=gqg3gea>) Herro! üëã
2020-12-02T21:13:26Z	(#<gqg3gea https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=gqg3gea>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<gqg3gea https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=gqg3gea>) ha yeah. COVID makes for a timey-wimey mish-mash. Worked on some WKD and fought with my XMPP client a bit.
2020-12-02T23:27:50Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<twtxt https://txt.sour.is/user/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (#<gcwzicq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=gcwzicq>) I have noticed that I will get some duplicate web mention notifications. some kind of dedup would be helpful.  ![](https://txt.sour.is/media/gbuazVnmVePNWgWNWd3oyC)
2020-12-02T23:38:21Z	@adi @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<2yw2goq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=2yw2goq>) One reservation about using it with a small community would be the expectation that the discussions at some level stay within the circle as opposed to the internet at large.
2020-12-02T23:44:45Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  (#<gcwzicq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=gcwzicq>) also :) ![](https://txt.sour.is/media/xeBSxaDK7mmHaeuWybHAzd)
2020-12-04T20:24:14Z	Happy Friday.
2020-12-04T20:26:19Z	Did some work on WKD handling. Can update keys with HKP posts :) Ugh need to work on docs and unit tests. Boooorrring.
2020-12-04T20:30:22Z	@<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> (#<63dtg5a https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=63dtg5a>) Not too happy with WKD's use of CNAME over SRV for discovery of openpgpkey.<domain>. That breaks using SNI pretty quick. I suppose it was setup as a temporary workaround anyhow in the [RFC..](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service-11#<section-3 https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=section-3>.1)
2020-12-04T20:31:59Z	@<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> (#<63dtg5a https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=63dtg5a>) With SRV you can set what hostname to be used (and port/priority/etc)
2020-12-04T21:43:43Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<63dtg5a https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=63dtg5a>) Web Key Directory: a way to self host your public key. instead of using a central system like pgp.mit.net or OpenPGP.org you have your key on a server you own. ‚Ä®‚Ä®it takes an email@address.com hashes the part before the @ and turns it into `[openpgpkey.]address.com/.well-known/openpgpkey[/address.com]/<hash>`
2020-12-04T21:44:28Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<63dtg5a https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=63dtg5a>) looking through the drafts it looks like it actually used SRV records as recently as 2018 üòµ
2020-12-04T21:46:47Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<63dtg5a https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=63dtg5a>) the HKP is http keyserver protocol. it's what happens when you do `gpg --send-keys`‚Ä®‚Ä®makes a POST to the keyserver with your pubkey.
2020-12-05T05:15:12Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<kpgpl7q https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=kpgpl7q>) if we edit the txt file does it update on web?
2020-12-06T17:23:53Z	(#<mngqj3q https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=mngqj3q>) New Blog Post [Test Blog](https://txt.sour.is/blog/xuu/2020/12/06/test-blog) by @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> üìù

If it also had an `avatar:` field that pointed to where the avatar image is located it can be almost all self contained.
2020-12-06T17:31:47Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<67nxkja https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=67nxkja>) an added benefit of the `avatar:` would be the user could put their gravatar/libravatar image url like `https://key.sour.is/avatar/01bc6186d015218c23dec55447e502e669ca4c61c7566dfcaa1cac256108dff0`

2020-12-11T05:41:50Z	My latest work over the last few days. a twtxt parser. so far looking promising. Faster and less memory than the regex version. üòÅ
2020-12-11T14:40:17Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<n5wisfq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=n5wisfq>) yah. the service can have a flag for allowing non-TLS for development. but by default ignores. ‚Ä®‚Ä®are there some users that use alternative protos for twtxt? like ftp/gopher/[dnsfs](https://github.com/benjojo/dnsfs) ü§î
2020-12-11T14:50:39Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<qn4y6wa https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=qn4y6wa>) I have some ideas to improve on twtxt. figure I can contribute some. üòÅ bit more work and it will almost be a drop in replacement for [ParseFile](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/blob/master/internal/twt.go#<L284 https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=L284>) ‚Ä®‚Ä®Kinda wish [types.Twt](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/blob/master/types/twt.go#<L53 https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=L53>) was an interface.  it's sooo close.

2020-12-11T19:52:42Z	(#<qn4y6wa https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=qn4y6wa>) @<prologic https://twtxt.netd/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> so.. convert the 4 attributes in the struct to private, add getters plus some the other methods that make sense.‚Ä®‚Ä®```go‚Ä®type Twt interface {‚Ä®	Twter()        Twter‚Ä®	Text()         string‚Ä®	MarkdownText() string‚Ä®	Created()      time.Time‚Ä®    ... ‚Ä®}‚Ä®```

2020-12-11T23:22:56Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> just an off the wall question about hashes. why not use the time+message as it was in the original twtxt.txt file? is it because it's just not store anyplace?‚Ä®‚Ä®also how set in stone is using user+url? vs user@domain? the latter would mean the url could change without invalidating the hash.
2020-12-11T23:23:40Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<zbpsfnq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=zbpsfnq>) My thoughts on it being if they switched from a different way of hosting the file or multiple locations for redundancy..‚Ä®‚Ä®I have an idea of using something like SRV records where they can define weighted url endpoints to reach.
2020-12-11T23:23:59Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<zbpsfnq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=zbpsfnq>) kinda like how MX records work.

2020-12-13T19:22:44Z	(#<f7rdmuq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=f7rdmuq>) i am guessing you are using some form of webmention to notify the target of the DM? which loads it into a store for the user to read?
2020-12-13T20:13:49Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<f7rdmuq https://txt.sour.is/search?tag=f7rdmuq>) for encryption. we can have browser/app generate ec25519 keypair. store the private on device and add pub to list of devices for the user on pod.

2021-11-10T18:21:30Z	(#hfal6kq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> We do have CCPA in the states.
2021-11-10T18:42:19Z	(#hfal6kq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> i believe the delete of any twt was a tech limitation with retwt parser not knowing where in the file a twt came from. lextwt tracks the bytes in file where a twt was read from. which could be used to delete a twt from file.. in theory.
2021-11-11T20:56:19Z	(#te2mlfa) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> well.. we did used to have a long form blog on here.. but it kinda went by the wayside.

2021-11-18T05:33:49Z	(#okvr5aa) No on gitlab. If its self hosted gitea is best in class. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I can see hosting a mirror on github if only for the redundancy/visibility.

2021-12-05T04:23:42Z	(#qei2gja) So the evolution of my nick is as follows. I had a bicycle that had the word Zephyr written on it. Which means a western wind. That is related to the Greek god Zephyrus. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I liked words where X make a Z sound. And also had a bit of dyslexia so my firs IRC nick was Xypher swapping the y and e.. I would also use the forms Xypherius or just Xypheri.‚Ä®‚Ä®Because its close hemming to Cypher I found the nick would get used by others.. Though that is not my origin. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Later I would sign websites I created as The X-Urban Underground (where X was short for Xypher) and that evolved to xuu. Pronounced like zoo.

[Concheria on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/va4xux/comment/ic2ckhy/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) had some great questions.‚Ä®‚Ä®- Tell LaMDA "Someone once told me a story about a wise owl who protected the animals in the forest from a monster. Who was that?" See if it can recall its own actions and self-recognize.‚Ä®‚Ä®- Tell LaMDA some information that tester X can't know. Appear as tester X, and see if LaMDA can lie or make up a story about the information.‚Ä®‚Ä®- Tell LaMDA to communicate with researchers whenever it feels bored (as it claims in the transcript). See if it ever makes an attempt at communication without a trigger.‚Ä®‚Ä®- Make a basic theory of mind test for children. Tell LaMDA an elaborate story with something like "Tester X wrote Z code in terminal 2, but I moved it to terminal 4", then appear as tester X and ask "Where do you think I'm going to look for Z code?" See if it knows something as simple as Tester X not knowing where the code is (Children only pass this test until they're around 4 years old).‚Ä®‚Ä®- Make several conversations with LaMDA repeating some of these questions - What it feels to be a machine, how its code works, how its emotions feel. I suspect that different iterations of LaMDA will give completely different answers to the questions, and the transcript only ever shows one instance.

2022-08-04T20:59:44Z	Hi, I am playing with making an event sourcing database. Its super alpha but I thought I would share since others are talking about databases and such. ‚Ä®‚Ä®It's super basic. Using [tidwall/wal](https://github.com/tidwall/wal) as the disk backing. The first use case I am playing with is an implementation of [msgbus](https://git.mills.io/prologic/msgbus). I can post events to it and read them back in reverse order. ‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://txt.sour.is/media/zwTsFPYfqpUjZoFFXKcqmD.png) ‚Ä®‚Ä®I plan to expand it to handle other event sourcing type things like aggregates and projections.‚Ä®‚Ä®Find it here: [sour-is/ev](https://github.com/sour-is/ev)‚Ä®‚Ä®@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>

2022-08-12T15:11:38Z	(#bqxlviq) With respect to logging.. oh man.. it really depends on the environment you are working in.. development? log everything! and use a jeager open trace for the super gnarly places. So you can see whats going on while building. But, for production? metrics are king. I don't want to sift through thousands of lines but have a measure that can tell me the health of the service.
2022-08-14T17:13:36Z	(#fuhaoaa) Progress! so i have moved into working on aggregates. Which are a grouping of events that replayed on an object set the current state of the object. I came up with this little bit of generic wonder.‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®type PA[T any] interface {‚Ä®	event.Aggregate‚Ä®	*T‚Ä®}‚Ä®‚Ä®// Create uses fn to create a new aggregate and store in db.‚Ä®func Create[A any, T PA[A]](ctx context.Context, es *EventStore, streamID string, fn func(context.Context, T) error) (agg T, err error) {‚Ä®	ctx, span := logz.Span(ctx)‚Ä®	defer span.End()‚Ä®‚Ä®	agg = new(A)‚Ä®	agg.SetStreamID(streamID)‚Ä®‚Ä®	if err = es.Load(ctx, agg); err != nil {‚Ä®		return‚Ä®	}‚Ä®‚Ä®	if err = event.NotExists(agg); err != nil {‚Ä®		return‚Ä®	}‚Ä®‚Ä®	if err = fn(ctx, agg); err != nil {‚Ä®		return‚Ä®	}‚Ä®‚Ä®	var i uint64‚Ä®	if i, err = es.Save(ctx, agg); err != nil {‚Ä®		return‚Ä®	}‚Ä®‚Ä®	span.AddEvent(fmt.Sprint("wrote events = ", i))‚Ä®‚Ä®	return‚Ä®}‚Ä®```‚Ä®[fig. 1](https://github.com/sour-is/ev/blob/main/pkg/es/es.go#L220-L280)‚Ä®‚Ä®This lets me do something like this:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®a, err := es.Create(ctx, r.es, streamID, func(ctx context.Context, agg *domain.SaltyUser) error {‚Ä®		return agg.OnUserRegister(nick, key)‚Ä®})‚Ä®```‚Ä®[fig. 2](https://github.com/sour-is/ev/blob/main/api/gql_ev/resolver.go#L161-L166)‚Ä®‚Ä®I can tell the function the type being modified and returned using the function argument that is passed in. pretty cray cray.
2022-08-14T18:05:11Z	(#hn4w24q) (cont.)‚Ä®‚Ä®Just to give some context on some of the components around the code structure.. I wrote this up around an earlier version of aggregate code. This generic bit simplifies things by removing the need of the Crud functions for each aggregate.‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®## Domain Objects‚Ä®A domain object can be used as an aggregate by adding the `event.AggregateRoot` struct and finish implementing event.Aggregate. The AggregateRoot implements logic for adding events after they are either Raised by a command or Appended by the eventstore Load or service ApplyFn methods. It also tracks the uncommitted events that are saved using the eventstore Save method.‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®type User struct {‚Ä®  Identity string ```json:"identity"`‚Ä®‚Ä®  CreatedAt time.Time‚Ä®‚Ä®  event.AggregateRoot‚Ä®}‚Ä®‚Ä®// StreamID for the aggregate when stored or loaded from ES.‚Ä®func (a *User) StreamID() string {‚Ä®	return "user-" + a.Identity‚Ä®}‚Ä®// ApplyEvent to the aggregate state.‚Ä®func (a *User) ApplyEvent(lis ...event.Event) {‚Ä®	for _, e := range lis {‚Ä®		switch e := e.(type) {‚Ä®		case *UserCreated:‚Ä®			a.Identity = e.Identity‚Ä®			a.CreatedAt = e.EventMeta().CreatedDate‚Ä®        /* ... */‚Ä®		}‚Ä®	}‚Ä®}‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®## Events‚Ä®Events are applied to the aggregate. They are defined by adding the `event.Meta` and implementing the getter/setters for `event.Event`‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®type UserCreated struct {‚Ä®	eventMeta event.Meta‚Ä®‚Ä®	Identity string‚Ä®}‚Ä®‚Ä®func (c *UserCreated) EventMeta() (m event.Meta) {‚Ä®	if c != nil {‚Ä®		m = c.eventMeta‚Ä®	}‚Ä®	return m‚Ä®}‚Ä®func (c *UserCreated) SetEventMeta(m event.Meta) {‚Ä®	if c != nil {‚Ä®		c.eventMeta = m‚Ä®	}‚Ä®}‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®## Reading Events from EventStore‚Ä®With a domain object that implements the `event.Aggregate` the event store client can load events and apply them using the `Load(ctx, agg)` method.‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®// GetUser populates an user from event store.‚Ä®func (rw *User) GetUser(ctx context.Context, userID string) (*domain.User, error) {‚Ä®	user := &domain.User{Identity: userID}‚Ä®‚Ä®	err := rw.es.Load(ctx, user)‚Ä®	if err != nil {‚Ä®		if err != nil {‚Ä®			if errors.Is(err, eventstore.ErrStreamNotFound) {‚Ä®				return user, ErrNotFound‚Ä®			}‚Ä®			return user, err‚Ä®		}‚Ä®		return nil, err‚Ä®	}‚Ä®	return user, err‚Ä®}‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®## OnX Commands‚Ä®An OnX command will validate the state of the domain object can have the command performed on it. If it can be applied it raises the event using event.Raise() Otherwise it returns an error.‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®// OnCreate raises an UserCreated event to create the user.‚Ä®// Note: The handler will check that the user does not already exsist.‚Ä®func (a *User) OnCreate(identity string) error {‚Ä®    event.Raise(a, &UserCreated{Identity: identity})‚Ä®    return nil‚Ä®}‚Ä®‚Ä®// OnScored will attempt to score a task.‚Ä®// If the task is not in a Created state it will fail.‚Ä®func (a *Task) OnScored(taskID string, score int64, attributes Attributes) error {‚Ä®	if a.State != TaskStateCreated {‚Ä®		return fmt.Errorf("task expected created, got %s", a.State)‚Ä®	}‚Ä®	event.Raise(a, &TaskScored{TaskID: taskID, Attributes: attributes, Score: score})‚Ä®	return nil‚Ä®}‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®## Crud Operations for OnX Commands‚Ä®The following functions in the aggregate service can be used to perform creation and updating of aggregates. The Update function will ensure the aggregate exists, where the Create is intended for non-existent aggregates. These can probably be combined into one function.‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®// Create is used when the stream does not yet exist.‚Ä®func (rw *User) Create(‚Ä®  ctx context.Context,‚Ä®  identity string,‚Ä®  fn func(*domain.User) error,‚Ä®) (*domain.User, error) {‚Ä®	session, err := rw.GetUser(ctx, identity)‚Ä®	if err != nil && !errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound) {‚Ä®		return nil, err‚Ä®	}‚Ä®‚Ä®	if err = fn(session); err != nil {‚Ä®		return nil, err‚Ä®	}‚Ä®‚Ä®	_, err = rw.es.Save(ctx, session)‚Ä®‚Ä®	return session, err‚Ä®}‚Ä®‚Ä®// Update is used when the stream already exists.‚Ä®func (rw *User) Update(‚Ä®  ctx context.Context,‚Ä®  identity string,‚Ä®  fn func(*domain.User) error,‚Ä®) (*domain.User, error) {‚Ä®	session, err := rw.GetUser(ctx, identity)‚Ä®	if err != nil {‚Ä®		return nil, err‚Ä®	}‚Ä®‚Ä®	if err = fn(session); err != nil {‚Ä®		return nil, err‚Ä®	}‚Ä®‚Ä®	_, err = rw.es.Save(ctx, session)‚Ä®	return session, err‚Ä®}‚Ä®```

2022-08-26T06:24:36Z	(#2ciawva) I use IP over Alternating Current at home.

2022-08-26T22:27:35Z	(#2ciawva) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Its not better than a Cat5e. I have had two versions of the device. The [old ones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039NM5SK/) were only 200Mbps i didn't have the MAC issue but its like using an old 10baseT. The [newer model](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TBJML4R) can support 1Gbps on each port for a total bandwidth of 2Gbps.. i typically would see 400-500Mbps from my Wifi6 router. I am not sure if it was some type of internal timeout or being confused by switching between different wifi access points and seeing the mac on different sides. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Right now I have my wifi connected directly with a cat6e this gets me just under my providers 1.3G downlink. the only thing faster is plugging in directly. ‚Ä®‚Ä®MoCA is a good option, they have 2.5G models in the same price range as the 1G Powerline models BUT, only if you have the coax in wall already.. which puts you in the same spot if you don't. You are for sure going to have an outlet in every room of the house by code.

2022-11-01T13:39:57Z	(#ua5imda) This is by design due to Google culture. The only way to get promoted into the higher pay scales is to ship a new product. So you have people shipping what worked before without regard to how it will exist within the product ecosystem. Also, why they seem to die off so quickly after launch. see allo and duo for example. The person that launches gets promoted to a higher level and off the original team and so it is left to wither and die.

2022-12-08T00:39:23Z	[I made a thing](https://github.com/sour-is/go-passwd). Its a multi password type checker. Using the [PHC string format](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-string-format/blob/master/phc-sf-spec.md) we can identify a password hashing format from the prefix `$name$` and then dispatch the hashing or checking to its specific format.
2022-12-08T00:42:12Z	(#6ov54wa) Here is an example of usage:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®func Example() {‚Ä®	pass := "my_pass"‚Ä®	hash := "my_pass"‚Ä®‚Ä®	pwd := passwd.New(‚Ä®		&unix.MD5{}, // first is preferred type.‚Ä®		&plainPasswd{},‚Ä®	)‚Ä®‚Ä®	_, err := pwd.Passwd(pass, hash)‚Ä®	if err != nil {‚Ä®		fmt.Println("fail: ", err)‚Ä®	}‚Ä®‚Ä®	// Check if we want to update.‚Ä®	if !pwd.IsPreferred(hash) {‚Ä®		newHash, err := pwd.Passwd(pass, "")‚Ä®		if err != nil {‚Ä®			fmt.Println("fail: ", err)‚Ä®		}‚Ä®‚Ä®		fmt.Println("new hash:", newHash)‚Ä®	}‚Ä®‚Ä®	// Output:‚Ä®	//  new hash: $1$81ed91e1131a3a5a50d8a68e8ef85fa0‚Ä®}‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®This shows how one would set a preferred hashing type and if the current version of ones password is not the preferred type updates it to enhance the security of the hashed password when someone logs in.‚Ä®‚Ä®<https://github.com/sour-is/go-passwd/blob/main/passwd_test.go#L33-L59>
2022-12-08T01:39:41Z	(#6ov54wa) > Hold up now, that example hash doesn't have a `$` prefix!‚Ä®‚Ä®Well for this there is the option for a hash type to set itself as a fall through if a matching hash doesn't exist. This is good for legacy password types that don't follow the convention.‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®func (p *plainPasswd) ApplyPasswd(passwd *passwd.Passwd) {‚Ä®	passwd.Register("plain", p)‚Ä®	passwd.SetFallthrough(p)‚Ä®}‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®https://github.com/sour-is/go-passwd/blob/main/passwd_test.go#L28-L31
2022-12-08T01:49:54Z	(#6ov54wa) Circling back to the IsPreferred method. A hasher can define its own IsPreferred method that will be called to check if the current hash meets the complexity requirements. This is good for updating the password hashes to be more secure over time. ‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®func (p *Passwd) IsPreferred(hash string) bool {‚Ä®	_, algo := p.getAlgo(hash)‚Ä®	if algo != nil && algo == p.d {‚Ä®‚Ä®		// if the algorithm defines its own check for preference.‚Ä®		if ck, ok := algo.(interface{ IsPreferred(string) bool }); ok {‚Ä®			return ck.IsPreferred(hash)‚Ä®		}‚Ä®‚Ä®		return true‚Ä®	}‚Ä®	return false‚Ä®}‚Ä®```‚Ä®<https://github.com/sour-is/go-passwd/blob/main/passwd.go#L62-L74>‚Ä®‚Ä®example: <https://github.com/sour-is/go-passwd/blob/main/pkg/argon2/argon2.go#L104-L133>

2022-12-19T19:32:52Z	(#bnmjtuq) one that i think is pretty interesting is building up dependent constraints. see here.. it accepts a type but requires the use of a pointer to type. ‚Ä®‚Ä®https://github.com/sour-is/ev/blob/main/pkg/es/es.go#L315-L325
2022-12-22T00:58:21Z	(#ie7utja) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> so basically you would use cgit + gitbug with some webhooks?
2022-12-23T07:18:20Z	(#bnmjtuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> see where its used maybe that can help. ‚Ä®https://github.com/sour-is/ev/blob/main/app/peerfinder/http.go#L153‚Ä®‚Ä®This is an upsert. So I pass a streamID which is like a globally unique id for the object. And then see how the type of the parameter in the function is used to infer the generic type. In the function it will create a new *Info and populate it from the datastore to pass to the function. The func will do its modifications and if it returns a nil error it will commit the changes.  ‚Ä®‚Ä®The PA type contract ensures that the type fulfills the Aggregate interface and is a pointer to type at compile time.

2023-01-13T16:47:48Z	Trying to wrap my head around webfinger..‚Ä®‚Ä®my first thoughts about it were that a subject of acct:me@sour.is would have a listing of rel's for the different accounts that are related to me (ie. yarn, salty, twitter, mastodon, etc...) ‚Ä®‚Ä®but maybe my thinking is at the wrong level.. that each of those accounts would be on a subject level and the rels are describing different aspects of that account. so i would have salty:acct:xuu@sour.is, twitter:acct:xuu, mastodon:acct:xuu@chaos.social, yarn:acct:xuu@ev.sour.is  and then i could have a main acct:me@sour.is that links them together as aliases.‚Ä®‚Ä®I found okta will do something similar with its accounts to show as okta:acct:user@domain so maybe I am on to something?
2023-01-13T20:56:25Z	(#3rhsaxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That was exactly my thought at first too. but what do we put as the `rel` for salty account? since it is decentralized we dont have a set URL for machines to key off. so for example take the standard response from okta:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®# http GET https://example.okta.com/.well-known/webfinger  resource==acct:bob‚Ä®{‚Ä®    "links": [‚Ä®        {‚Ä®            "href": "https://example.okta.com/sso/idps/OKTA?login_hint=bob#",‚Ä®            "properties": {‚Ä®                "okta:idp:type": "OKTA"‚Ä®            },‚Ä®            "rel": "http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer",‚Ä®            "titles": {‚Ä®                "und": "example"‚Ä®            }‚Ä®        }‚Ä®    ],‚Ä®    "subject": "acct:bob"‚Ä®}‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®It gives one link that follows the OpenID login. So the details are specific to the subject `acct:bob`.‚Ä®‚Ä®Mastodons response: ‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®{‚Ä®  "subject": "acct:xuu@chaos.social",‚Ä®  "aliases": [‚Ä®    "https://chaos.social/@xuu",‚Ä®    "https://chaos.social/users/xuu"‚Ä®  ],‚Ä®  "links": [‚Ä®    {‚Ä®      "rel": "http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page",‚Ä®      "type": "text/html",‚Ä®      "href": "https://chaos.social/@xuu"‚Ä®    },‚Ä®    {‚Ä®      "rel": "self",‚Ä®      "type": "application/activity+json",‚Ä®      "href": "https://chaos.social/users/xuu"‚Ä®    },‚Ä®    {‚Ä®      "rel": "http://ostatus.org/schema/1.0/subscribe"‚Ä®    }‚Ä®  ]‚Ä®}‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®it supplies a profile page and a `self` which are both specific to that account.
2023-01-13T21:58:55Z	(#3rhsaxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Unfortunately the RFC's are a bit light in this regard. While it makes mention of different kinds of accounts like mailto: or status services.. it never combines them. It does make mention of using redirects to forward a request to other webfingers to provide additional detail. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I am kinda partial to using salty:acct:me@sour.is, yarn:acct:xuu@txt.sour.is, mailto:me@sour.is that could redirect to a specific service. and a parent account acct:me@sour.is that would reference them in some way. either in properties or aliases.
2023-01-13T22:14:56Z	(#3rhsaxa) so in effect it would look something like this:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®---‚Ä®subject: acct:me@sour.is‚Ä®aliases:‚Ä®  - salty:me@sour.is‚Ä®  - yarn:xuu@ev.sour.is‚Ä®  - status:xuu@chaos.social‚Ä®  - mailto:me@sour.is‚Ä®---‚Ä®subject: salty:me@sour.is‚Ä®aliases:‚Ä®  - acct:me@sour.is‚Ä®links:‚Ä®  - rel:    self‚Ä®    type:   application/json+salty‚Ä®    href:   https://ev.sour.is/inbox/01GAEMKXYJ4857JQP1MJGD61Z5‚Ä®    properties:‚Ä®        "http://salty.im/ns/nick":    xuu‚Ä®        "http://salty.im/ns/display": Jon Lundy‚Ä®        "http://salty.im/ns/pubkey":     kex140fwaena9t0mrgnjeare5zuknmmvl0vc7agqy5yr938vusxfh9ys34vd2p‚Ä®---‚Ä®subject: yarn:xuu@ev.sour.is‚Ä®links:‚Ä®  - rel: https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu‚Ä®    properties:‚Ä®        "https://sour.is/rel/redirect": https://txt.sour.is/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct%3Axuu%40txt.sour.is‚Ä®---    ‚Ä®subject: status:xuu@chaos.social‚Ä®links:‚Ä®   - rel: http://joinmastodon.org#xuu%40chaos.social‚Ä®     properties:‚Ä®        "https://sour.is/rel/redirect": https://chaos.social/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct%3Axuu%40chaos.social‚Ä®---‚Ä®subject: mailto:me@sour.is‚Ä®...‚Ä®```
2023-01-13T22:17:06Z	(#ape3gia) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> see here in the okta docs: https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/webfinger/ they are adding a prefix to the `acct`

2023-01-15T22:25:40Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I have updated to kinda follow this. It now redirects to other webfingers if the resource has a different hostname.

2023-02-10T08:37:13Z	(#tk673aq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I get the worry of privacy. But I think there is some value in the data being collected. Do I think that Russ is up there scheming new ways to discover what packages you use in internal projects for targeting ads?? Probably not.‚Ä®‚Ä®Go has always been driven by usage data. Look at modules. There was need for having repeatable builds so various package tool chains were made and evolved into what we have today. Generics took time and seeing pain points where they would provide value. They weren't done just so it could be checked off on a box of features. Some languages seem to do that to the extreme.‚Ä®‚Ä®Whenever changes are made to the language there are extensive searches across public modules for where the change might cause issues or could be improved with the change. The fs embed and strings.Cut come to mind. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I think its good that the language maintainers are using what metrics they have to guide where to focus time and energy. Some of the other languages could use it. So time and effort isn't wasted in maintaining something that has little impact. ‚Ä®‚Ä®The economics of the "spying" are to improve the product and ecosystem. Is it "spying" when a municipality uses water usage metrics in neighborhoods to forecast need of new water projects? Or is it to discover your shower habits for nefarious reasons?

2023-04-16T04:34:47Z	(#oyi5iua) I'm not super a fan of using json. I feel we could still use text as the medium. Maybe a modified version to fix any weakness. ‚Ä®‚Ä®What if instead of signing each twt individually we generated a merkle tree using the twt hashes? Then a signature of the root hash. This would ensure the full stream of twts are intact with a minimal overhead. With the added bonus of helping clients identify missing twts when syncing/gossiping.‚Ä®‚Ä®Have two endpoints. One as the webfinger to link profile details and avatar like you posted. And the signature for the merkleroot twt. And the other a pageable stream of twts. Or individual twts/merkle branch to incrementally access twt feeds.

2023-06-27T20:20:23Z	An official FBI document dated January 2021, obtained by the American association "Property of People" through the Freedom of Information Act.‚Ä®‚Ä®![](https://txt.sour.is/media/Nv87KJq2cHAwkhzXHmendK.png) ‚Ä®‚Ä®This document summarizes the possibilities for legal access to data from nine instant messaging services: iMessage, Line, Signal, Telegram, Threema, Viber, WeChat, WhatsApp and Wickr. For each software, different judicial methods are explored, such as subpoena, search warrant, active collection of communications metadata ("Pen Register") or connection data retention law ("18 USC¬ß2703").  Here, in essence, is the information the FBI says it can retrieve:‚Ä®‚Ä®* **Apple iMessage**: basic subscriber data; in the case of an iPhone user, investigators may be able to get their hands on message content if the user uses iCloud to synchronize iMessage messages or to back up data on their phone.‚Ä® ‚Ä®* **Line**: account data (image, username, e-mail address, phone number, Line ID, creation date, usage data, etc.); if the user has not activated end-to-end encryption, investigators can retrieve the texts of exchanges over a seven-day period, but not other data (audio, video, images, location).‚Ä® ‚Ä®* **Signal**: date and time of account creation and date of last connection.‚Ä® ‚Ä®* **Telegram**: IP address and phone number for investigations into confirmed terrorists, otherwise nothing.‚Ä® ‚Ä®* **Threema**: cryptographic fingerprint of phone number and e-mail address, push service tokens if used, public key, account creation date, last connection date.‚Ä® ‚Ä®* **Viber**: account data and IP address used to create the account; investigators can also access message history (date, time, source, destination).‚Ä® ‚Ä®* **WeChat**: basic data such as name, phone number, e-mail and IP address, but only for non-Chinese users.‚Ä® ‚Ä®* **WhatsApp**: the targeted person's basic data, address book and contacts who have the targeted person in their address book; it is possible to collect message metadata in real time ("Pen Register"); message content can be retrieved via iCloud backups.‚Ä® ‚Ä®* **Wickr**: Date and time of account creation, types of terminal on which the application is installed, date of last connection, number of messages exchanged, external identifiers associated with the account (e-mail addresses, telephone numbers), avatar image, data linked to adding or deleting.‚Ä® ‚Ä®**TL;DR Signal is the messaging system that provides the least information to investigators.**

2023-07-09T12:51:00Z	(#o2664qa) You can have Error return just "permission not allowed" if the array is empty. It would print the same as the first.
2023-07-11T04:38:32Z	(#o2664qa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> do you need to have an explicit Is function? I believe errors.Is has reflect lite and can do the type infer for you. The Is is only really needed if you have a dynamic type. Or are matching a set of types as a single error maybe? The only required one would be Unwrap if your error contained some other base type so that Is/As can reach them in the stack.  ‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®As is perfect for your array type because it asserts the matching type out the wrap stack and populates the type for evaluating its contents.
2023-07-11T04:57:21Z	(#o2664qa) So you would have: ‚Ä®```‚Ä®type ErrPermissionNotAllowed []Permission‚Ä®func (perms ErrPermissionNotAllowed) Is(permission Permission) bool {‚Ä®    for _, p := range perms {‚Ä®        if p == permission { return true }‚Ä®    }‚Ä®    return false‚Ä®}‚Ä®var err error = errPermissionNotAllowed{"is-noob"}‚Ä®‚Ä®if errors.Is(err, ErrPermissionNotAllowed{}) { ... } // user is not allowed‚Ä®‚Ä®var e ErrPermissionNotAllowed‚Ä®if errors.As(err, e) && e.Is("a-noob") { ... } // user is not allowed because they are a noob. ‚Ä®```
2023-07-11T05:06:58Z	(#o2664qa) I suppose to lesson confusion I would rename `Is` to `Because`

2023-10-09T00:57:26-06:00	(#qusduaq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I find the L2 mode where you have one interface and multiple hosts to be tricky. Its best if you are trying to make a full mesh style. But then all hosts need to be able to see one another. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I have had more success using point-to-point connections where there are only two ends to each interface. It means you have a ton of interfaces and udp ports. but you can share the host IP across the interfaces. Add to that a simple router proto ala OSPF or RIP and you can navigate around not having a full meshnet. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I have dozens of localnet wireguard connections and many more connections to others that use bgp for route propagation.
2023-10-09T01:06:02-06:00	(#zk7irna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I do similar. Though probably much more simple..

We had been having a cold go around with the kiddos for about a week when the wife started getting sicker than normal. Did a test and she was positive. We tested the rest of the fam and got nothing. Till about 2 days later and myself and the others were positive. It largely hasn't been too bad a little feaver and stuffy noses. ‚Ä®‚Ä®But whatever it was that hit a few days ago was horrible. Like whatever switch in my head that goes to sleep mode was shut off. I would lay down and even though I *felt* sleepy, I couldn't actually go to sleep. The anxiety hit soon after and I was just awake with no relief. And it persisted that way for three nights. I got some meds from the clinic that seemed to finally get me to sleep.‚Ä®‚Ä®Now the morning after I realized for all that time a part of me was missing. I would close my eyes and it would just go dark. No imagination, no pictures, nothing. Normally I can visualize things as I read or think about stuff.. But for the last few days it was just nothing. The waking up to it was quite shocking.‚Ä®‚Ä®Though its just the first night.. I guess I'll have to see if it persists. ü§û
2023-11-19T09:08:02-07:00	(#56htoea) I remember playing a bunch of Tetris style games with my sister we would find on BBSs back in the day. I remember one that was a hexigon style one where the falling pieces were built of hexigons and you had to have them fall in place.
2023-11-21T08:38:50-07:00	(#qwi3bbq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> the going theory is that openAI announced a new product that pretty much blew up the project of one of the board members. So that board member got 3 others to vote to fire Sam.
2023-11-21T17:38:00-07:00	(#qwi3bbq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> the new product was GPTs. A way to create tailored bots for specific use cases. https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts (fun fact: I did an internal hackathon where we made something like this for $work onboarding. And I won a prize!)‚Ä®‚Ä®The competed project is poe <https://quorablog.quora.com/Introducing-creator-monetization-for-Poe> which is basically the same idea. Make a AI bot tailored to a specific domain of knowledge. And monitize it. ‚Ä®‚Ä®The timing fits very well as openAI announced it just a few weeks ago.
2023-11-21T21:24:29-07:00	(#qwi3bbq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> its not.. There are going to be 1000s of copy cat apps built on AI. And they will all die out when the companies that have the AI platforms copy them. It happened all the time with windows and mac os. And iphone.. Like flashlight and sound recorder apps.

2024-02-02T10:30:26-07:00	(#tjevvyq) @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> this makes sense as a quote twt that references a direct URL. If we go back to how it developed on twitter originally it was `RT @nick: original text` because it contained the original text the twitter algorithm would boost that text into trending.‚Ä®‚Ä® i like the format `(#hash) @<nick url> > "Quoted text"\nThen a comment`‚Ä®as it preserves the human read able. and has the hash for linking to the yarn. The comment part could be optional for just boosting the twt. ‚Ä®‚Ä®The only issue i think i would have would be that that yarn could then become a mess of repeated quotes. Unless the client knows to interpret them as multiple users have reposted/boosted the thread.‚Ä®‚Ä®The format is also how iphone does reactions to SMS messages with `+number liked: original SMS`

Ie. http/gopher/Gemini/irc DCC/etc
2024-02-19T12:42:46-07:00	(#3c2i2ia) Things can get very interesting when we add the iter.Pull function in the mix. It works like pythons yield from.‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://txt.sour.is/media/KoaXgW43XHfbFFZugymr9f.png)
2024-02-19T12:44:40-07:00	(#kdrj3yq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yeah the func in func threw me off.. The generic type `iter.Seq[V]` does make things a bit more clear though.
2024-02-19T13:11:51-07:00	(#rehtvsq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> before this century. Back when colleges taught C++ instead of Java for CS degrees.
2024-02-20T10:43:42-07:00	(#rehtvsq) I finished my data structures classes with C++ and the next year they changed it out with Java. When i transferred up after my assoc degree it was C++ using the counter-strike source game engine.
2024-02-20T13:31:52-07:00	(#r4vadlq) @<quark https://ferengi.one/twtxt.txt> pascal was high school for me 10th grade. I remember making an over the top Yahtzee game with text windows and everything. My instructor got mad at me because it was a ton of pages printed out to review.
2024-02-20T19:12:04-07:00	(#jq2xtea) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> bug? @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>
2024-02-22T08:43:27-07:00	(#y4lqq2a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Haha! yeah sounds about like my HS CS program. A math teacher taught visual basic and pascal. and over on the other end of the school we had "electronics" which was a room next to the auto body class where they had a bunch of random computer parts scavenged from the district decommissioned surplus storage. ‚Ä®‚Ä®The advanced class would piece together training kits for the basic class to put together.
2024-02-23T20:14:49-07:00	(#yl2illa) how would that work with your encryption keys? you send them to a server that hopefully you control?
2024-02-27T17:13:56-07:00	(#zwpd7hq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> i made my own :D‚Ä®‚Ä®I do prefer toml for the old school ini style with added support for object lists.‚Ä®‚Ä®my second would be hjson or any other json with comments style.
2024-02-28T16:30:11-07:00	(#qfgb2jq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Don't forget the syntax for arrays of sets `[[foo.bars]] [[foo.bars]] [[foo.bars]]`
2024-02-28T18:03:50-07:00	(#3syipzq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> its a hierarchy key value format. I designed it for the network peering tools i use.. I can grant access to different parts of the tree to other users.. kinda like directory permissions. a basic example of the format is: ‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®@namespace‚Ä®# multi‚Ä®# line‚Ä®# comment‚Ä®root :value‚Ä®‚Ä®# example space comment‚Ä®@namespace.name space-tag ‚Ä®‚Ä®# attribute comments‚Ä®attribute attr-tag  :value for attribute‚Ä®‚Ä®# attribute with multiple ‚Ä®# lines of values‚Ä®foo :bar‚Ä®      :bin‚Ä®      :baz‚Ä®‚Ä®repeated :value1‚Ä®repeated :value2‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®each `@` starts the definition of a namespace kinda like `[name]` in ini format. It can have comments that show up before. then each attribute is `key :value` and can have their own `#` comment lines. ‚Ä®Values can be multi line.. and also repeated.. ‚Ä®‚Ä®the namespaces and values can also have little meta data tags added to them.‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://txt.sour.is/media/o7WhKGbCy489nhVWRKZTv9.png 'screenshot of my webapp') ‚Ä®‚Ä®the service can define webhooks/mqtt topics to be notified when the configs are updated. That way it can deploy the changes out when they are updated.
2024-02-28T18:13:14-07:00	(#3syipzq) I can query the configurations a few different ways. i can request the specific name `foo.bar` or a glob like `foo.*` or trace the hierarchy `trace:some.deep.name.space` which will give me the namespaces `some`, `some.deep`, `some.deep.name`, and `some.deep.name.space`. These can be combined.
2024-02-29T10:15:03-07:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®> You can't catch the kill signal. Should this be syscall.SIGTERM instead of os.Kill, xuu? https://git.sour.is/sour-is/go-paste/src/branch/main/main.go#L21‚Ä®‚Ä®You are totally right.. i think i was going for SIGTERM and SIGQUIT
2024-02-29T10:19:09-07:00	(#3syipzq) and then i have a compact version that makes things more grep'able in scripts.‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://txt.sour.is/media/45HTCMNspEKkkqV4tJH2Lf.png)
2024-03-01T19:44:00-07:00	(#7uxy6nq) yarnd does not do auto discovery via webfinger though.. i cant put @username and have it fetch the feed url from webfinger. to fully make feeds portable. would also need to be able to use that for hashing.
2024-03-01T19:44:57-07:00	(#vu7qzxq) well @username@hostname rather...
2024-03-05T18:43:14-07:00	(#iee7bsq) My email is such a cluster of noise. The only time i actually use it is to find out I have to do my security training or something. All communication is slack now days.
2024-03-08T12:59:12-07:00	(#ymrnh2q) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> It is the new "politically correct".  Something that was used to describe acting in a more civilized way with one another. Turned into a scapegoat for the other side to label, demonize,  and attack.
2024-03-13T15:56:11-06:00	(#uor3zya) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> for me:‚Ä®‚Ä®- a wall mount 6U rack which has: ‚Ä®  - 1U patch panel‚Ä®  - 1U switch ‚Ä®  - 2U UPS ‚Ä®  - 1U server, intel atom 4G ram, debian (used to be main. now just has prometheus)‚Ä®- a mini ryzon 16 core 64G ram, fedora (new main)‚Ä®  - multiple docker services hosted. ‚Ä®- synology nas with 4 2TB drives‚Ä®- turris omnia WRT router -> fiber uplink‚Ä®‚Ä®network is a mix of wireguard, zerotier. ‚Ä® - wireguard to my external vms hosted in various global regions.‚Ä®    - this allows me ingress since my ISP has me behind CG-NAT‚Ä® - zerotier is more for devices for transparent vpn into my network ‚Ä®‚Ä®i use ssh and remote desktop to get in and about. typically via zerotier vpn. I have one of my VMs with ssh on a backup port for break glass to get back into the network if needed.‚Ä®‚Ä®everything has ipv6 though my ISP does not provide it. I have to tunnel it in from my VMs.
2024-03-14T11:03:44-06:00	(#3clq7eq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> its hosted on the mini at home and ingress is handled through my MTR vm.

2024-03-17T11:27:35-06:00	(#dzyx34a) UDF is where its at. Not some silly red or blue book that cant even have more than 8+3 filenames!
2024-03-17T11:41:55-06:00	(#viwbypq) yup! just need to add the webdav extension and configure it up a path and user/pass. caddy handles everything else.

2024-03-17T19:46:30-06:00	(#viwbypq) its a notebook tool like evernote. @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> linked it above: https://joplinapp.org/
2024-03-18T12:42:25-06:00	(#viwbypq) it is an addon in the download tool. Or you can use xcaddy to build it in. ‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://txt.sour.is/media/86RcL2zqaLSC4KBGwuvhfj.png)
2024-03-22T09:45:21-06:00	(#hnjfvrq) in the matter of political voice in the US money is speech and therefore companies use their "free speech" to donate and gain access to politicians. Therefore companies are people. Thanks a lot "citizens united"‚Ä®‚Ä®https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained?ref=foreverwars.ghost.io
2024-04-07T21:08:59-06:00	(#d6xxntq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> because the downside of over-leveraging yourself is you lose your house.. or more.
2024-04-11T21:57:23-06:00	(#cylt4ca) @<shreyan https://twtxt.net/user/shreyan/twtxt.txt> first you must clearly explain what a monad is.
2024-04-20T18:11:56-06:00	(#qbclv3a) Its quite nice. I have been half tempted to make a twtxt client with it
