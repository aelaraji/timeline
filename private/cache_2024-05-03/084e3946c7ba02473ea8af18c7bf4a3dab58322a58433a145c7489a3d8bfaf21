2022-04-17T04:43:09Z	It's official, [yarnpods](https://yarn.yarnpods.com) is officially coming off of apache2 because I've completely fucked the reverse proxying üòÇ Now the question is, is Nginx of Traefik easier to learn?
2022-04-17T04:45:22Z	(#th6zxhq) This will also give me the opportunity to setup the docker-compose file to include yarnd as well as Gitea.
2022-04-17T04:56:26Z	(#th6zxhq) Nevermind, decided Traefik would fit best as I don't necessarily need a web server on my server, this can be handled inside docker.
2022-04-17T09:05:45Z	(#th6zxhq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'll definitely take a look!‚Ä®‚Ä®@<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I'm hoping with Traefik it's only a few things to do in config for the reverse proxy to Docker containers üòÇ Apache unfortunately is a bit...dated‚Ä®‚Ä®Got Traefik working for port 80 and the dashboard on 8080 for now. Will continue this after the little one is in bed
2022-04-17T12:31:17Z	(#th6zxhq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I'm right there with you!‚Ä®‚Ä®@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic> So, I'm guessing a config file may be an easier way to manage all of these?
2022-04-17T13:55:03Z	(#th6zxhq) I think I'm going to need a course on how to correctly define services, routers and just everything Traefik. This is making my brain implode üòÖ
2022-06-08T09:13:09Z	(#wfgf5da) @<carsten http://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> I'm still alive! Yes, I did just move across Australia so I'm still out of action on the migration over to traefik, which hasn't been hugely fun üòÇ
2022-06-13T23:58:24Z	Anyone have any no/low cost cloud providers I can run my Yarn instance on? Thinking it may be a good idea to host it in the cloud rather than on my own hardware, and yes, I would prefer a provider with a good privacy policy.
2022-06-14T00:27:15Z	(#zjsrxoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'll check it out! Sucks they require a credit card linked if you don't want to make a payment üò¨
2022-06-17T09:16:22Z	(#zjsrxoa) @<retrocrash https://twtxt.net/user/retrocrash/twtxt.txt> It was running, but there's no bridge to the internet and it's not updating from the data file. I figure it's better to have a somewhat standard configuration than a unique one.
2022-06-30T04:11:28Z	Haven't been around lately. Here's a photo from the glass elevators at work üòä‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/R2MYQ3pjMaa62mM7oxugYA.png)
2022-07-06T01:49:06Z	(#omsxfeq) @<carsten http://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Close! It's 111 Eagle Street. Photo from level 50
2022-07-06T02:33:08Z	(#omsxfeq) @<ionores https://twtxt.net/user/ionores/twtxt.txt> Not a chance! üòÇ I work to work (an hour+ of walking everyday I'm in the city) and my legs are already pooped by the time I get home üòÖ
2022-07-06T03:00:35Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think this is almost done. Just 1 more responsive size to go (801px-1200px primarily for any size between mobile and desktop but will add more if required).‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/tHTUFzZ3eVb7Ux87dHeC53.png)
2022-07-06T13:06:50Z	(#7ejbduq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I did cave and use XAMPP because I'm just not sharp enough to get zs working, however I have put it in the relevant zs files and linked it to the CSS directory, so it should be very easy to just chuck into a zs environment and work üòÅ
2022-07-06T13:08:22Z	(#7ejbduq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Also, sorry for it taking so long. I should've had this finished way earlier but moving got in the way a lot üòÖ
2022-07-07T12:14:08Z	(#3nr4ekq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ü•≥ congrats! Now to register an account üòâ
2022-07-08T03:26:56Z	(#7ejbduq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> This should be good to go now. I'll pop it up on gitea for you tonight. I'm also happy to continue on with further development and fixes as needed/wanted üòä
2022-07-09T02:31:49Z	(#7ejbduq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> https://git.mills.io/Screem/yarn-docs üòä I feel as more pages are made and more markdown is used, I may need to make changes on the fly. Hopefully this won't need to happen too often. Plus, depending on the structure of the .md files, will need to update the links to direct.
2022-07-13T05:48:21Z	(#x3kam3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Big agree! Microtransactions are eating away at the gaming industry because they have no incentive to make good and innovative games anymore (especially Activision Blizzard with the WoW expansions being lack luster and the same Call of Duty product pushed every year. Don't get me.started on Diablo Immortal). If BMW is successful with microtransactions, I'll be pretty worried about the future of the automotive industry.
2022-07-13T06:06:13Z	(#v6ksn2q) @<win0err https://kolesnikov.se/twtxt.txt> I agree with @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> about the text size. Adding `content="width=device-width"` to your viewport meta tag will help massively with scaling on different device widths.‚Ä®‚Ä®Eg. The first screenshot is the current site with a device width of 440px and the second is with the updated viewport meta tag.‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/GYHVdrVJos792QiKuUNLgT.png)‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/u5NsxbZdW4vYBZrKQZDXhU.png)‚Ä®‚Ä®Other than that, I like the aesthetic of it üòä It gives me early-ish internet vibes, which I wasn't online for (I'm a '90s baby) but I've seen some pretty early websites.
2022-07-14T05:05:24Z	(#aip2mnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I like the Windows 11 UX ü§ê
2022-07-14T05:07:09Z	(#x3kam3q) @<retrocrash https://twtxt.net/user/retrocrash/twtxt.txt> Yes sir! ü§™ Can't wait for a subscription fee for oxygen.
2022-07-14T08:57:21Z	(#zjsrxoa) I've decided on Vultr for the time being. Thank you for your suggestions! Might give GCS a try at some point as well for other misc. things to see how that goes.‚Ä®‚Ä®Now to try and work out how installing this works ü§î
2022-07-14T08:58:38Z	(#aip2mnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I like that they went for a design that hasn't been present on Windows, even though it is more than likely "inspired by" MacOS.
2022-07-14T09:14:53Z	New phone buying season is almost here. The question is get an iPhone to change it up a bit or wait for the Samsung Galaxy Fold4 late this year?! ü§î
2022-07-17T13:13:46Z	(#2o73x6q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> See, I feel that example isn't the best as it has the main features a general user could want in a much smaller, nicer looking and easier to navigate right-click menu. Sure, these things can be annoying in the moment but tbh I'm not really going to let me UX get ruined because of an extra click or two.‚Ä®‚Ä®I do agree that changing default browsers is a tad on the cumbersome side, however I can see instances someone may _want_ to use different browsers for different tasks. Not trying to say this is a usual user activity or that it isn't annoying, but I don't agree with the narrative of Microsoft trying to make things harder to do to keep you in their ecosystem, especially as law makers in the US are a bit more (albeit negligibly so) aware of anti-consumer and anti-competition practices that have been implemented in the industry (eg. EU's requirement for all phones to be USB-C compatible to stop Apple forcing their users to buy a new, over-priced cable if they were to damage the original one)
2022-07-18T09:04:20Z	(#evw75qq) @<retrocrash https://twtxt.net/user/retrocrash/twtxt.txt> Pixels have never interested me tbh, mostly due to the first one being far behind the competition for a flagship smart phone. I'll have a look at grapheneos üòä
2022-07-19T07:29:38Z	(#2o73x6q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I agree with your points and did see that video, however I don't agree with the narrative that Microsoft is making these decision maliciously. If they were making those sorts of decisions to keep you locked into Microsoft only, they wouldn't have redesigned the UI to be slightly more annoying (I barely use the right-click menu daily) and they'd still be soldering on through Windows on mobile and not using Android (cool idea but the ecosystem of apps is lacking and the design was....yeah, it existed for sure).‚Ä®‚Ä®I personally believe Microsoft knows what they're unable to take much market share from companies, such as Google, and are focusing their main efforts into the future of gaming with their cloud gaming services (they function really well) and gamepass. Maybe I'm being naive; if so, I'll gladly admit I was wrong.
2022-07-19T07:38:34Z	(#evw75qq) @<retrocrash https://twtxt.net/user/retrocrash/twtxt.txt> That's fair. I'm very much a fan of lots of features üòÜ‚Ä®‚Ä®@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I've settled on waiting for the iPhone 14 and get the Pro Max. Same with my partner. Just means I'll have to get the AirPods Max as well for a wireless headset. I know, tough life sometimes ü§£
2022-07-19T08:57:23Z	I've been brushing up on some ethical hacking skills lately. Hoping to carry this through to other CTF style activities.‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/n2rtcXQSC62jVvvaPgbR6A.png)
2022-07-25T09:44:20Z	Well, well, well. Look what we have here. Will this make you want to stop using Go now @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>?? ü§î ü§£ (I suspect not)‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/cvkRJurJVp2CKBjnEauTEW.png)
2022-07-25T09:47:24Z	(#yjqj5qa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Oof. Lots of nasty stuff going around (just got over some flu going around, not the real bad one luckily). Hope it's nothing too serious for you!
2022-07-25T13:53:44Z	(#ofvz6ia) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> But...our Google overlords will be very disappointed ü§£
2022-07-26T01:02:54Z	With the uptick in ads being shown on platforms like Twitter, I'd like to petition a name change of these platforms from "social media" to "social marketing". Seems to fit well, I think ü§î üòÇ

2022-08-03T06:09:02Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I may need your help with this whole Vultr `yarnd` install, if you have time over the next few days. Work has picked up again so won't have time during the day ü§£
2022-08-03T09:41:27Z	(#zwvw6aq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sounds like a plan! See you then! üòä
2022-08-06T05:39:31Z	Was only a matter of time before the next Twitter breach.‚Ä®‚Ä®https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/twitter-breach-exposed-anonymous-account-owners-88013236
2022-08-06T05:41:41Z	(#d6xttgq) The part that surprises me is their advice to people running accounts that are supposed to not show their identity is pretty baffling. "Don't use a publicly known email or phone number" seems like a but of a "victim blame" for Twitter accepting risk that has now exposed the information of millions of accounts.
2022-09-19T05:31:07Z	Since it‚Äôs official, I‚Äôm now permanent in my role at work! My probation ended early due to the quality of work and willingness to do anything I‚Äôve been tasked with ü•≥
2022-09-19T06:06:49Z	(#hjpwlnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thanks! A lot of stress off our minds. Now we‚Äôre here to stay in Brisbane for a while üòè
2022-09-19T06:08:51Z	(#moklqra) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> huh, this looks super intriguing to me. I‚Äôd be happy to test this out, so I can sandbox some things on my Rpi (been slacking on that a bit üòÖ)
2022-09-20T02:13:57Z	(#hjpwlnq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> Thank you! Now to catch up on a bit of a knowledge gap! I‚Äôm undertaking my CISSP soon, curtesy of work üòâ
2022-09-21T05:29:41Z	(#hhdseja) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  Wow! You really have one hell of a representative in your area. She‚Äôs a shining example of what most should be. It‚Äôs a similar internet situation in WA, where I was FTTN with 3KMs of copper and paying for 100MBps. I truely feel your pain üòî
2022-09-26T21:32:12Z	For my fellow Australians, I hope none of you use Optus for any ISP services üò¨
2022-09-26T21:35:39Z	(#rfs6lza) If so, keep an eye out on [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) over the coming days. 10,000 records are being released for the next 4 days until Optus pays the extortion fee. I don‚Äôt think this is likely considering they‚Äôve already engaged the AFP (Australian Federal Police).
2022-09-26T21:38:52Z	(#rfs6lza) For those abroad who aren‚Äôt familiar with this, Optus (an ISP) has suffered a data breach. Data that has been exposed are: full name, date of birth, address and potentially government documents such as driver‚Äôs licence, passport and Medicare number (public health care number). There‚Äôs evidence of 55 Medicare numbers being exposed in the first batch of 10,000 records that have been released today.
2022-09-26T22:20:34Z	(#rfs6lza) It‚Äôs rumoured that the attacker(s) were able to access an API that linked to a test environment that didn‚Äôt require authentication. This environment had access to Optus‚Äô production customer databases.
2022-09-27T04:16:41Z	(#rfs6lza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  I‚Äôve been learning very fast that mostly investing further money into the already barebones budget IT/Security is usually seen as a poor Return On Investment. I‚Äôm sure you know from your Facebook days, but even AU companies would rather pay massive fines every 5-10 years than focusing on security. I think part of the issue is the high prices currently put on security solutions but a huge component is compliance > competence.
2022-09-27T04:17:25Z	(#rfs6lza)  also very telling that the old CISO left Optus 3 weeks prior to the breach. Sounds like some very shitty decisions from the top.
2022-09-27T06:41:29Z	Interesting and tough moral dilemma: is it appropriate for Government to strip privacy away from all citizens in favour for the safety of children online to avoid the production and distribution of CSAM? I ask because there‚Äôs a podcast from the Australian Federal Police around CSAM in Australia and there was a statement that effectively the prevention of CSAM needs to take a priority over privacy.
2022-09-27T06:42:54Z	(#zdoe7hq) Persoanlly, I of course want CSAM to be reduced to the point of becoming non-existent, however I do hold the right to privacy, whether exercised or not, very high on my priority list these days. It‚Äôs a tough dilemma for me, that‚Äôs for sure ü§î
2022-09-27T07:03:12Z	(#zdoe7hq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> that‚Äôs a fair point. My thinking is really geared towards children that don‚Äôt have parents that care what happens to them, which is also an entirely different root cause. I‚Äôm still swayed in the same direction as you though
2022-09-27T07:07:01Z	(#zdoe7hq) Also brings up the old point of if they take away our privacy, what else would they be willing to take from us. Seems like a net negative all around to punish the majority over the actions of the minority
2022-09-27T08:11:46Z	(#zdoe7hq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I think that‚Äôs a fair assessment. Apart from the very top level, I feel there are a lot of good people with a lot of good intentions. I do agree that it will inevitably cross the line but it‚Äôll be the kind of thing where a lot of politicians probably won‚Äôt care because they won‚Äôt be alive long enough to see extreme abuse of their policies and laws, which we already see with climate change inaction from the Australian Liberal Party.
2022-09-27T08:16:36Z	(#vfxgqmq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> this is my main issue with a lot of applications of cryptocurrency. This would work just as well with traditional payment methods. I feel a lot of these applications are in effect to just avoid taxes, launder money or wash dirty money. Happy to be proven wrong
2022-09-27T13:50:05Z	(#hsouiwa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> needlessly complicated and still has the exact same security vulnerabilities as web2 and it‚Äôs own security quirks that never seem to be front of mind üòÖ
2022-09-27T21:08:23Z	(#mlsmpia) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and people are trying to push for health care information on the blockchain in the form of NFTs. They truely don‚Äôt see how much of an awful idea this is
2023-01-31T00:57:59Z	üëã Sheesh! I‚Äôve been gone for a good while. Lots of stuff going on between work, new sleep schedule for the kiddo and other personal things. How‚Äôs everyone going over here?
2023-01-31T01:49:24Z	(#dmpg2ba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> agreed! I‚Äôm 100% keen for this. Will need to link up over Signal to discuss details.‚Ä®‚Ä®Consulting life certainly is tougher and more cut throat than I initially expected üòÖ
2023-01-31T10:36:17Z	Out of interest, anyone use a secure IRC client for iOS? Ideally E2EE, but open to suggestions. I figure just going to the App Store and finding the first client may be‚Ä¶risky

2023-02-06T23:32:48Z	(#xjpvgoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> how‚Äôs the readability, minus the issues with spacing? Genuinely interested to see if this is a meaningful improvement on current fonts
2023-02-07T03:16:55Z	(#xjpvgoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> üòÜit‚Äôs only early days. Maybe you‚Äôre view will change over time! /s‚Ä®‚Ä®The spaces are definitely too much for me to realistically use.

2023-02-07T20:25:29Z	Recently, for the first time ever, I decided to give dual booting a try. It‚Äôs actually been working really well. I use Parrot OS (Home Edition) for daily use and Windows 11 for all of my gaming needs. Eventually, I‚Äôd like to back up just my games and format all of my storage so I can start those off fresh.‚Ä®‚Ä®I must say, using a Linux OS as my daily driver OS has been super fun and useful, considering I don‚Äôt have to spin up a VM or WLS whenever I want to do some form of sysadmin work (I‚Äôm much more comfortable in a Unix terminal than Windows üòÖ)
2023-02-07T22:17:45Z	(#qlh77ja) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Oh no, the whole preferred shell thing is a plus, but I split them into 2 different applications: Windows for gaming and Parrot OS for everything else.
2023-02-09T05:21:21Z	(#fjtdvda) I should be available to attend at 0500 UTC! That would be 3pm AEST, correct?‚Ä®‚Ä®Also, for those who can‚Äôt attend, is there a view to take and provide minutes? If no, I‚Äôd be more than happy to do so (75% of my job in meetings at work üòÇ)

2023-02-15T04:08:39Z	(#gz5euha) My view is, if we ever get to a point that a true ‚ÄúAI‚Äù can be created, something that can entirely learn new concepts by itself and exponentially expand it‚Äôs own knowledge base without being told to do so (basically what I would consider sentient at that point), humans won‚Äôt know about it until it‚Äôs significantly too late to stop it.

2023-03-01T04:49:55Z	(#7ycjsea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> bit of an edge case but depending on the number of emails you‚Äôre getting for a password reset, they could be doing a widespread attack to cause notification fatigue for when they send out mass phishing emails.‚Ä®‚Ä®In reality, this attack would look like:‚Ä®Attacker uses a script to cycle password resets -> user gets fatigued due to number of password reset emails -> phishing email sent -> user uses malicious link and form to provide the attacker with their credentials.‚Ä®‚Ä®If you‚Äôre only getting a couple of these, probably not but could also be spread across weeks or months of 1 per day. I personally haven‚Äôt seen this attack in practice, but could be a possibility

2023-03-08T08:05:57Z	(#yy2couq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yeah, I can understand that.

2023-03-26T22:50:23Z	(#hg2azfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ooooo I really like this update! I‚Äôll have to update on my end and rollback my `.anchor {‚Ä®display: none;‚Ä®}`
2023-03-28T04:08:01Z	Been trying to get a `vultr.com` VPS up and running to host production websites on using `zs`.‚Ä®‚Ä®The default Debian and Ubuntu headless offerings come with a very unfamiliar shell that I, for some reason, can‚Äôt properly install `zs` on so will need to explore options for custom ISOs of a Debian/Ubuntu distro to use.

2024-01-04T10:00:54Z	Big win today!‚Ä®‚Ä®I've only been exposed to using Kusto Query Language (KQL) at work for a month and a half, but I was able to edit a query to include a datatable (essentially a table that's created in memory when you run the query and is only used for that query) to replace any IDs listed in it with the proper name of the service!‚Ä®‚Ä®Baby steps :)
2024-01-05T02:14:13Z	(#vyp5qoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> wow‚Ä¶‚Ä®‚Ä®I really don‚Äôt see the train of thought of making something so simple to implement (specifically SSO) a paid ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù feature to justify a price point.‚Ä®‚Ä®Hell, I could probably implement the feature in a couple of hours and I have very limited development experience üòÖ‚Ä®‚Ä®They could also re-evaluate the price point then add more features to the paid plan (that ideally add much more value than SSO) and then raising the price when it makes sense to. So many companies do this right now anyway.‚Ä®‚Ä®On the whole paid features for self-hosting, I ran into this issue myself when implementing a SIEM on my network. I initially implemented the Elastic stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) but then they go ahead and lock things like creating detection rules and sending alerts via anything other than email a paid feature ü´†‚Ä®‚Ä®I‚Äôd be much happier if the industry switched to a one time self-hosting service with no support, with the option to purchase support licenses at a monthly cost.
