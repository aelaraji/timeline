2021-10-07T01:22:25Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> is there a better way to mention others while using jenny?
2021-10-07T02:24:36Z	👋🏻 hello world... again!
2021-10-07T11:48:44Z	I might have figure out what was causing duplicated entries here. I think running `jenny -f` while mutt is open was causing it. I have disabled the cron job, and it doesn't seem to be happening anymore. Let's see how accurate my theory is. 😂
2021-10-07T11:54:12Z	I need someone with a nice, and clean twtxt.txt feed. One that doesn't include much--if any--images, and in which twts have more content. Just looking to see how formatting is handled in `jenny` and how to tweak it to my liking.
2021-10-07T11:56:12Z	It looks like @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> isn't too active these days. This little piece of software is pretty neat!
2021-10-07T12:57:58Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> how can you keep up with that inmense "follow" list you carry? 🥵
2021-10-07T13:58:56Z	Trying to troubleshoot twtxt. On twtxt.net, discovery shows my follows linked to https://twtxt.netbros.com/, which is nothing (not even an index.html running there), while on arrakis.netbros.com shows my follows linked to https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt (using yarns links too) which is right.
2021-10-07T14:26:54Z	@<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#<ov22csa https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt>) Good morning! 👋🏻
2021-10-07T15:01:53Z	@<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#<fznwila https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt>) Hi there! 👋🏻You are the first one replying to twt on this feed, thank you! I shall reward you with season's symbols: 🍁🍂
2021-10-07T19:20:15Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<i2xczwa https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt>) Ah, I see. I mean, it is not biggie, as normally I just reply to people, so that part works beautifully. A vi/vim script would work, but it is not universal. What if I use joe, or Emacs, or nano? Meh, jenny is awesome as is, thank you for it! ☺️
2021-10-07T19:34:20Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I noticed that if I ran `jenny -f` on a cron job, and kept `mutt` open, messages will get duplicated (same message, time, different message-id). I run it now on a small script before opening `mutt`.
2021-10-10T13:27:54Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<6b4cngq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>) This is awesome! Your server/connection is slow, thought. It took ages to load the GIF! Off topic, what font are you using on that screenshot?
2021-10-10T13:38:32Z	Hmm... "completefunc" is not set.
2021-10-10T13:50:49Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<6b4cngq https://twtxt.net/conv/6b4cngq>) I am getting an error with "completfunc" as being undefined. What could it be?
2021-10-10T14:04:03Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<6b4cngq https://twtxt.net/conv/6b4cngq>) "Option completefunc is not set" is the exact message I am getting.
2021-10-10T14:50:09Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<otcq4aq https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt>) I followed the README instructions.
2021-10-10T14:51:09Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<otcq4aq https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt>) I did a `git pull` but that isn't pulling jenny-posting.eml. Am I missing something?
2021-10-10T14:57:08Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<xzihj6a https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt>) I am on the South East US.
2021-10-10T15:05:20Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I got it! I had jenny under my ~/.local/bin/, and didn't realised the one on the repo changed. D'oh! I am symlinking it now, so this doesn't happen again. I love autocomplete!
2021-10-10T23:46:45Z	Oh, crap, the weekend is gone---and it was a three days weekend for me! Tomorrow back to the hammer, while wife enjoys her Columbus Day off. 😤
2021-10-11T00:01:40Z	Seeing repeated twts again. Only thing I am doing different is running `jenny` every 5 minutes on a cron job. I really don't know what to think.
2021-10-11T00:08:01Z	@<quark https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt> (#<iktswaa https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt>) I have removed the cron job, and added `jenny -f` to the small script that starts mutt with the `.muttrc-jenny` file. That way when I open, it refresh the feed before. Let's see how it goes.
2021-10-11T00:10:33Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>, what will I need to do so that the timestamp for twts reflects local time. Right now it is UTC. Can it be done, or is that something from the twtxt spec?
2021-10-11T10:56:30Z	Upgrading load balancers. This is always done with extreme care, but also with fingers crossed while wearing my lucky undergarment. 😂
2021-10-11T12:47:02Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<6ck6iaa https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>) 🎉 Happy anniversary!
2021-10-11T12:49:20Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<iktswaa https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt>) I will re-enable the cron job, test again, and provide the information. The twts that were showing duplicated are those I have sent. When it occurred, I noticed the `Message-Id`s were different.
2021-10-11T12:54:20Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<spngeda https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt>) Perfect! Setting the `display_filter` did the trick. I have come across that SE yesterday while looking for answers, but I wanted to make sure there was nothing else I was missing to notice. Thanks! @<quark https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt> (#<spngeda https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt>) Hmm, that’s mostly an issue of how mutt displays the `Date` header. The *index* should already display local time, only the *pager* shows the raw header: https://movq.de/v/8c92fff081/s.png To be honest, I’d like to keep it that way (i.e., `Date` stores the original stamp as it occured in the twtxt feed). To convince mutt to show local time here, you’d probably have to use `display_filter`: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/516101
2021-10-11T13:45:45Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<3y374la https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>) This is what I have been trying to tell you. The issue doesn't occurr on https://tt.vltra.plus (which is now down), nor did it show on my own Yarn pod (now down too). It is only happening on https://twtxt.net.
2021-10-11T14:15:45Z	How would [jenny](https://www.uninformativ.de/git/jenny/file/README.html) handle multiline twts? Let's find out! - One - Two - Three And: 1. One 2. Two 3. Three
2021-10-11T14:16:39Z	@<quark https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt> (#<utyqazq https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt>) Answering to myself: it doesn't. @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>, would that be something that it could be added?
2021-10-11T14:43:29Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<utyqazq https://twtxt.netbros.com/twtxt.txt>) Awesome! 🙇🏻‍♂️
2021-10-11T15:23:30Z	@<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> (#<bjrh6ea https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt>) LOL, thanks! I have always been a fan of the Ferengi, and Quark, in particular. I think only Rom gets closer to him.
2021-10-11T17:52:00Z	Well, I have changed URLs, so this post might not get through, or break follows, or break everything. So, yeah.
2021-10-11T18:24:56Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<3y374la https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>) Hopefully this URL change fixes things. Otherwise I am lost; don't know what's going on. 😩
2021-10-11T20:10:08Z	@<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#<3y374la https://f.adi.onl/search?tag=3y374la>) Yes, it did---at least I don't see the same issue as before on twtxt.net. Weird, as it was never an issue on other pods. 🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-10-11T20:44:01Z	I wonder how can I set, on Mutt, a shorter subject (elipsed) on the status bar, while reading a email (or a twt).
2021-10-11T22:01:04Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<utyqazq https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>) I changed base URL (like, completely), but I am still honouring the old one, pointing it to the new one with 301. Maybe that's what's happening with the older posts. I could drop out the 301 completely, but that will break following, right?
2021-10-11T23:34:37Z	What to watch tonight? "Squid Game" completed. "Seinfeld" just made it in a couple of days ago, maybe I will reminisce old memories and watch it. I first watched it in 1995-ish.
2021-10-12T02:09:44Z	@<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#<alckbha https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt>) I don't remember. I knew about twtxt for a long time. I often seek information about microblogs, and I believe I came across Yarn while browsing the Tubes.
2021-10-12T13:13:47Z	@<laz https://tt.vltra.plus/user/laz/twtxt.txt> (#<7puavoq https://tt.vltra.plus/user/laz/twtxt.txt>) You can delete quark, and rename/refollow quark2 as quark. The other isn't coming back. I am the only Ferengi around here... for now. We are always expanding, following our very wise "Rules of Acquisition". 😂
2021-10-12T13:51:40Z	@<laz https://tt.vltra.plus/user/laz/twtxt.txt> (#<zatljoq https://tt.vltra.plus/user/laz/twtxt.txt>) I think on Yarn you can block. That would be the only viable option here. Not that elegant, but I don't see any other way.
2021-10-12T14:09:19Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<zatljoq https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>) This is messy. @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, you are replying to `quark@ferengi.one` but using `@quark@twtxt.netbros.com` instead. I know part of it is my fault, but there has to be a better way to avoid all this.
2021-10-12T14:18:24Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<zatljoq https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>) Yup, the other one is simply legacy, gone, finito. 🤣
2021-10-12T14:26:49Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<ta7mjua https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>) You got it! 👏🏻 Yarn is truly getting there!
2021-10-12T14:41:35Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<horh62a https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>, if you want/can I can send you a Zoom link to test it interactively!
2021-10-12T14:44:00Z	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#<7owh43q https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>) Oooooh! The makes sense on the mentioning of her being Romanian. 🙂 Thanks for clarifying that, I would have never gotten it.

2021-10-12T14:59:16Z	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#<rwi64nq https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>) That is correct, you can unfollow/unsubscribe it.
2021-10-12T18:04:20Z	Is it Friday yet? I feel this week is as slow as a drying paint on wall, and it is only Tuesday! I know I should not want time to pass quick, as that get us closer to the inevitable, but geez!
2021-10-12T20:19:08Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<pe5ymoa https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>) Sure thing, mate! I do not discount that it could be something stupid I am doing. My list of those is large, and rich. 🤣

2021-10-13T13:09:06Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>, how do you handle twts in Mutt? I mean, how do you organise, or manage the inmense amount that comes throught? Do you delete/trim? Move things to folders? Or simply keep that huge (12,000+ for me now) list?
2021-10-13T14:17:07Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#<m3tvcyq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>) I hear you. I am *very* selective of who to follow. I mean, I would drop @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, which is the noisiest one, but he is the boss, and if I want to interact--even once or twice a week--I must follow him. 🤣

On desktop everything is huge, and I assumed it was to cater short-sightedness. Also, you have enabled underlines on buttons on iOS, bold and bigger fonts, etc., so that was also a give away. Sorry if I digress, but, glasses wouldn't help? I have to wear mine all the time, otherwise I am also near blind myself!

2021-10-15T14:54:12Z	Apple's event on Monday is bringing, as always, speculation to the table. One thing most outlets seem to agree is the introduction of an "M1X" chip, thought Apple might call it differently. M1X might also mean, M1(we don't know what comes after, or next generation). Either way, I would really like to see the return of the 27" iMac, but I will not hold my breath. Nevertheless, Monday is going to be an exciting day for many, including me! 🍎

2021-10-15T20:48:35Z	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#<lilexaa https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>) Unless you are stripping stuff on your twts, there is no much to implement. Things will be **bold** , *italics* , _underlined_ , and so on, on a client that can render them. Since jenny uses Mutt, I can use my own regex in it to color them as I like. That's pretty much it.

You know, like email does. Other than to reply to the top post (for which I use reply), I don't use reply but fork, to reply to posts underneath because it is the logical thing to do.

It simply doesn't promote engagement. On top of that, all replies show on the timeline as well, without much---to none---context.

2021-10-16T11:35:08Z	Having used---and still using---1Password (a password manager) for many years, I have gone through a few stages of disliking/frustration with it. The first was when subscriptions were set in place, the second is now, with their approach for auto-filling under iOS. It is, more often than I would like to, telling me to configure it when I did so from day one. My open support ticket isn't going too far either.  I wish iCloud KeyChain would mimic some of its features, so I can just dump it. KeyChain has improved a lot, now allowing OTP to be saved with a credential, but it is still not quite there yet.

2021-10-16T12:30:28Z	I am noticing that Yarn doesn't treat "outside" (that is, twts coming from a client other than Yarn) twts hashes right. Two examples:  - https://twtxt.net/twt/mwtnrna - https://twtxt.net/twt/fl5dooq  There are many more, but those two will give you the gist. Yarn links the hash to the poster's twtxt.txt, so conversation matching will not work.

2021-10-18T17:40:25Z	(#nrnseeq) Got to dash now, my turn to speak at my meeting. 😩
2021-10-18T17:48:00Z	(#7hyonva) Up to 64GB RAM! 😮
2021-10-18T17:56:31Z	(#nrnseeq) No new iMacs, or Mac minis. I really wanted a new iMac with the new SoC, and a bigger screen. Not this time. 😩
2021-10-18T18:26:01Z	@<stigatle https://twtxt.net/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> (#nrnseeq) You can get an Air for $1,000 (or $1,200 with 16GB). I have used it (with 8GB), and that machine flies. I can't imagine how fast one with an M1MAX will feel.
2021-10-18T18:27:46Z	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#r67hd3q) LOL. Some days I feel like Forrest Gump, wanting to mow just for fun. Others is a chore. The other are way more frequent than the some. LOL.
2021-10-18T19:39:56Z	@<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> (#5mtlmcq) Just as jlj, that is exactly what I meant. Good point, Lyse!
2021-10-18T20:12:38Z	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#mehlzga) Not anymore 😭. I still have a self-propelled one, and electric, which is very nice. But when you live under an almost constant 32-35℃, with super high humidity, you cease liking working outside pretty quick.
2021-10-18T20:34:38Z	@<stigatle https://twtxt.net/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> (#txxq7pq) It is a lovely view! That's home office, or work office? I am hoping the second, though I do not know Norway's days and nights well. I know that Sweden can get pretty dark, or pretty light, for long periods of time.
2021-10-18T20:35:55Z	@<stigatle https://twtxt.net/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> (#txxq7pq) Oh wow, that second one! 😍
2021-10-18T23:09:55Z	@<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#7hyonva) They are **new** MBPs, with two screen sizes, not new screen sizes 😊. 14" and 16". Both can be configured with the M1MAX, but having that SoC automatically bumps the RAM to 32GB, making them somewhat pricey.
2021-10-19T00:47:33Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#wym7vnq) You are the most active of us all, so, probably you. 😜
2021-10-19T00:50:39Z	(#wym7vnq) Now, if there is going to be some sort of price, which for me equals to profit, then I will twt non-stop until **I** hit it! 🤣
2021-10-19T01:04:30Z	@<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> (#ah44qrq) RSS links are archaic. Clients discover them if properly linked, they do not need to be human visible.
2021-10-19T01:27:37Z	@<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> (#ah44qrq) Seems like you need to make your parser smarter. Go tinker! 😋
2021-10-19T01:36:00Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#tkbbmjq) Entering a plain URL on feeds.twtxt.net renders a 500. Like entering ckunte.net gets 500, but http://ckunte.net doesn't. 🤌🏻
2021-10-19T11:11:30Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> what is your cron job repeat time for jenny? Currently I have mine to every minute, and while it allows me to participate fairly quick on conversations it has some drawbacks: it captures every single edited twt, so I end up with seemingly the same twt, but not quite---as it has minor edits, etc. So, "repeats". Perhaps setting cron to check every 5 minutes or so is best?
2021-10-19T11:24:33Z	📖 "When no appropriate rule applies, make one up." Good morning! Lovely morning in Ferenginar today.
2021-10-19T11:50:13Z	@<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#egdmpoa) Are those the kind of things people usually talk to each other when they meet on Tinder? Asking for a friend. 🤣
2021-10-19T12:13:25Z	@<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> (#bnypz6a) I really would like to know the logic behind that reasoning.
2021-10-19T12:15:36Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#3kd355q) Fair enough, I will modify my cron job to match. When I come across edited twts, I just delete both knowing jenny will fetch the right one next iteration. I like keeping things tidy. 😊
2021-10-19T12:25:03Z	>'Trump filed a lawsuit Monday in DC District Court against the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection and the National Archives in an effort to keep records from his presidency secret by claiming executive privilege.' --- [CNN Politics](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/18/politics/trump-white-house-records/index.html)  That only increases one's curiosity about what's in them.
2021-10-19T16:47:27Z	@<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#gzd5mlq) Just like your highschool girlfriend in Afghanistan "doesn't need saving", right? I think it is a language issue you are having, as English isn't your mother tongue.  QAnon followers are cultist nuts. Some of them wanting out are finding that it is a hard thing to do (did you read the article?). Saying that "they don't need to escape" is a silly thing to say, at the very least. To me, it just doesn't make sense.
2021-10-19T17:40:59Z	@<stigatle https://twtxt.net/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> (#efbtw6q) A twtxt client would be nice! Or a very simple cgi script to print twts to web nicely---not a second Yarn, just something to show twts in a pretty form on the web.
2021-10-19T17:58:06Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#3xfftqq) I replied to the one he originally sent (and later edited, so it was deleted). That's probably what happened.
2021-10-19T18:19:34Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#3xfftqq) >and the little cricket story stays there forever.  🤣🤣🤣
2021-10-19T20:01:12Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#ck2oria) With those two (Message-ID, and In-Reply-To) the hashing could become superfluous, and no longer needed. I would vote for that!
2021-10-19T23:54:07Z	@<stackeffect https://twtxt.stackeffect.de/stackeffect.txt> (#3bxc7zq) I am seeing this characters on your twts: )?â\200¨â\200¨. Which client are you using?
2021-10-20T12:45:42Z	@<stigatle https://twtxt.net/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> (#5jejozq) I really do not understand **anyone** not willing to get vaccinated. It is just plain stupid.
2021-10-20T12:49:46Z	@<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> (#jj56spq) Google or (insert your favourite search engine here) have never let me down. Also, Youtube has repair guides, and HOWTOs for just about anything, and everything.
2021-10-20T14:11:12Z	Is it me, or Gmail's web interface is going down the drain? Using Safari---my default browser---often takes two, or three clicks to open an email. If it weren't because its search is amazing, I would never visit its web interface.
2021-10-20T14:25:50Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#5jejozq) I still worry, perhaps a little less. But I still take precautions. For me, and for others. I mean, you might have a bullet proof vest, but even so, would you actively seek to get shot?
2021-10-20T15:26:10Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#5jejozq) No worries, I understood you perfectly. My reply was merely a commentary, because some here---specially the youth, and I have a 20 years old son---think that the vaccine makes the 100% impervious, and thus behave pretty stupidly.  I am the one in charge of bringing food, and helping the elderly in the family, so I take super extra precautions... for their sake.
2021-10-20T15:49:05Z	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#ck2oria) Bottomline, twtxt is a poor's man email system. 🤣
2021-10-20T18:12:16Z	@<stackeffect https://twtxt.stackeffect.de/stackeffect.txt> (#3bxc7zq) >now Apache also announces content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8  Well, that fixed things. 🥳
2021-10-20T18:15:32Z	@<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> (#ctdtuta) I prefer darch's one.
2021-10-20T18:16:38Z	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#p6vbmtq) Indeed, it is a fairly common "disease". 🤣
2021-10-21T02:10:48Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> would it be possible to trim the subject to, say, 100 or 140 characters? Just the subject.
2021-10-21T02:16:29Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ifphkga) Jenny populates Mutt's subject with the entire twt. That makes for very, very long subject lines.
2021-10-21T02:26:59Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ifphkga) Sounds like a good plan. It is, of course, up to the Master Crafter. 😋
2021-10-21T11:01:39Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#sojctqq) It is still too early, and too few of us. Give it some time, and your wife might revise her statement. 😂
2021-10-21T11:03:54Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#boco3fq) I find sleeping while storming the best sleep, and we have hurricanes passing by, or near by, almost every year.
2021-10-21T11:40:45Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#ifphkga) >If `Subject` contains the full twt, then you can skim over conversations just by reading those lines in mutt’s index pager  Yes, I do the same, true.  >So I decided: Okay, let’s have mutt do it.  And Mutt does it well. I agree it was/is a good idea.  >The subject lines are already “compressed”  I noticed, yes.  I am not sure why I asked to begin with; in retrospect, in was a silly request. Perhaps the OCD in me got triggered while viewing rich headers, on a specific twt, when I saw the huge subject line that is, otherwise, always hidden.  Anyway, don't mind me, move along. 😂
2021-10-21T11:51:33Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> OK, I am on request/question asking mode today. 😋 How do you cancel a twt, or a reply to a twt? Say I hit my reply, and then I change my mind? Right now, even exiting vi is creating an empty line on my twtxt.txt. Is there an obvious way to cancel a twt, reply, or fork that I am missing?
2021-10-21T12:04:25Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#xvcfdma) Aha! Cool! Not just deleting, but proceeding as if the twt is going to be send. If I `:q!` on vi it will add an empty line. If, instead, I go `:x` like I normally do, it works as you said---and as I wanted it. Thanks!
2021-10-21T13:42:55Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#jl77kpa) Yeah, it is kind of rubbish. 😬
2021-10-21T19:32:24Z	>We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favorite American President has been silenced.  LOL! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2021-10-21T19:48:56Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#gxh3f7a) >We should be able to remove those subject hashtags, they’re just noise.  Yes! I would say they are not even needed on the web UI. You click conversations, and that's done by Yarn. No need for humans to see it.
2021-10-21T22:46:34Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#gyxy4ta) Kind of a pickle. I would say, if the user isn't following the feed, then `@something` and `@something@example.com` doesn't get linked.
2021-10-21T23:29:19Z	@<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> (#o7jkpza) It will only use the nick of the person to whom you are replying, no the occasional never ending chain link of nicks. 😄
2021-10-22T00:12:36Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#gyxy4ta) Validating the mention will be consuming, no? I mean, right now it takes a bit when clicking on the nick of an external user. Also, discovery occurs mostly by mentioning, yes? It seems a hard problem to solve.
2021-10-22T00:16:11Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#g2rwfeq) Keep in mind that there are plenty of icons already there, it is a quite busy "neighborhood".

2021-10-23T18:53:09Z	Now, onto the real question: what to eat? Partner isn't home, so zero nutritional supplements have been consumed, and I have been lazy enough not to go out to fetch me something. So... hmm, yeah. Going to an eight years old niece birthday "roller scatting" party in an hour, maybe I get lucky with a slice of pizza, or two. 🤣
2021-10-23T19:01:31Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#fsqsfka) Temme about it! 🤪
2021-10-24T13:06:01Z	Got to love the [sense of humour](https://www.curiositry.com/blog.txt):  >Blog.txt supports multiple options for the chronological order of posts. If you start writing new posts below old posts, the default post sort is descending. If you start writing new posts above all the old posts, like I do, then the post sort algorithm will default to ascending. But if the user would like to change the sort order of the posts, they can press the "End" button on their keyboard to reverse the default chronological order!
2021-10-25T03:33:53Z	@<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> (#yv535na) The signs show fine on jenny. So, it is a display thing. Probably related to Markdown.
2021-10-25T03:35:01Z	@<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> (#yv535na) Some signs from here: $ (one), $$ (two), $$$ (three).
2021-10-25T14:18:19Z	Standby BIG-IP F5s upgraded to TMOS 16.1 (LTS). All their pairs (now on standby) will be upgraded on Wednesday. Just giving the TMOS some time to settle down, and feel at home. Hahahaha!
2021-10-25T17:01:11Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#u6uumbq) Yes, I did ask whether or not it was possible to move twts to an "archive" folder, but it will be the same at @<stackeffect https://twtxt.stackeffect.de/stackeffect.txt> experienced (which I have, too), that is, twts will "come back".  There is no clear solution, I am afraid, right? It is the nature of the beast.
2021-10-25T18:56:51Z	Went to sleep at 01:00, woke up at 06:30, having a really hard time keeping my eyes open, and there is still one more hour till calling it quits. Does being this sleepy counts as being sick?
2021-10-25T19:05:29Z	@<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> (#icvalja)  LOL. Now I need to convince my boss. 😩
2021-10-26T11:59:34Z	My nutritional supplements aim should be:  - 1 or 1.5 cups of lentils (or any beans you might like better). - 2 or 2.5 cups of bitter greens. - 1 cup of your favourite protein (or an egg), grilled, or fried with a little of olive oil. - 1 or 2 tomatoes, or a handful if of the cherry type. - No added sugars. If it is sweet, make it have fibre. - No added salt (or very little and ionised), as salt is everywhere.  Related, I tried wild rice for the first time yesterday. It was different, in a good way.
2021-10-26T19:19:51Z	@<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> (#egrljaa) Boot media created. All set an ready for this weekend. Woot!  ``` sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Monterey.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/USBDrive ```
2021-10-27T15:18:35Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#3ezvila) I would recommend a longer rotation, perhaps? The way I see it, you are proposing a monthly one. That can make metadata huge too. Maybe yearly, or every 6 months?
2021-10-27T16:39:23Z	It looks like the new MBP batteries are easily replaceable. That is positively, and absolutely, a very good news!
2021-10-28T17:37:48Z	My Friday has started. Now, what will I do with this much time?! LOL! Got to remember "dum loquimur, fugerit invida aetas". ⏳

2021-10-29T19:02:32Z	I think it is long due dropping Facebook (now Meta) from the S&P 500 index funds. As an owner of some, I really have a problem with it---and yes, I know there is little I can do but voice it everywhere I make noise online.

2021-11-08T18:57:16Z	(#knlqsca) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Getting this when trying to use it:  ``` error executing template timeline: template: timeline:131:43: executing "twt" at <formatForDateTime>: wrong number of args for formatForDateTime: want 2 got 1 ```
2021-11-08T19:55:12Z	(#pfve2ua) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> I replied to the issue.
2021-11-10T17:57:49Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> woot! I am back on my Ferengi business!
2021-11-15T19:46:21Z	(#j43fuia) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Super awesome! Running the latest now.
2021-11-22T22:15:25Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>, is removing the hash from the body of the twt on the TODO? I read it, but I am unsure if it is there already, or not. 🙈 Sorry if it is, and I failed to spot it!
2021-11-24T16:07:31Z	(#qqt4ruq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Awesome!
2021-12-06T18:21:21Z	(#wbhmhwa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> that's as good as it gets for Winter here. I mean, leaves will fall, but that's about it.
2021-12-09T13:49:19Z	(#qkxsohq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think they were addressed till certain extend. I will check them out, and close as appropriate.
2021-12-09T16:49:47Z	(#dx6wy3a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> more often than not, it is! I mean, I try to go over the changes, but soon find myself in a web (not pun!), all entangled. Then say, "screw it!" and to the bin it goes. 🥴
2021-12-09T16:51:37Z	(#wnincoq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I thought it was just me. I drives me nuts to try reading on that page. I guess I am no longer capable to look at old CRT monitors without side effects.
2021-12-09T21:06:04Z	(#3o5hytq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> one of those tadpoles will one day be a beautiful, succulent, frog. "Hmmm, froooog..." (with Homer Simpson accent).
2021-12-09T21:19:31Z	An ageing rose cries. My first graphical media twt!  ![Old rose cries](https://ferengi.one/i/202112091616.jpg "Old rose cries")
2021-12-09T21:43:04Z	(#vnuhu4a) @<stackeffect https://twtxt.stackeffect.de/stackeffect.txt> I'd say you are future ready! 😂
2022-01-20T02:29:41Z	(#o2bazrq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt>, I am sure profit---or the search for it---was involved. Most likely that pilot was a Ferengi in disguise. We are known to visit lesser planets seeking to exploit. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't. Hoping my fellow Ferengi fares well or, at the very least, lets me know where his Latinum is.
2022-01-20T02:47:09Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I am seeing a problem in which not-so-active users, such as myself, are ending up having a blank "Recent twts from..." under their profiles because, I assume, the cache long expired. What can be done about it? Business personalities such as myself can't be around here that often! Could something be implemented so that, say, the last 10 or 20 twts are always visible under one's profile? Neep-gren!
2022-01-20T03:03:38Z	(#dnn5z3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I fully agree with making it a pod-level setting (forget about user-level, let us not complicate things too much; we all know users know nothing). Should I send a latinum over for this, or will an issue just suffice? Neep-gren!
2022-01-20T03:14:22Z	(#dnn5z3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> let us take the path of less resistance, that is, less effort, for now. I am going to be a great-grandfather before search ever get implemented locally, least one to search on "all pods". In other words, let us don't bite more than we can chew. 😹 Neep-gren!
2022-01-20T20:14:32Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> was the request to remove the hash (subject) from showing on twts discarded? I don't see it on the TODO, so I am curious. Was it something you decided was not worth investing time on?
2022-01-22T03:46:41Z	(#kiveqdq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> you be the man! I can't remember the last time something gave as much troubles as this. The mention and the way to handle images are two things that have stuck in my head. Hopefully this is the last time there is an issue with this one! 🤞🏻
2022-01-22T03:54:29Z	@<benk gemini://kwiecien.us/twtxt.txt> I am using jenny (we chatted a bit on IRC earlier today). I have been using it for over five months now, I think. It is truly a joy to use, specially because you can use the power of Mutt/NeoMutt to read your twts.
2022-01-24T17:52:44Z	(#5gcm2oa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, who calls me name when I am busy profiting? 😂 In a less serious note---because nothing is more serious than making profit, of course---yes, it seems your avatar issue has been fixed. I am kind of sad, I looked forward each day to see which random one was going to show. LOL.
2022-02-28T14:50:52Z	Took a flu medicine last night, and it knocked me down around 22:00. Woke up at 04:00, then slept till 06:30. All has been seemingly fine, not feeling sleepy, and mostly alert... until now. I am having a really hard time keeping my eyes open. 😬
2022-10-13T18:31:22Z	(#4oslzbq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> LOL.
2022-10-14T17:09:15Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>, any plans still to clean up the hash from the twtxt's body? Maybe a Festivus gift? You know, "for the rest of us". :-D
2022-10-14T17:46:41Z	(#z6dnv7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, business is slow (I also just got off that hyoo-män illness that is going around named COVID), so that leaves me some free time on my entrepreneurial hands. 😂  I have always lurked every couple of weeks or so. I see yarn has regressed on the UI! 😬😩
2022-10-14T19:04:47Z	(#3gfgmma) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>, well, yes, that has always been the case. Not just on jenny, but on Yarn. I can't follow everything, and everyone. To see whether is a reply, a simple `h` on mutt shows the headers, and there you have it. That is not too convoluted, is it? I mean, if you really want to know--but why?--it is a simple key press. If I don't see a context on something as obvious as the example you used, it is simply a reply to someone I don't follow, and pretty much ignore. End of story. 😂
2022-10-14T19:08:04Z	(#y5rkw5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, search for "quark" and you will get quack, quart, quirk, and all possible iterations. Not too helpful.
2022-10-14T19:13:05Z	(#t4zm7ha) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>, hey, thank you! :-) Yeah, I am abusing the headers on ferengi.one, sorry about that. Will change it. You know, because Lyse.
2022-10-14T19:15:33Z	(#z6dnv7q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>, fixed. 🙈
2022-11-16T20:13:58Z	(#jwwx6iq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> nice sunset is an understatement. I can feel the coolness approaching!
2023-01-12T04:12:19Z	It seems like https://proxy.vulpes.one/ runs a code that once was written by @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>. Its rendering looks quite nice. Sadly, I am unable to compile it (modified code at https://git.vulpes.one/gopherproxy/).
2023-01-12T04:37:27Z	(#sgww52a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think I spoke too soon. Got it running at https://arrakis.netbros.com/, for now. 😂
2023-01-30T22:39:18Z	(#c3pmcpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> boo, boo, boooooo! :-D :-P
2023-02-01T20:26:38Z	(#mweps3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> aha, a hater! Just the kind I was looking for some serious business that requires some fervent hating. Pay is good, you up to? :-D :-P
2023-07-28T15:31:57Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>, do you have an example of conf.json in which I can see all the configuration possibilities? Thanks!
2024-02-13T14:37:36Z	(#ihvwsua) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> weird you mentioned my with the `anthony.buc.ci` account. I am assuming these kind of bugs were never addressed by @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>. :-(
2024-02-13T14:39:04Z	(#wij4nza) and by me, I meant Bender. LOL.
2024-02-14T15:21:30Z	If Canonical really want to entice the enterprise to buy support, they really need to step up. As of now they are not even close to offer the quality of support Red Hat offers. Not even close.
2024-02-20T17:48:14Z	(#r4vadlq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> wow, I can tell I am older than you (I already knew this, but still). It was nothing but Pascal for me.
2024-02-22T19:40:44Z	(#jxstj5q) @<johanbove https://johanbove.info/twtxt.txt> dear lord! Can you still sleep at night?!
2024-03-13T19:24:31Z	(#ci52uvq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt>, in your blog, I think a "line-heigh" of 1.5 (if I remember correctly you are setting it on the "body" on CSS) will make it more legible.
2024-03-28T19:02:40Z	(#pssl4pa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> ha! He goes his "poem":  > A string of letters, a forgotten name, > An email crafted, a message to claim. > We hit send with a click, a hopeful sigh, > But a bounce-back arrives, a tear in our eye. > > "Delivery failed," the message reads cold, > The address it seems, is a story untold. > A ghost in the system, a memory's trace, > Lost in the void of cyberspace.   :-D
2024-03-28T19:28:00Z	(#yhh3rfa) @<sorenpeter https://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> a poem about me giving Odo a free bucket:  > A glint in his eye, a sly, Ferengi grin, > Quark crossed the promenade, a curious thing within. > No jeweled trinket, no weapon so grand, > But a simple pail held tight in his hand. >  > Odo, the Constable, with a brow raised high, > "A bucket, Quark? What trickery do you try?" > The Ferengi huckster, with a salesman's flair, > "A gift, my friend, a constable's rare!" >  > "For those late-night spills, a morphing mishap, > This bucket, dear Odo, will catch every scrap.  > And should a suspect turn to goop and flee, > This pail's the answer, a guarantor, you see!" >  > Odo's lips twitched, a hint of a smile, > At Quark's twisted logic, his mercantile style. > "Perhaps," he conceded, the bucket held tight, > "A useful addition, in the pursuit of right." >  > So Quark made his sale, with a wink and a nod, > A bucket for Odo, a Ferengi oddity, odd. > But on Deep Space Nine, where chaos takes hold, > Even a pail can be worth more than gold.   About the account, thanks, but I already have way too many. :-D
