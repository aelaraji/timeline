2019-10-26T00:12:23+02:00	Added myself to the user list at https://github.com/mdom/we-are-twtxt
2019-10-26T00:26:47+02:00	@<ckipp https://chronica.xyz/hallway.txt> https://webring.xxiivv.com/hallway.html looks amazing! How does it work?

2019-10-26T13:44:52+02:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> The IndieWeb.org twtxt article is only a stub - me copy-pasting content from other sites - could use some more sections - @t himself found it an interesting concept
2019-10-26T13:46:19+02:00	Looking at text-first design: https://indieweb.org/text-first_design
2019-10-26T15:27:06+02:00	Beautiful autumn day today
2019-10-26T21:37:14+02:00	Going to see Terminator Dark Fate next tuesday - somewhat big expectations

2019-10-27T23:18:43+01:00	Added clients and articles sections and added domgoergen's twtxt.txt to https://indieweb.org/twtxt
2019-10-27T23:45:50+01:00	Updated my daily journal at gopher://gopher.johanbove.info:70/notes
2019-10-28T08:57:34+01:00	My gopher site is about 38K big - still plenty of space left on the 1.24MB floppy disk
2019-10-28T22:11:06+01:00	@<mdosch https://mdosch.de/twtxt.txt> I thought it was a nice practice to share interesting twtxt-ers through a follow tweet
2019-10-28T22:16:44+01:00	Discovered some new twtxt _followers_ by glancing at my web server logs.. Feeling so l33t now.
2019-10-28T22:59:57+01:00	@<mdom https://domgoergen.com/twtxt/mdom.txt> The news site at gopher://taz.de:70/ is really cool. How did you make it?
2019-10-28T23:01:59+01:00	@<von https://tilde.town/~von/twtxt.txt> Why do you want to keep your twtxt.txt more private if I may ask so?
2019-10-28T23:08:48+01:00	One of the biggest twtxt feed files I could find is still only 127 KB big
2019-10-30T13:05:40+0100	twtxt is über cool
2019-10-30T13:16:27+0100	@<adiabatic https://www.frogorbits.com/twtxt.txt> the 0 indicates the txt file type in gophermaps. Gopherholes are made up of mostly plain text files. Does that answer your question?
2019-10-30T13:21:16+0100	Made my own super basic twtxt client in 3 lines of code as a bashrc function. #l33t
2019-10-30T13:27:11+0100	@<reednj http://twtxt.xyz/u/reednj.txt> Thanks for making and hosting http://twtxt.xyz - the agreggation of twtxts users, tweets and tags is really cool
2019-10-30T13:51:06+0100	Listing to a Deezer playlist with a mix of Leftfield, Moderat, Amon Tobin, The Chemical Brothers, etc
2019-10-30T14:51:43+0100	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> twtxt.txt file splitting for achival is an interesting idea. Should not need to be yearly only. High volume feeds could split faster. Needs a spec though.
2019-10-30T15:48:00+0100	@<von https://tilde.town/~von/twtxt.txt> having topic-specific twtxt feeds is not a silly idea. Not sure if the clients allow easy switching though.
2019-10-30T16:22:26+0100	@<von https://tilde.town/~von/twtxt.txt> Understanding you. For me: keeping a bullet-journal on a paper notebook helped me herd my chaotic mind into manageable streams. See https://bulletjournal.com
2019-10-31T07:15:21+01:00	Proud of myself for achieving a 10 day streak of writing a daily journal log entry.
2019-10-31T11:28:01+0100	Should I do another Movember campaign this year or not?
2019-10-31T11:46:34+0100	This will show my age: do kids these days know what LAN-parties were?
2019-10-31T22:32:38+01:00	Why the heck people would deliberately buy an iphone XR is beyond me.
2019-10-31T22:57:41+01:00	I feel like I only scratched the surface of what Vim really is capable off.
2019-10-31T22:59:12+01:00	Considering: https://indieweb.org/Twitter#How_to_unfollow_everyone_but_still_read_their_tweets

2019-10-31T23:24:19+01:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> (re: Splitting) Good stuff kas++ What command or script did you use to split by year?
2019-11-01T00:53:17+01:00	Vim really has the best commands for typo-fixing: r, a
2019-11-01T14:47:38+01:00	@<frogor https://www.frogorbits.com/twtxt.txt> (re: iphone xr) compared to the Iphone 7. XR might be more powerful but it's clumsy to hold as big and heavy. Does not feel like a phone at all.
2019-11-01T15:07:14+01:00	Anyone still using Skype actually? Seems like the service completely lost to WhatsApp.
2019-11-02T20:34:21+01:00	Donated 500ml of my own blood today at the Uniklinik in Düsseldorf to help others in need.
2019-11-02T23:36:37+01:00	As my hardware is getting older, I feel myself getting more attracted to retro-computing.
2019-11-02T23:50:10+01:00	Enjoying the constraints of the Gopher protocol as a minimalistic zen-mode kind of online publishing revival.
2019-11-03T21:09:51+01:00	My 2014 Android Moto-X is finally out-of-order - the battery life is close to flat-lining and when it boots it gets stuck for a really long time in the _optimizing apps_ mode. The case is cracked. Goodbye old friend.

2019-11-04T14:02:43+0100	@<adiabatic https://www.frogorbits.com/twtxt.txt> (re: iphone xr) True. The battery life is great - especially since it is new. FaceID is very handy indeed. The bigger screen estate is amazing too. Also esim might be cool - if only my provider would support it.
2019-11-04T14:43:04+0100	German grammar is really tricky sometimes when it comes down to writing user-interface labels
2019-11-04T23:38:02+01:00	@<lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> (re: bullet journal) Agreeing that BuJo kind of saved my mind too. It now takes me about three months to fill up 251 pages with tasks, notes and events.
2019-11-05T09:02:29+01:00	Funny how not that long ago I made a remark to a friend who was keeping all his notes as txt files and now I am looking at doing exactly that. txt will probably be the one format that will be around for a very long time still.
2019-11-05T23:01:50+01:00	$ cd gopherhole && vim notes/.

2019-11-09T22:41:29+01:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> [re: gopher client] If you happen to be on Windows, then Gopher Browser for Windows by Matt Owen is pretty nice, otherwise I use Lynx indeed for gopher.

2019-11-11T09:22:00+0100	@<robbinaer https://robbinaer.info/twtxt.txt> The domain move seems to have worked. :-)
2019-11-11T09:24:16+0100	twtxt feels a little like launching simple digital bottle notes into the vast oceans of the Internet

2019-11-12T08:35:01+01:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> I like your gopher server's formatting, nice and clean and how did you implement the TLS certificate?
2019-11-15T21:59:35+01:00	Signing my twtxt with my johanbove@keybase.io account from today onwards
2019-11-16T21:17:35+01:00	Currently lost in txt nirvana over at http://textfiles.com/100

2019-12-09T22:19:44+01:00	In a rather gloomy dark mood today. Been listening to Anne Clark - Our Darkness on repeat
2019-12-09T22:20:39+01:00	Listening to Dance with the Dead - Eye Of Madness from their album The Shape
2019-12-09T22:21:23+01:00	Am I real? How do I know?
2019-12-09T22:22:57+01:00	Twtxt is real enough. Feels funny to be so open writing here, yet nobody knows twtxt.txt is here - part of the charm
2019-12-09T22:25:24+01:00	Opening the man page for tail feels very vestigial
2019-12-16T23:19:22+01:00	Finally creating PHP programs using Composer and Twig templates
2019-12-16T23:22:02+01:00	Keybase and Stellar's SpaceDrop unfortunately was naive in thinking greedy clever hackers wouldn't find ways to scam the give-away for more Lumens and ruin it for everyone else.
2019-12-19T09:53:17+0100	@<xandkar https://xandkar.net/twtxt.txt> Welcome to Twtxt! Noticed a typo in your twtxt user-agent handle. It is pointing to txtxt.txt.

2020-01-03T16:32:31+0100	Happy New Year Twtxt!	
2020-01-03T16:36:53+0100	The twtxt.xyz domain is a 1000 days old and expires on 2020-04-07. Wondering if anyone will renew it?
2020-01-06T16:18:54+0100	@<lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> [re: abandoned ideas] Thanks for the inspiration! How do you keep track of projects now? Do you know about TaskWarrior?
2020-01-20T12:01:21+0100	Live long and prosper 🖖
2020-04-06T22:42:38+02:00	Tempus Fugit
2020-04-06T23:43:27+02:00	New post on my Gopher site. Back to updating it once a month.
2020-04-16T21:58:24+02:00	We are thinking of you Grandpa Ivo. May the peaches be forever ripe and juicy where you are.
2020-04-16T22:33:49+02:00	Listening to Voodoo Chile by Jimi Hendrix while enjoying a Belgian Leffe during these dark hours.
2020-04-22T23:41:04+02:00	Retro-fitting my music collection and music players with early 20s digital stereo MiniDisc technology.
2020-04-30T00:00:00+02:00	I'm enjoying listening to music on my re-discovered #MiniDisc players. Pop in the disc, press play and listen to about 150 minutes of your own music in clear digital quality.
2020-05-07T21:57:47+02:00	Was feeling super nervous and on-the-edge earlier this evening. A cup of chamomile tea later I am feeling again more relaxed.
2020-05-18T14:23:08+0200	Honestly never realized before Beakerbrowser that peer-to-peer could be used to share markdown, JavaScript and html files.
2020-05-22T14:05:34+02:00	Of course the first thing you do after buying media on DVD is to fire up #Handbrake to make a local copy - those discs are just too fragile!
2020-05-25T22:13:54+02:00	Who needs games when you can have fun with contributing to open-source!
2020-07-17T16:26:38+0200	Yeah. I'm still here. Just been busy doing something on Beakerbrowser and Scuttlebutt.
2020-07-17T16:28:36+0200	That Twitter admin hack shows how important it is to own our own online content and even our own platforms for posting on the Web. Want to learn more? Make yourself a cup of your favorite drink and have a look at https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started
2020-07-17T16:30:36+0200	We had to move the nice birdfeeder on our balcony because the birds were making too much of a mess and now I feel bad.
2020-07-27T15:35:56+0200	Since a couple of months on peer-to-peer Web and I'm really convinced that as long as isps do not start messing with firewalls, this could really be the next step in a real Internet of humans.
2020-08-12T13:39:16+0200	Hello Twtxt from a Xubuntu 18.04 machine!
2020-08-12T13:42:20+0200	@<Leo https://www.gkbrk.com/twtxt.txt> Sorry to disappoint. I think I have Finger running on my Raspberrypi but didn't make it public.
2020-08-12T13:43:49+0200	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> I will probably check out twtxt.net later. Can we use it without registering for an account?
2020-08-12T13:48:46+0200	The Mozilla layoffs are really worrying me about the future of the Web.
2020-08-16T21:41:23+0200	Fun setting up basic productivity tools with Syncthing and Todo.txt
2020-08-16T21:44:14+0200	Checking out Todo.txt because it literally is all text files. But will probably still move back to TaskWarrior because I will miss annotations and other features.
2020-08-16T21:46:18+0200	Signing off for the week. Good night!
2020-08-21T00:27:27+0200	Trying to get a grasp and take back control over my family's digital assets.
2020-08-22T00:19:07+0200	Being a Dad is hard as you need to balance being fun with being a parent. But it is really rewarding when all are well and happy.

2020-09-23T09:06:26+0200	Another cool advantage of keeping everything in text files is how fast the search indexer of operating systems gives you results.

2020-11-26T00:00:04+01:00	Getting started with [Restic](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for my backup needs. It's really neat and fast.
2020-11-26T15:21:22+0100	JavaScript applications have become not-to-be-kidding complex lately. I guess that's why I am longing for simpler days.
2020-11-26T15:49:05+0100	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> Could you make the polling of your server a little slower please? Thanks.

2021-06-24T09:57:12+0200	Decided to keep the smart-phone out of our bedroom and keep a note book instead. Already feeling lighter and fresher.
2021-06-25T11:41:12+0200	A beloved colleague passed away after a terrible car accident a couple of days ago. Thoughts go to her family and colleagues.
2021-06-25T12:50:34+0200	I made <https://johanbove.info/twtxt.html> with a couple of lines of JS today. Makes it a bit easier to read my Twtxt feed online.
2021-06-25T12:54:39+0200	When tragedy strikes unexpectedly we cannot just go on as if nothing happened. Our minds need to be given time to deal with the blow. So it is necessary to pause and allow ourselves to process and recover.
2021-06-25T13:10:52+0200	Content-security-policies are an evil necessity. Setting them up securily takes away some fun out of publishing online.

2021-06-26T20:28:35+0200	@<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Yes, nothing much to it. Full source code is free to use :-) I will probably add some analytics and sorting options later.
2021-06-26T20:30:02+0200	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thanks. Nothing much to it. Perhaps I'll make it better later.

2021-06-26T23:41:39+0200	Had a great day at the Leverkusen Neuland park and the Langenfeld Wasserski place with my family!
2021-06-28T10:11:54+0200	Coming back to work today, I found myself still very much grieving for the sudden loss of our dear colleague Filiz - finding some solace in the words of the beautiful song "I grieve" by Peter Gabriel

2021-06-29T10:59:21+0200	The flavours of rosmarin and nutella fit together, right?
2021-06-29T11:19:15+0200	To add another abstraction layer or not, that is the question.
2021-06-29T11:28:11+0200	Look for overcast in Düsseldorf with a temperature of 22.7°C. No rain is expected at this time. Expect a gentle breeze from the WestSouthWest.
2021-06-29T11:32:40+0200	The weather of the moment brought to you with the command ``tweet "$(weather)"``.
2021-06-30T11:56:58+0200	Working with Web components feels a bit like {insert fav fantasy world here} with [concepts](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom) like the Shadow Dom and the Light Dom
2021-06-30T12:14:19+0200	Anyone made a Drum & Bass / Dubstep remix of "Fuel to Fire" by Agnes Obel yet?

2021-07-01T11:19:27+0200	TIL that changing a .bashrc alias to a bash function requires you to restart the terminal as calling `source ~/.bashrc` does not change the alias to the function call.
2021-07-01T13:20:42+0200	The [Weaving The Web Book](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Weaving/Overview.html) by Tim Berners-Lee should be a required read for anyone building on the Web.

2021-07-12T21:50:04+0200	Will the UEFA be responsible for nobody wearing a mask at the Eurocup games when the infection rates sky-rocket - allover again?
2021-07-12T21:50:20+0200	I'm doing this thing again where I am collecting more articles and books to read than actual doing any reading.
2021-07-12T21:50:34+0200	For a blissful month we had our own strawberry garden, now I know what fruitflies live on in the wild.
2021-07-13T16:08:49+0200	After Home-office time is over I will miss being able to multi-task during long meetings.
2021-07-14T11:25:33+0200	Words I cannot type rightly at the first attempt: testimonial, accessibility, successful

2021-07-29T08:59:53+0200	What if due to climate crisis effects and disasters our digital future will depend on low-energy hardware and protocols like Gemini?
2021-08-06T17:52:52+0200	Was feeling a bit down but watching some family videos and pictures from last year brightened me up. Good night.
2021-08-06T17:53:26+0200	What am I doing and why am I doing it, I have no idea. Today is one of those days.
2021-08-06T17:54:57+0200	Why do I keep writing simple English words like change or chance and save or safe, and live or life wrong?
2021-08-13T08:51:20+0200	Waar een wil is, is een weg.
2021-08-19T09:00:35+0200	Can I rely on IPFS mirrors only yet for serving my personal static website? Probably only when you're a popular IPFS oriented site.

2022-01-03T16:29:09+0100	Upgraded my Twtxt feed to 2022 with the twtxt.net meta-data extensions.
2022-01-03T16:34:01+0100	Anyone else see their kids seem bigger in the morning or when not having seen them in a couple of hours? They grow so fast.
2022-01-06T10:30:33+0100	The battery life in this i9 MacBook Pro from 2018 has diminished to being barely enough to serve as an UPS backup system with enough time to perform a safe shutdown
2022-01-06T13:36:23+0100	Oh hello again SSB - reinstalled ManyVerse on all my devices, including my PC
2022-01-06T15:36:33+0100	First rule of SSB is: be patient - it is meant to move slower than conventional social networks
2022-04-28T23:06:38+0200	Ping - still alive and kicking
2022-05-01T23:18:16+0200	So it happened - the twtxt.xyz domain finally expired
2023-03-15T10:07:43+0100	With all this ActivityPub hectic, it is still nice to have a super simple platform like Twttxt to get back to.
2023-03-15T10:08:12+0100	If you're looking for a cool p2p database system have a look at www.earthstar-project.org
2023-03-15T10:09:32+0100	In case you didn't notice, I deleted my Twitter and Keybase accounts. Going full indieweb.
2023-10-27T10:05:39+0200	We're still here!
2023-10-27T10:10:58+0200	Using the CLI to be in-dis-tractable
2023-11-03T09:26:17+0100	Messed up the configuration of the nut UPS monitor so bad it actually initialised an UPS test where the device switched itself off on the reboot of the PC. No idea how that happened. So uninstalled it again.
2023-11-03T15:15:22+0100	Anyone else keeping personal .log files updated through basic shell commands?
2023-11-03T16:26:55+0100	(#3yluutq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Cool to see you're still here too.
2023-11-03T16:32:35+0100	(#3yluutq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I've even added the twthash message hash to my Twtxt bash CLI script so I can properly answer here.
2023-11-03T16:40:55+0100	(#ruxrmxa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Are the apps on F-Droid better?
2023-11-03T16:56:46+0100	Upgraded my Twtxt feed to 2023 with the twtxt.net twthash extension.
2023-11-03T17:23:34+0100	Reading the backlog of my twtxt posts and it's nice to be able to just delete some outdated things by editing a simple txt file.
2023-11-03T17:31:27+0100	On the book wishlist: https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/10/thematic-book-series-how-to-downsize-a-transport-network/
2023-11-03T18:52:53+0100	Just published my very first npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/twthash
2023-11-05T08:05:33+0100	Reorganising and refactoring terminal aliases is a nice way to start a quiet Sunday morning.
2023-11-06T19:48:32+0100	Still find it amazing how I can put almost my whole music collection on a device the size of a human finger nail.
2023-11-06T21:55:15+0100	I salute you,  who can remember Vim's copy paste commands without using a cheatsheet.
2023-11-06T21:56:11+0100	By using scp I can see just how fast my updates are published to the WWW.
2023-11-06T22:25:25+0100	> The situation in Gaza is “more than a humanitarian crisis, it is a crisis of humanity”, Guterres said during a briefing at the UN’s headquarters on Monday.
2023-11-06T23:06:43+0100	Since I have these simple, yet effective bash shell commands, which allow me to edit notes, plans, todos and statuses from the terminal, I feel liberated from overly complex software - everything is just text files and applications which come preinstalled on every Linux system.
2023-11-06T23:07:10+0100	my thoughts are free
2023-11-08T10:25:13+0100	It would be hard to explain to anyone, some fifty years ago, how I accidentally bought apples grown in South-Africa at the supermarket here in Düsseldorf the other day..
2023-11-08T13:30:54+0100	(#qngl2xa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Perhaps we should add a meta flag to Twtxt to stop indexation by ChatGPT and consorts? I already use robots.txt for this.
2023-11-08T13:34:59+0100	'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'  ends up with blind people starving to death.
2023-11-08T20:41:01+0100	I just backed up my twtxt.txt data on a medium that will last for years if treated well: 4 sheets of paper.
2023-11-13T10:53:36+0100	Got the flu shot done for this year
2023-11-13T15:17:02+0100	My cli work-apps: note, plan, dlog (daily log), status and twt.
2023-11-15T11:03:23+0100	Hey Apple, it's 2023 - about time to start supporting the content indexation of markdown files in Spotlight out of the box, don't you think?
2023-11-15T18:31:27.959Z	Refreshing my knowledge on Node.js
2023-11-15T19:06:39.179Z	Building a Twtxt Gui with some JS and HTML as an example application.
2023-11-16T10:00:44.739Z	Fiddling with paths in Node Express for fun
2023-11-16T10:36:04.987Z	Something weird is happening to the new APC UPS - it has an USB Type-C port - but it seems that the power supply is a bit wonky.
2023-11-16T10:40:54.617Z	So the APC UPS power pack's USB port is not capable of providing stable current for both a Macbook and the Iphone, which was also connected to the USB Type-A port next to it. Good to know.
2023-11-16T11:20:58.908Z	So now that I have a basic Twtxt form, I can also update my feed even when I am not on my PC.
2023-11-16T12:13:37.555Z	Wondering how that person in Nebraska is doing keeping that cornerstone open-source package going.
2023-11-17T09:52:16.261Z	ExpressJs is rather fun to work with - at least for a smaller project.
2023-11-18T08:42:51.822Z	My son is getting pretty good at skating.
2023-11-18T15:33:34.534Z	Printing pictures on Linux is still a bit of a challenge.
2023-11-20T15:43:36+0100	Someone at Philips Hue or Amazon Alexa screwed up something, as it seems. My lamps stopped responding to Alexa some days ago and I am not the only one experiencing issues. I guess we can say we enjoyed the (partial free) ride for as long as it lasted. https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue/dp/B01LWAGUG7
2023-11-20T23:24:16+0100	My todotxt done.txt file has over three years worth of stuff in it that I found important enough to put a todo in todotxt for.
2023-11-21T15:33:14+0100	(#a35ceca) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Thanks for reaching out - just general wonkiness with the Epson printing job configuration UI. They offer Fedora software, but it seems that not all features are supported
2023-11-21T15:37:09+0100	(#3voh5ra) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I played that DOS Tetris game too over and over on my PC, mezmerized over the 3D graphics.
2023-11-21T23:30:42.311Z	Good night, good morning, good afternoon.
2023-11-22T12:12:32.668Z	The first cold days of Winter are upon us.
2023-11-22T12:17:37.939Z	First time ever I made something that uses Redis
2023-11-22T14:54:30.291Z	Having fun with React - yet again. A large part of my job entails (re)learning technologies - luckily I have access to some good resources in the form of training- and tutorial sites, all provided by my employer.
2023-11-23T14:12:33+0100	There is a lot of _Black Friday_ promotion happening in Germany these days - I wonder however how many Germans really know where it comes from? Happy _Thanksgiving_ to whoever is celebrating today - as it is one of the few US / Canadian festive days where families - really - try to enjoy their time together.
2023-11-23T14:36:15+0100	With that said: Happy Thanksgiving to anyone celebrating and for everyone else: happy third thursday of November. I am grateful and I thankful I get to share this thought with you all.
2023-11-23T15:20:22.299Z	It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic...
2023-11-23T16:07:11.168Z	Got a great idea for an web app: a flashlight app which uses media-queries to detect if the light, aka the body of the page, should be on (white) or off.
2023-11-24T17:05:41+0100	One of these tricky things of the German language I haven't really gotten the hang of is the difference between: "Ich weiss." and "Ich weiß."
2023-11-24T22:39:36.618Z	Another work week just flew by. 
2023-11-25T11:10:45.997Z	It is that time of year where I try to be extra nice in customer service Quality and feedback surveys. I once worked on the other side of these, so it might brighten someone's day.
2023-11-26T13:26:40.768Z	I'm in your node js, messing with your process.env variables.
2023-11-26T13:42:48.372Z	Figuring out how to properly do session management in Node.js with Redis.
2023-11-27T08:41:19+0100	(#atm7oga) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> This is cool Windows history. Thanks for sharing
2023-11-27T09:51:40.769Z	These guys from the [Sokpop game developers collective](https://www.sokpop.co/) are really cool.
2023-11-28T07:32:34+0100	Keeping the bare minimum of apps installed on my NAS to avoid vulnerabilities.
2023-11-28T07:35:09+0100	Wondering that part of the charm and attraction of Christmas markets could come from a common nostalgia towards every day street markets in towns and a longing for more outside social life during the cold, clammy Winter days.
2023-11-28T07:38:03+0100	Obligatory Twtxt post: I love how I can simply use a terminal window and some very basic tools (echo, scp, ssh) to publish thoughts, as they pop up, onto the Internet in a structured way, that can be found and perhaps even appreciated.
2023-11-28T07:42:52+0100	Started the process of migrating from Github to Codeberg with my projects.
2023-11-28T07:43:07+0100	Github is like Linkedin for Developers
2023-11-28T07:44:30+0100	Going for Codeberg to support a non-profit organisation that stands for the common good.
2023-11-28T18:30:11+0100	If snow fall on the mountains is reducing so much, and this snow acted as a water reservoir formed in Winter to get through the warmer, dry summers, then we should start creating huge water reservoirs on top of mountains; pumping the water up there when it rains.
2023-11-29T17:46:23.504Z	Hurray for password recovery processes.
2023-11-29T17:47:42.559Z	I think I witnessed twice today how someone shop-lifted something from a big department store and ran away with it. One was actually being chased by the shop's security.
2023-11-30T06:40:25.746Z	Enjoying the shower as a sensory depreviation cell.
2023-12-01T07:26:32.017Z	Happy advents calendar month to everyone!
2023-12-01T07:37:37.815Z	Is there a car leasing that does not feel like a trap?
2023-12-01T07:59:52.912Z	The best gift anyone could give me is the time to be able to finish reading some books.
2023-12-01T08:40:21.116Z	Context-switches are a real productivity killer if it means that by the time you get back to the previous context your remote desktop session expired.
2023-12-01T14:11:00.315Z	Feeling nostalgia for simpler web development times.
2023-12-01T14:33:37.081Z	Cache rules everything around us.
2023-12-02T06:46:35.019Z	SCP all the things!
2023-12-02T08:43:53.587Z	My kid is amazing
2023-12-02T19:25:58.345Z	Went to the Christmas market for the first time this year.
2023-12-02T19:46:18.642Z	Streaming services can suck. Wanted to watch the classic Elf movie for a fun movie night, but somehow we were getting the message "This movie is not available in your region.". Turns out we were looking for the wrong title. 
2023-12-02T23:52:11.319Z	My son achieved the kindergarten karate belt white-orange-white. He is really proud too himself.
2023-12-03T07:12:25.975Z	't is the Season to restock on batteries.
2023-12-03T23:04:49.329Z	First snow fall in Düsseldorf city center this evening.
2023-12-03T23:12:08.754Z	Almost six year old loves the New York Rap dance remix from Jan Hammer's "Axel F"  - it's a bit stuck on repeat. The song is from 1985. Coincidentally the year I was five myself.
2023-12-04T07:11:52.155Z	Pretty neat what one can achieve with Node.js Fs, the Express framework, Redis, a text file and some HTML with a sprinkle of CSS.
2023-12-04T07:16:33.527Z	In Memoriam voor mijn grootmoeder Agnes Cours, die vandaag haar 88ste verjaardag had gevierd. We missen je!
2023-12-04T07:21:27.776Z	The local energy Company is doing an Advent contest with a word guessing game, 21 letters long, it starts with a T and I got all other letters by looking at the source of their site... Put all of the letters into ChatGPT 3.5, but it is having real trouble coming up with something plausible.
2023-12-04T07:26:14.799Z	Hey Apple, it's 2023 - about time to start supporting the content indexation of markdown files in Spotlight out of the box, don't you think?
2023-12-04T07:28:47.338Z	Anyone else working with Mac OS (work), Windows (client project) and Fedora (private) on the same day, almost every day?
2023-12-04T13:45:24.291Z	I would love to be able to time travel back to the days when Talking Heads toured and witness one of their epic live concerts.
2023-12-04T22:39:23+0100	Qnap's Hybridmount feature makes it possible for me to access the files on OneDrive as if they were available from a local network drive on my Fedora PC. Pretty neat (when everything works).
2023-12-04T22:43:33+0100	My son said for the first time he wanted to make a game himself today. Going to freshen up my canvas and collision detection skills.
2023-12-05T06:51:32.892Z	Rediscovered how it's possible to show/hide content on an HTML page without JavaScript, using a checkbox and some sprinkle of CSS magic.
2023-12-05T12:04:27.285Z	(#s7cm7iq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The "game" will involve racing and exploding cake - I think he got inspiration from SuperTuxKart. So will see how far we can go. He's only five still..
2023-12-05T15:46:22+0100	With all M$'s apps being basically fancy web apps, there is no need to actually install any of their legacy applications locally anymore. Since I am online basically 100% of the time this turns my Office experience in a Chromebook like one. No installs, never outdated software. Just a yearly subscription contribution to worry about.
