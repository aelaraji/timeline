2022-12-21T08:40:00Z	(#6ek4rvq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I’ll have a look. 👌
2022-12-21T08:40:18Z	My feed just got rotated as well. Let me know if it broke something. 🥴
2022-12-21T08:48:54Z	(#g67crtq) Hmm, looks like my reply to this thread (the one with the link to nature.com) got lost: https://twtxt.net/conv/xjgwpsa
2022-12-21T09:18:27Z	(#g67crtq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I do. But didn’t we work out some logic to cover this case? 🤔 I forgot. Something like: “If the current file does not contain the twt hash that we’ve seen on the last run, then traverse back through archived feeds until you find it.” 🤔
2022-12-21T09:21:47Z	(#6ek4rvq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> btw, dev.twtxt.net could use an update. 😅  This page, for example, still shows the old version: https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/twtsubjectextension.html
2022-12-21T10:21:48Z	(#g67crtq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Oof. 😅 Yeah, maybe I souldn’t truncate it entirely … let’s see if I can conjure up the motivation to implement that. 😅
2022-12-22T17:25:36Z	(#kwuzqla) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Weather is crazy, yeah. I’m glad that it’s no longer -10°C, though. 🥴  That 04.jpg is wallpaper-worthy! 👌
2022-12-22T19:03:03Z	(#ifngerq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> Nice. (My machine is not fast enough to render this smoothly, though. 🥴)
2022-12-23T10:51:20Z	(#kz2taka) As of today, the noisy drying machines are gone! 🥳 Best christmas present in a long time. 🥴
2022-12-23T12:15:20Z	(#kz2taka) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Dry, yeah. Nice, not yet. 😅  Some stuff needs to be rebuilt/repainted now. But that’s not a big deal.  @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Close to a month. 🥴 🤦
2022-12-23T16:02:26Z	Advent of Code in a nutshell:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGtz-_da0o  😂
2022-12-23T16:02:57Z	(#ft34wyq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> That is some juicy green, though. Isn’t it *winter*?
2022-12-23T16:15:09Z	I just read that some parts of the US currently have up/down to -40°C. Oh my goodness. 😳
2022-12-24T04:30:27Z	(#kz2taka) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I’m afraid 3-4 weeks is rather short. 🫤  Depending on how big the damage is, these machines might be around for much longer.  My damage was a minor damage, I think. It also was in the *drain* (not even nasty toilet sewage), so there was only water coming down to me when the upstairs neighbors used their shower. It wasn’t running non-stop.   And still, it caused a lot of trouble and headache. I don’t even want to imagine a big damage where an under-pressure pipe bursts. 😨😨😨  Let’s hope this never happens while I live here. 🤞
2022-12-25T08:53:06Z	(#6nabnda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Family stuff, lots of family stuff, then some more family stuff. 🤣  (Eating, drinking, sitting, being unhealthy. Yay!)
2022-12-25T09:50:48Z	Finished Advent of Code and rejoined the private leaderboards out of curiosity -- only to find out that the other people stopped doing the puzzles halfway through. 🥴
2022-12-25T09:50:58Z	(#6bxoatq) Summary of the event: gopher://uninformativ.de/0/phlog/2022-12/2022-12-25--advent-of-code-2022.txt
2022-12-26T06:03:52Z	(#qjljwza) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Nice 😂
2022-12-26T06:24:09Z	(#m2n5vzq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> What was that? “Too bad the computer can’t read indentation”? 🐍😏
2022-12-26T07:01:02Z	(#m2n5vzq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Oh, right, that’s the same! 😳
2022-12-29T09:24:42Z	(#d5dkd2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Should have been called `gitxt.git`. 😈
2022-12-29T16:24:37Z	(#uxjvuxa) For the record, I think this is spartan:  https://github.com/michael-lazar/spartan  When I searched for “spartan protocol”, the first result was some crypto currency nonsense. 🤦
2022-12-31T16:49:18Z	(#bf44ima) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Niiice! 👌  Now get ready for a nifty little war simulation! 🥳  Err, I mean, guten Rutsch!
2023-01-01T17:29:42Z	(#bf44ima) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Fireworks sure do look nice, though. 😅 I’m surprised that you managed to take such good shots – it’s pretty finnicky to get the exposure right, IIRC. (I guess your camera had good auto-settings here.)  We were watching from our balcony. Well, not the balcony actually, we were behind the windows. You can’t watch fireworks from the balcony of a (small-ish) tower building, because the rockets will explode right in your face. 🧨  Where I live, it has actually gotten a bit better. Before Covid, people were shooting fireworks like maniacs. Then in 2020 there were basically no fireworks (I think there were restrictions back then), which was a little strange, but very relaxing. In 2021, some fireworks got replaced by laser shows – pretty cool! And this year we’re back to standard fireworks again – but not to the pre-Covid extent. They stopped sooner and I hardly remember any bombs going off today (January 1st).
2023-01-01T17:30:50Z	(#36xvvca) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Quite a lot of bugs in that area. 🤔  I mean in general, not just in your client. What was it? Sometimes it almost feels like we went too far with that spec and made it too complicated / too many corner cases.
2023-01-02T13:30:43Z	(#trmql3q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Cleaning the browser’s profile on every reboot helps a lot. 🥴
2023-01-02T14:37:03Z	(#trmql3q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I don’t. 😅 I might accumulate quite a lot of tabs throughout the day (especially at work), but eventually, meh, hardly any of them matter. If something really is important, I store a link at the appropriate place. Let’s say some web site is relevant to a bit of code I’m writing, then it ends up as a comment in said code …  Other than that, I have a bookmarks file with stuff I’m regularly visiting.  And that’s it.  Which brings me to the important question: What *are* those 153 tabs of yours? 😅
2023-01-02T14:57:14Z	[The Fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(TV_series)) is a great show. 👌 Slow, dark, great atmosphere. Almost like Nordic Noir. I haven’t finished it yet, though (so who knows, maybe the ending sucks 😅).
2023-01-02T15:01:04Z	(#trmql3q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Huh … well, to be fair, I do have a “read later” text file. I never read any of the stuff in it, but maybe, one day, when I have the time … 🤪  If you don’t read it now (or at least this evening), then you probably never will.
2023-01-02T16:06:20Z	[Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)) as a self-hosted chat for our family was a mistake. Messages even arrive out of order now …  I’ll have to start looking for an alternative.
2023-01-02T19:44:39Z	(#jpn5wua) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> I’ll have a look at the current state of XMPP and that list, thanks. 👌
2023-01-03T07:11:13Z	(#4azhjsq) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Hmm, I’m just seeing this: https://movq.de/v/d28ab7e453/s.png
2023-01-03T07:23:18Z	(#jpn5wua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I have to confess, I never really had a look at Salty. 🤔 Is it ready for “prime time”? I.e., usable by non-tech users, Android and iOS client, easy upload of images and videos, … ?
2023-01-03T08:14:27Z	(#jpn5wua) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> They hardly care what it is. It should just work. They’re also an WhatsApp, but I refuse to use that. 🥴
2023-01-03T17:17:24Z	Moon and Mars very close to each other tonight.  ![](https://movq.de/v/880202b838/s.png)  Sadly, I lack the equipment/skill to take a good photo of this. The Moon is way too bright and you can hardly see Mars on the left.  ![](https://movq.de/v/74826b2534/s.png)
2023-01-04T18:57:19Z	(#w346hia) @<mckinley https://mckinley.cc/twtxt.txt> I thought it was going to be the year of IPv6?
2023-01-06T17:06:00Z	(#mf4kvaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I’m not really sure what you mean. Don’t we already have `nick =` and `url =` in the metadata section? Which problem are we trying to solve? 🤔
2023-01-06T17:59:56Z	(#o33cpoq) @<logout http://i-logout.cz/twtxt.txt> Which books did you read? Are they available online by any chance?
2023-01-07T04:58:22Z	(#o33cpoq) @<logout http://i-logout.cz/twtxt.txt> Nice, thank you.
2023-01-07T05:05:39Z	(#mf4kvaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hmmm.  So you’re suggesting to make `prologic@twtxt.net` the “primary identifier” of a user, right? That’s the string that I would configure in my twtxt client when I want to follow someone. Then when my client fetches the feed, it first does a webfinger lookup to find the feed URL and the nickname. (Or maybe this only immediately after adding the user to my client and then maybe update it every now and then.)  Did I understand correctly so far? 😅
2023-01-07T06:17:44Z	(#mf4kvaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Alright, buuuut … what do we gain from that?  You could do almost the same thing currently with just the feed URL. `nick =` can be read from metadata. The canonical feed URL used for twt hashing is well-defined, too (first `url =` in metadata).  Sorry if I’m being too dumb. 😅
2023-01-07T08:17:22Z	(#mf4kvaa) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Hmmm … if the argument is “not all twtxt files have all required fields”, then wouldn’t this also apply to webfinger? Not all servers that host a twtxt file will also serve webfinger info. 🤔 You’d probably always have to implement some fallback mechanism.  I don’t really know anything about “indieweb”, though. I’ll have to read up on that first. 😅
2023-01-09T17:36:56Z	Why, oh why, does YouTube include *upcoming* videos in RSS feeds? “This video premiers in 21 hours.” Oohhhhhhkay. I will long have forgotten about it by then, thank you very much.
2023-01-09T20:30:09Z	(#dusjj6a) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> What? It’s the same in the YouTube app?! 😂  Okay, then … whatever. 🤷🤦
2023-01-09T20:31:38Z	Looking forward to the bass lesson for My Sleeping Karma - Ephedra: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H22lajS4GE #NowPlaying 👌😍
2023-01-09T20:32:56Z	(#xmu3c7a) (That’s a video that will … premier in … *20 days*! 🤣 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBJtnCZHPxM I guess that’s the whole point of this “feature”. It’s so ridiculous that people just *have* to talk about it. And boom, marketing.)
2023-01-10T15:21:00Z	(#dusjj6a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Good point. Turns out, they *are* available in the web UI:  ![](https://movq.de/v/b57bee8387/s.png)  So, yeah, probably nobody uses feeds, so they don’t notice how inconvenient this is …  Ugh, I really don’t want to build a queue for this. 😅
2023-01-11T20:42:37Z	This struck a nerve: gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/~solderpunk/gemlog/orphans-of-netscape.gmi
2023-01-13T15:59:52Z	(#pq3g2oq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> Well, I can relate quite a bit to this idea of “Orphans of Netscape”. I can’t really put it into words. 😅  Just “yeah, that’s it!”
2023-01-14T16:14:06Z	(#i6td62a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, the second picture is a photo: https://movq.de/v/74826b2534/s.png Mars is on the left. It’s tiny, though, maybe you can’t spot it. 🤔
2023-01-16T14:41:09Z	Tea, Earl Grey, hot. ☕
2023-01-16T14:54:15Z	(#qy3odxa) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Ah, you’re back. 👌  I was *this close* to removing your presumably dead feed from my list. 😅
2023-01-16T14:58:35Z	(#q6rwseq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Oh, I love Voyager. 😁 Probably my favorite Star Trek series. Just finished re-watching it for the n-th time recently.  I just don’t have good coffee here at home. 🥴  (I’m not a coffee nerd.)
2023-01-16T15:03:36Z	I had no idea that there were VMs in Windows 3: https://xtof.info/inside-windows3.html
2023-01-16T19:16:58Z	Welch wundervolle Comics: https://mastodon.social/@kplx/media
2023-01-17T20:03:05Z	(#wwc44pq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yup, implementing stuff like that is way more complicated and annoying than one might think. 🤔
2023-01-18T18:52:35Z	(#6ao3moq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Sigh. 🫤  As much as I love C for its (apparent) simplicity, we should really abandon it and these classes of bugs with it. (Rust or Go are not the answer, though, imho.)
2023-01-18T18:52:48Z	(#6ao3moq) (Yay, programming language discussion! 😅)
2023-01-20T15:12:28Z	(#ukxztdq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> NOPE! Still work tomorrow. 😂  (Network maintenance in one of our offices.)
2023-01-20T15:15:21Z	(#2lf3mmq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> For traffic flow, it doesn’t matter which sides initiates the connection. The only thing that matters here: Do you have a static IP at home? If not, then you will want to initiate the connection from your home to your server.
2023-01-20T15:23:57Z	(#y52r2ca) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Awwww, you got snow! ☃️  (Brass at a funeral? Odd, to me at least.)
2023-01-20T15:25:54Z	(#eqcmvja) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> https://www.passwordstore.org/ here as well. 👌

2023-01-20T15:58:02Z	(#cdrrj4q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Yeah, not everybody likes this genre. 😅

2023-01-20T19:59:04Z	(#eqcmvja) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>  > One major gripe I have with `pass` is that it is way, way, way too easy to end up with your passwords displayed on the screen in cleartext.  Huh, that never happened to me. 🤔  Not accidentally, I mean.  I do use a frontend, though: https://uninformativ.de/git/padme  (Just a slight tweak of the default `passmenu`.)
2023-01-21T06:10:58Z	(#3suu3oa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Not anymore – luckily, because I have to drive to the office today. 😅
2023-01-21T08:37:06Z	(#lnbbpzq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Hmm, I see what you mean. 🤔  From a “UNIX” point of view, the current behavior feels correct. By default, print to stdout. If you want something else, then you have to specify a flag. That’s what a lot of UNIX tools do.  Now, it’s up for debate if this kind of behavior is appropriate for a password manager. 😅
2023-01-21T08:46:39Z	(#lnbbpzq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I suspect that people _might_ argue: “If we change the default behavior, then a ton of tools will have to be updated as well, so we can’t do that.” One way to alleviate this issue could be: Have `pass show` refuse to print clear text passwords *if `stdout` is a terminal*. 🤔
2023-01-21T08:47:54Z	(#mu3gdja) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Aww. 😅
2023-01-21T08:55:25Z	Yeah, little buddy, I’m not happy, either.  ![](https://movq.de/v/20b8b75ef0/s.png)
2023-01-21T09:13:42Z	(#lnbbpzq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Then we’ll add a `pass --force show` or something. 🥴
2023-01-21T16:27:36Z	(#jkjr52a) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> Yep, it means “the air is too dry” and/or “it’s too cold”. 😅
2023-01-21T20:36:20Z	(#jkjr52a) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> You gotta be kidding, this has got to be the outside temperature, right?! 🤪
2023-01-22T07:14:30Z	(#idjvp3a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> “Voi vittu” indeed. 😂
2023-01-23T18:57:35Z	Picking up calligraphy as a hobby again – after a long break. The result isn’t great, but better than I expected. Maybe this is a bit like riding a bike, you don’t unlearn it. 😅  [![https://movq.de/v/2340e9d444/f.jpg](https://movq.de/v/2340e9d444/.html-index-thumb-f.jpg.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/2340e9d444/f.jpg)  (Clickable thumbnail.)

2023-01-24T19:44:58Z	(#bg5h3dq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> They are very similar, yes, but I’ve also been sloppy. 😅 “u” should be connected at the bottom, “n” at the top. Here’s a better example from 2018:  https://movq.de/v/82bcbb7b92/eugen.jpg  I also like that capital “E” much better, hmm.
2023-01-25T17:17:59Z	(#bg5h3dq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I don’t remember, to be honest. 🤔  I was probably browsing random images on imgur.com and saw someone doing it, so I thought to myself: “Hey, that’s cool, I always liked that, so let’s just buy a pen and some nibs.” 😅 Luckily, that equipment isn’t very expensive … It was just 20 bucks, so why not just give it a shot.
2023-01-25T20:36:33Z	(#bg5h3dq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I use ink pots:  https://movq.de/v/f75e6597bb/1.jpg (oops, 5 MB image)  The nibs are pretty simple:  https://movq.de/v/f75e6597bb/2.jpg (5 MB)  A small amount of ink gets trapped in that little “hook” there. (Dunno how to describe it, that’s what I mean: https://movq.de/v/304d99e6cd/2-2.jpg) Depending on the size of the nib, this lasts for about, hmm, maybe half a line? You have to re-dip quite often, which can be a bit annoying. Then again, it’s not a big issue, because the whole process is super slow anyway. When I was writing birthday cards this way, I think it took about 30-45 minutes to write one card with a couple of lines on it.  It’s a matter of practice to make it uniform – and it also depends on the type of ink. “Scabiosa” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_gall_ink) is not very uniform, it’s the purple-ish stuff in the upper half (I probably ran out of ink on “Xerox” and was too lazy to re-dip):  https://movq.de/v/f75e6597bb/3.jpg (6 MB)  The lower half is some other ink, much more uniform.  Those little ink pots last a really, really long time, by the way. This is the one that I’ve been using the most throughout the years, and there’s still quite a bit left:  https://movq.de/v/f75e6597bb/4.jpg  I often thought about buying a pen with an integrated cartridge, but I think that it’s better with ink pots. It’s super easy to clean, nothing ever clogs up or dries out. And you can easily switch to another type of ink without much hassle:  https://movq.de/v/71d33691c0/g.jpg
2023-01-26T08:06:17Z	(#4jsfxfa) @<eldersnake https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> It is a joke.  ``` $ mkdir foo && cd foo $ cargo init      Created binary (application) package $ cargo run    Compiling ach v0.1.0 (/tmp/tmp/ach)     Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.17s      Running `target/debug/ach` Hello, world! $ cat src/main.rs fn main() {     println!("Hello, world!"); } $ ```  (Yes, a “hello world” is the default code created by `cargo init`.)
2023-01-26T17:04:59Z	(#bg5h3dq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> Thanks 😅 To be fair, though, I think it’s easier to write Fraktur than normal handwriting. First, as I said, I’m doing it super slow. Second, that pen/nib has much more “friction” on the paper than a regular pen.

I just wanted to leave this “+1” here, because your post shouldn’t drown in the noise, thus falsly creating the impression that nobody cares or that people silently disagree with you.
2023-02-03T17:53:14Z	I’ve been to the office almost every day for the last 5 weeks (debugging WiFi in our various buildings) and it really took a toll on me. I’m exhausted. It’s so much overhead to drive to the office, a ridiculous waste of resources and time. How did we ever consider this normal? 😨  Not one traffic jam, though. Looks like lots of people are still working from home as well. Put another way: Back in the day, it took *even longer* to get to the office due to bad traffic! Oof.

2023-02-25T18:34:29Z	I’m not doing a lot of computer stuff lately, hence it’s a bit quiet over here.  Instead, I’m spending more time fiddling with music and audio stuff. Latest gadget, an additional microphone for my electric upright bass:  [Photo (1.6 MB)](https://movq.de/v/98c97d69ed/photo.jpg)  More expensive instruments often have such a microphone builtin, but not mine, since I went for the cheapest model available. 🤪  Normally, mine only has a piezo pickup, which sounds like this (headphones advised for all of these clips):  [raw_pickup.flac (1.7 MB)](https://movq.de/v/98c97d69ed/raw_pickup.flac)  It’s pretty dull, especially when using the bow. So, with that additional mic and some reverb, I now get this:  [mix.flac (3.6 MB)](https://movq.de/v/98c97d69ed/mix.flac)  Much better. I’m not 100% happy with the result, but it’s a big improvement nonetheless.  The mic alone sounds like this:  [raw_mic.flac (2 MB)](https://movq.de/v/98c97d69ed/raw_mic.flac)  … and of course, I’m still learning how to play this thing properly. 😅  Using the bow is pretty hard.

2023-03-11T10:08:25Z	I never owned a coffee maker, because … I don’t really know exactly 😅, but one of the reasons is that I’m too lazy to properly clean and maintain these machines. So, I was just drinking tea at home and coffee only at the office (where we have big fancy machines). Recently, a friend told me about a super simple way to make coffee:  ![](https://movq.de/v/8950977b94/s.png)  Put in a filter, put in the coffee, pour water over it, done. The only “machine” required is something to heat up the water. Hardly any cleaning involved.  I love this low-tech approach.  Now I just have to learn more about it, buy better beans and all that. 😅

2023-04-15T15:51:04Z	(#pud4w2q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Many (most?) licenses in the world of free software explicitly deny any liability (is that how you say it in English? I think you know what I mean). So, if a user still uses that software for “potentially dangerous” things, who’s to blame? The software? Or the user?  We Germans always have to make an analogy with cars 😅, so here you go: If there’s a guy on the street offering you a car and he says, “oh, maybe it’ll drive, maybe it’ll explode, who knows – either way, the risk is yours, I’m just offering it”, you might still be interested in using that car for certain things. But you wouldn’t use it as an ambulance car or a taxi or whatever. Or you might actually do that after carefully inspecting it and/or fixing some things.  So, if there actually are any liability issues here in the current laws – I know nothing about that field, especially not when it comes to *corporations* –, I think this should be fixed at the user’s end. You run a hospital? Then there are certain standards for you and you’re liable for certain things. If that implies that you can no longer use, say, nginx, then that’s not nginx’s problem, but yours.  I would argue that you *cannot* hold programmers liable if they contribute to a free software project that is publicly available, because you don’t know how this software is going to be used.  (Plus, I have a hard time imagining how you as a programmer could prove that you’ve done a good job. What’s the criterium here? Clearly, it can’t be “no bugs ever”. So, what is it, “no damage above 1000 dollars” or something like that? What does the EU thingy say here?)
2023-04-15T16:30:16Z	(#pud4w2q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>  > Firstly, contributing software to an open source project cannot be a blanket "get out of jail free" card. That's a sociopathic stance, on its face, and just cannot be accepted.  I don’t understand. Why is that sociopathic? (Language barrier here? I really don’t get what you mean.)  > But thirdly, […] And the same should happen in software. […]  How do you *really know* if a project has been used in dangerous situations? (If this changes in the future, are programmers that contributed in the past – when this project was not yet used in dangerous situations – also liable?)
2023-04-15T16:36:47Z	(#76auj3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Looks like here’s a markdown rendering bug. That last part (“How do you *really know* …”) is not part of the quoted text. 🤔
2023-04-15T17:44:24Z	(#pud4w2q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>  Yeah, we probably have to agree to disagree here.  I still think it would be better to put the burden of liability on the users – no matter if they’re private individuals or big companies. (And isn’t that already the case? Do we even have to solve a *legal liability problem*? Not talking about software quality here, that’s a whole other issue.)  > Trust me, if people got sued or went to jail, the tech industry would figure out really fast how to make these determinations.  Yeah, they would. It’s simple: No more free software, no more publicly available projects. The only software that would ever exist is software made by large corporations who can afford the appropriate insurances and lawyers.  What you’re proposing is either classifying software in advance as “dangerous” or “harmless” (I’d argue that’s impossible – as an extreme, think of libraries, they’d *all* be “potentially dangerous”), or threatening free software projects with lawsuits if, at some point in the future, these projects caused an accident.  Why would anyone publish free software or contribute to it under these conditions?  > Why should open source software development be any different?  IMHO because you can make software publicly available and anyone can use it for whatever they want, which the author has zero control over.  Anyway, have a good night, I’m gonna enjoy a couple of movies now. 👋 😊
2023-04-15T19:18:14Z	(#pud4w2q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>  Seatbelts and cars are so much simpler than software. It is easy to see that you might crash your car into a tree and that a belt will help you here (if you’re going slow enough, yadda yadda).  If I write a library for a compression algorithm, how can I ever prepare for someone using this in, I don’t know, a medical device in a hospital, but then my code has a bug, crashes that device and a person dies? There are so many more indirections here than with cars and seatbelts. It is completely out of my control.  Anyway, I think we both made our points clear. I’m out, cheers! 👋 🥃

The content that we all have in our feeds really is much closer to a web forum or usenet or whatever. It’s threaded conversations. twtxt, as I *believe* it was originally intended, are short little status updates – that’s it. The formats of Yarn.social and twtxt might be very similar, but the content is vastly different and, in a way, incompatible. (As such, I *think* I understand very well that the original twtxt crowd is disgruntled.)  That proposed truncated feed doesn’t really provide any value, if you ask me. 🤔 It’d just be chaotic.

2023-05-02T15:18:25Z	Quite funny how language evolves. Yesterday, I explained the word “podcast” to family members. Nobody had any idea what it actually means or where it came from. It just popped up in our media here in Germany like 10 years ago. Just, boom, “podcast”. 😅
2023-05-02T18:59:19Z	(#gb2rhka) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> To my knowledge, it’s a combination of the words “iPod” and “broadcast”. You don’t “cast your content broadly out into the open”, but you “cast it onto an iPod”. Something like that.  I just had a look at the german wikipedia and they explain it a bit differently (at least at the top of the page), saying that “pod” means “play on demand”. I never heard that one before. 😅  Also found this short interview with the guy who coined the term:  https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p038m811  So, apparently, there wasn’t much thinking involved. 🥴  It’s just “broadcast” but on an iPod, so it’s a “podcast” …

It also appears to be much less crowded than over here (I’d never dare to take a leak in “the woods”, there’s always someone around 😅).

For *that*, it was very important to run the app.

2023-05-09T13:31:43Z	Speaking of Rust: I talked to a Rust enthusiast the other day. She said she’s pretty satisfied with Rust’s comprehensive standard library. I was just like: “Huh?!” In my experience, you need a third-party library for pretty much anything.  Sadly, that discussion was not very fruitful, because I didn’t have any examples at hand. 🫤  So, from now on, every time I encounter something that, IMHO, should be in the standard library, I’ll add it to a list. 😅  Let’s see how long that list will get – or, who knows, maybe it’ll stay a short list because I was wrong.
2023-05-09T16:07:40Z	I bought my current noise cancelling headphones (Bose QC 25) in 2015, that’s a whopping 8 years ago.

The sound you’re hearing happens roughly every 2 minutes, 5am thru 11pm, when the wind is right (it often is in summer). They tried to extend this to 24/7 around 15 years ago, but failed, luckily.  Okay, I get it. The crows can be annoying (especially if you don’t like birds – I happen to love them, so I’m biased).

How else would you know where to tap?”  Total bliss. That feeling of “oh, I know, that’s a button that I can click” is completely lost to newer generations of computer users. Modern UIs have so little indication of *what kind of elements* are shown on the screen and *what you can do with them* that users just … try every pixel. Tap here, swipe there, see what happens. Is this really a good way to do UIs? Am I just old and grumpy?)

2023-06-09T07:56:56Z	Enjoying a day off, sitting on the balcony in some nice 18°C. 👌  Random photos: https://movq.de/v/863829c893  Here’s a massive image (5928x24180, 12 MB JPG) showing many of the planes that flew by: https://movq.de/v/34a6d39baa/montage.jpg
2023-06-09T08:09:34Z	(#6ykol7q) (btw: There are two parallel runways on the airport but, from that balcony, I can only see the planes that approach one of them. So this is roughly *half* of the planes arriving here.)

2023-06-10T13:17:15Z	Ah, damn … I have that nice [split keyboard](https://www.uninformativ.de/blog/postings/2020-12-05/0/POSTING-en.html), which I really love (I use it more than my Model M 😅), but it’s actually *two* USB devices. Wayland compositors usually struggle with this. 😢 When Wayland really hits big time, I’ll have to look for another model … Let’s hope the keyboard just breaks in the meantime, otherwise it’s gonna feel a little bit frustrating.

2023-06-11T15:41:14Z	A GTK 4 application showing an empty window uses about 160 MB of RAM:      $ wget https://movq.de/v/138ab3e622/win.c     $ cc -Wall -Wextra -o win win.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk4)     $ ./win  It also takes several seconds to start on my machine because it is compiling shaders and initializing DRI (it’s faster on the second run, unless you happen to lose `~/.cache/mesa_shader_cache/`). This might be a hint as to why it’s using so much memory: There’s obviously much more going on behind the scenes these days, not just a little bit of internal housekeeping and then creating a window.
2023-06-12T13:15:39Z	(#roe77la) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I had a look last night. Mars is much more faint than I expected. I could hardly see it with my bare eyes and it’s not much better on photos:  https://movq.de/v/e682fc642d/IMG_5009-annotated.jpg (5184x3456, 4.8 MB)
2023-06-12T13:16:29Z	(#sq5r2yq) @<thiegui https://texto-plano.xyz/~thiegui/twtxt.txt> Yeah, crap.
2023-06-12T17:05:26Z	(#owvsdgq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Yes, that appears to be the case. I stumbled upon `GSK_RENDERER=cairo` a while ago – it helps with the startup times and a little bit with memory consumption, which is down to about 130 MB.  Still quite heavy and startup times are noticeably longer than GTK 3. It’s not *that* much, but it’s there.  In my case, I wanted to port [xiate](https://uninformativ.de/git/xiate) from GTK 3 to GTK 4. But that much memory usage for just one terminal window (of which there are usually *many*, so we’re talking about gigabytes here) is too much. GTK might have its use cases, but I think it’s no longer the right toolkit for me.  I don’t want to hate on it too much. I know too little of the internal details of all this, so I don’t have an informed opinion.  (Before anyone suggests it: Yes, I could have *one* process show many terminal windows. That would be a lot faster and would use a lot less memory. But I explicitly do not want that. `xiate` used to have this model – until one day at work, a bug in the terminal library VTE crashed all my terminal windows at once. It really only crashed one *window*, but since they all ran in the same *process*, they were all gone. This is unacceptable.)
2023-06-12T17:17:18Z	(#owvsdgq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  > Have we really gotten that lazy and inefficient? 🤔  That’s the question. It certainly strikes me as odd that everything keeps getting bigger, heavier, slower all the time. But why is that? I refuse to believe that this is just incompetence. 😅
2023-06-13T19:01:46Z	The day will come when I’ll have to dig up *why* every process can interact with every other process’s file descriptors by means of `/proc/$pid/fd` on Linux (if it’s the same user). Is there a legitimate reason for that … ? (I know about `hidepid`, but that doesn’t help here.)
2023-06-14T03:58:51Z	(#gzzdgpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hmm. That would require me to put each and every process into its own namespace, wouldn’t it? I don’t think that’s practical. 🤔 Or maybe I’m misunderstanding.  I’ve never really thought about this, to be honest. There’s no procfs on the BSDs, so I guess that a) it’s not really necessary, b) there should be plenty of rants from BSD users on this issue that I could read. 😅
2023-06-14T16:55:13Z	(#gzzdgpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hmm, I’ll have to look into it. 🤔 Probably not what I meant, but interesting nontheless. 👍

2023-06-17T16:21:06Z	(#qqefk2a) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Almost makes me want to do some 3D stuff again, too. 😅 It’s been a while … Maybe it’s better to wait for Winter, though, my machine might overheat. 🥵
2023-06-17T16:25:25Z	Once more, I’m toying with [st](https://st.suckless.org). I actually might switch for real this time. My GTK/VTE terminal does work quite well (as long as I don’t port it from GTK 3 to GTK 4), but dealing with the nitty gritty details in st is just way more interesting. 😅
2023-06-17T20:40:28Z	(#hhv3gxa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> The planes like to land “against the wind”. When it’s coming from east, they approach from west towards east (and thus fly over me) – and vice versa. When it’s coming from west, they *take off* towards west, which, for some reason, is quieter than landing. 🥴  Maybe they just climb faster than they descend, I don’t know.
2023-06-17T20:57:07Z	(#zoc3ena) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> To my surprise, st has builtin zoom. 🤯  I use that very often, too.  But vanilla st lacks other features that I, personally, find essential. For example a scrollback buffer. (That’s a very controversial topic in that community …) What you have to do, is go through this list and pick patches that you like:  https://st.suckless.org/patches/  Of course, they don’t all apply cleanly or are outright buggy sometimes, because anyone can push a patch to that list. There’s not really a strong review process.  At the end of the day, when you’re using st, you’re very likely effectively forking it. I’m not entirely sure yet if I’m up for that. 😅  Why do that anyway? Just for the fun of tinkering with it. 😅  The good thing is that upstream development has slowed down considerably in the last few years. It appears to be much more stable these days. Running my own st fork might actually be doable. We’ll see.
2023-06-18T06:09:28Z	(#hhv3gxa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> That sounds plausible. :)  Plus, when they depart, they sometimes turn very quickly and don’t even fly over my head.
2023-06-18T06:23:36Z	(#zoc3ena) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Going over the list of their projects, I think mainly dwm and st fall in that category. I also use a few others (dmenu, farbfeld, slock, xssstate, in the past also tabbed) which can be used “as is”. Granted, though, these are also *much* simpler. 😅
2023-06-18T08:26:49Z	(#zoc3ena) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Oh, wmii, I totally forgot about that one. :D That was a long, long time ago … I never used wmi, though.
2023-06-18T09:39:31Z	(#zoc3ena) (When it comes to the suckless project, though, I just don’t know how to deal with this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Suckless.org :/ It’s all left a bit ambiguous and there’s never been a clear statement, afaik. Makes me uncomfortable, sorry.)
2023-06-19T13:09:28Z	(#zoc3ena) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Someone told me in a conversation a few years back. (I only found that link to wikipedia yesterday and it appeared to be a good starting point. 😅)  Yes, there’s always disagreement. But there are some things that I don’t want to tolerate/ignore. Also, there’s a difference between “it’s good software, I use it” and “hey, nice community, I want to be a part of it”.

2023-06-21T18:16:17Z	Had my first upright bass lesson today! 🥳 I love this instrument. I also got to play an acoustic upright bass for a little bit (mine is electric) – what a beast. 😅
2023-06-21T18:23:54Z	After having used st as my main terminal for a while now:  -   Most things work just like in xiate, but I did patch st heavily. Took quite some time to do this, but it was also fun, so it was worth it. -   st uses much less memory than xiate (12-20 MB for st, 40 MB+ for xiate) – but *way more* CPU time. 😅 When I move another window on top of an st window (so that st has to do a lot of redraws), the CPU spikes so much that my whole X server begins to stutter. -   There’s no point in denying it: Font rendering is way better in xiate, because it can use the whole GTK-Pango-Whatever stuff. That’s a lot of code and could arguably be viewed as “bloat”, but the results are also better. Font stuff is not trivial, it’s inherently complex.

2023-06-24T08:38:00Z	TIL: There appear to be different whitespace collapsing rules in XML that – at least some of the parsers we used – don’t agree on.

2023-06-28T15:29:25Z	Got new rosin for my bass. Until now, I was using the no-name stuff that came with the instrument. Wow, what a difference. It finally feels like the bow actually *works*. 😳  Besides, it smells really good. 😅

The Android ecosystem is so ridiculously fucked up in that regard. Especially when you buy cheap Android phones, they are pretty much guaranteed to never receive updates … I almost think this should be illegal.

2023-06-29T16:19:39Z	(#c4apodq) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> Oh wow. 🤔  Let’s see how well that works in practice.  (I’d still prefer it if smartphones/tablets were more like the PC world, where installing arbitrary OSes is the norm: Nobody stops me from running a current Linux distro on my 15 year old machine.

2023-06-30T10:05:13Z	(#p5h6lpa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Ya, that’s a few extra steps, though, and it’s extra-extra work if you’re not running Yarn. On Mastodon, this appears to be the norm. 🤔
2023-06-30T10:38:02Z	(#c4apodq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> To elaborate a bit more:  I’m a control freak and a tinkerer. Almost everything I do in the realm of computers is about understanding how it works and being able to tweak it. I rarely care about “just getting things done”.  And I’m tired of fighting. Sure, what I want to do *might be possible* on macOS or Windows or Android or whatever – but those systems are not *meant* to be used like I want to. On the other hand, Linux and BSD give me all the tools I need and they don’t get in my way (usually – OpenBSD can be quite opinionated).  Smartphones and tablets are a lost cause to me. Most manufacturers obviously hate it if the user is in control of anything, so they lock it all down. Android is the lesser evil (last time I tried it wasn’t *that hard* to write your Android app, but that was like 10 years ago) and it offers you slightly more options than iOS (simple things like settings your own ringtone …), but it’s still not something that I enjoy using.  More: gopher://uninformativ.de/0/phlog/2021-08/2021-08-25--the-ideal-smartphone.txt

2023-07-07T19:04:47Z	12 years ago, I (re)installed Linux on my machine:      $ head -n 1 /var/log/pacman.log      [2011-07-07 11:19] installed filesystem (2011.04-1)  I believe that was the day when I switched from i686 to amd64. It was on an Athlon 64 X2 4200+. I bought it in 2006 and I could have run amd64 right from the start but didn’t, for some reason. I was pretty late to the party.  Since then, just rolling updates. It’s not the same machine anymore, the system has been moved to/through various hard disks and SSDs over time. Quite a long time and this stability still surprises me.  (I wonder why I never followed that approach during my days with Windows. It should have worked, I think? But for some reason, completely wiping the disk on every Windows update or major hardware upgrade was “the way to go” back then … Or *did* I try and everything broke horribly? 🤔 I honestly don’t remember anymore.)

Also, even though that Wikipedia article only shows *external* drives, we had *internal* LS120 drives. So, unlike the ZIP drive, the LS120 really was a backwards compatible thing and you could use it just like a normal floppy disk drive. (Plus, at 120 MB, it was a little larger than ZIP at 100 MB.)  For a very brief moment, it looked like LS120 was the new “standard”. 😅  IIRC, they even put them in pre-assembled PCs that you could buy in shops (anyone remember “Vobis”?). It quickly became irrelevant, though, since CD-RWs offered a much larger capacity soon after …  > Do you still listen to that old file every now and then or do just keep it around for sentimental value?  Nah, it’s just one of the many old files that I still have lying around. 😅  (I don’t really listen to that kind of music anymore, tbh.)

2023-07-10T17:06:10Z	(#xi7qz6q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Clicking is the reason why I’m not using a vertical mouse: You have to “pinch” the mouse between thumb and index finger (or ring ringer for the right button). I find that to be pretty exhausting over time. With a regular “horizontal” mouse, you can almost use gravity to issue a click. 😅  Requires much less energy.  But other than that, vertical mice are much more comfortable …
2023-07-10T19:31:18Z	(#zzremrq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Now that’s rare, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like that. 😲  Very thick atmosphere, eh …

2023-07-11T15:29:57Z	(#2id47na) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> As an outsider, I don’t really have an opinion on this (other than: twtxt.net is quite confusing with all the Mastodon posts 😅), so: Why do you think that? 🤔
2023-07-11T15:31:05Z	PSA: You can hit “S” in Netflix to skip intros. 😅
2023-07-11T15:54:09Z	(#ow64kqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I can understand that. 😅  I’m this close to cancelling Netflix myself. There’s very little interesting content anymore (and it just doesn’t *hide* the stuff that I’ve already seen, which is very annoying).  (Amazon Video is much worse, IMHO, the usability is just horrible. And it constantly tries to nudge you into paying extra for something.)
2023-07-13T19:02:19Z	(#ccnlcjq) I don’t have IPv6 at home, either. (There are legends that I *might* be able to “upgrade” to get IPv6, but ISPs here in Germany are quite horrible and it’s better if you don’t have anything to do with them, as long as shit mostly works.)
2023-07-14T16:35:19Z	(#4dg2chq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Weeee! 🥳  Enjoy!
2023-07-14T17:35:13Z	I’ve been playing the X-Files theme quite often lately – maybe it’s time to rewatch the series! 😅  https://movq.de/v/d39298c085/xfiles-upright-bass.ogg (headphones advised, I’m not good at mixing/EQ – ignore the mistakes, shit’s hard)  Also, I’m getting more and more *comfortable* playing that instrument. Some beginner issues (posture, setup, and such) have been sorted out. In fact, I’m feeling way more comfortable on the upright bass now than on my bass guitar (maybe it’s just a matter of practice and technique, but, seriously, the overall body posture is just more *natural* on an upright bass – no weird twisting of the hands all the time; I’ve always hated that with any kind of guitar-like instrument).  I’m looking forward to taking more lessons, but I’ll have to wait another two months. 😢  Summer break and all that.

2023-07-15T13:45:21Z	(#ow64kqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hmm. What do you do with all the physical discs afterwards? 🤔
2023-07-16T16:50:24Z	Saw a real Eurasian Eagle-Owl today, for the first time. I knew that they are “large”, but I wasn’t aware just how big they are. Absolutely massive. 😅  [![Close-up of an Eurasian Eagle-Owl](https://www.uninformativ.de/pics/photo/birds/.gal-thumb-2023-07-16--IMG_5276-crop-curves.jpg.jpg)](https://www.uninformativ.de/pics/photo/birds/2023-07-16--IMG_5276-crop-curves.jpg)  (Since I’m an idiot, I only took photos with full zoom – so you can’t tell their size. 🤦)
2023-07-18T06:39:01Z	(#pbxeoba) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> A ringtone that sounds like an owl? Which one is that? 😅
2023-07-18T06:40:35Z	A bit of a Hitchcock moment this morning:  [![Lots of crows on a roof](https://movq.de/v/f0ac68b741/.html-index-thumb-IMG_5305.JPG.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/f0ac68b741/IMG_5305.JPG) [![More crows](https://movq.de/v/f0ac68b741/.html-index-thumb-IMG_5307.JPG.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/f0ac68b741/IMG_5307.JPG) [![Even more crows](https://movq.de/v/f0ac68b741/.html-index-thumb-IMG_5308.JPG.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/f0ac68b741/IMG_5308.JPG)
2023-07-18T18:41:08Z	(#pbxeoba) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Ohh, indeed! That does sound similar. 😅  Collared doves are quite rare around here. I think I only saw them once. 🤔  Thinking about it: I guess the big difference between the calls of owls and doves/pigeons is that owls don’t repeat their call that much. It’s more like a “huuuu!” and then silence for quite a while – whereas doves often sound like a broken record. 😂
2023-07-18T19:20:50Z	(#qc4zl3q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I guess that was their supper, hm? 😢

2023-07-19T13:44:40Z	Google turned Google Chat into … a forum. We’ve come full circle.
2023-07-19T14:59:25Z	(#xtrxhiq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I’ve posted a sample a few days ago, that’s gotta do! 😅 https://movq.de/v/d39298c085/xfiles-upright-bass.ogg
2023-07-20T04:44:37Z	(#nlo75va) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Haha. It didn’t grow at all, because I didn’t write a single line of Rust since then. 😢  I hardly wrote any code at all in the last few months, let alone start new projects that are worth being written in Rust (as opposed to “I can do this as a shellscript or in Python – mentally, Rust is a replacement for C for me).
2023-07-20T05:17:23Z	(#rpjvb7q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Also wir sind noch nicht durch damit (ISO27001), daher will ich mir da noch kein abschließendes Urteil erlauben und sollte eigentlich gar nicht so viel dazu schreiben. 😅  Aber was ich bisher so gesehen habe: *Eigentlich* ist das Regelwerk der ISO27001 gar nicht so schlecht, also die Gedanken darin/dahinter. (Natürlich kostet der Kram was, kannste also nicht mal einfach so reingucken.) Man könnte das schon als Grundlage nehmen, um sich mal die Firma anzugucken, was die so tut und wie sie das tut und dann tatsächlich Dinge verbessern.  Anders formuliert: Wenn du den Willen hast, dein Unternehmen zu verbessern, dann schau’ in die ISO27001 rein. Die gibt Ansatzpunkte und Ideen, an die du vielleicht gar nicht dachtest.  Wenn man das wirklich gewissenhaft macht und mehr als 5 Mitarbeitende hat, dann ist das aber ein *unfassbar* aufwändiger und schmerzhafter Vorgang. Ich kann mir beim besten Willen nicht vorstellen, dass die ganzen Unternehmen/Konzerne, die hübsch mit ISO27001-Zertifizierung werben, das auch so durchgezogen haben. No way. Und spätestens da fängt’s dann an, albern zu werden.
2023-07-22T06:36:43Z	(#qwghl5q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Nice shots indeed. 😊  Yesterday as well! (Fedora hats are in vogue again, aren’t they? 🤔)  The temperatures are very comfortable at the moment, yes. At least where we live – southern Europe not so much, I guess. 🫤

2023-07-22T06:49:36Z	(#rpjvb7q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Noch ein bisschen Stockholm-Syndrom: Die Kunden fragen ständig nach einer ISO27001-Zertifizierung, also hat es schon einen Nutzen™ das zu machen. :-)  Habt ihr schon einen Zeitplan, wann das bei euch losgeht? Und welche Zertifizierung wird’s? Ich bin schon ganz gespannt. 😅  #Selbsthilfegruppe
2023-07-22T06:50:34Z	„Löwe ist wohl ein Wildschwein“ ist auch eine gute Zusammenfassung der allgemeinen Sachlage.
2023-07-22T14:41:17Z	I'm looking for an old game from the mid 1990ies, probably DOS. (Not sure if it really existed or if I dreamed it up.)  Outdoors, alien planet, SciFi setting. 3D, voxelized landscape. The terrain was very open, you could move around freely. There was water in some parts of the terrain. You were piloting some sort of hovercraft or helicopter. I think you were also able to jump very high/far. There were few enemies and the entire gameplay was somewhat obscure -- I cannot remember the actual goal anymore, probably just "kill all enemies".  I think "energy balls" played an important part. I think they looked somewhat like the blue balls in "Descent" (those added energy to your shields), but I don't know anymore what their purpose was -- were those the projectiles you were shooting?  *Maybe* you were able to destroy the terrain.  I cannot remember any kind of narrative or story.  I think it was a relatively unknown game, not a big hit. It was not Comanche, nor Earth Siege 2.
2023-07-22T18:49:39Z	(#vintlya) It might have been “CyberRacer”:  https://tilde.zone/@movq/110758252780165524  (TIL: Mastodon has full threading, not just “reply to first post in thread and the rest is linear”. But UI/UX of that is super awkward … Why are modern web apps so, so bad at this?)
2023-07-22T18:53:55Z	(#autns7q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Ohweh. 😂  Haben die in den 90ern keine Identifikationsskills beim Sichten der ganzen Bigfoot-Videos aufgebaut? 😅
2023-07-27T18:35:13Z	(#h6nwjja) @<jmjl https://tilde.green/~jmjl/twtxt/twtxt.txt> Hmm, this should already work. 🤔  I’m following a bunch of people on Gemini. Are you running into any trouble? (I probably won’t be able to reply until Saturday.)
2023-07-27T18:44:04Z	(#h6nwjja) @<jmjl https://tilde.green/~jmjl/twtxt/twtxt.txt> Before working on a patch, please explain a little more what you’re planning to do. :)  jenny has a very narrow scope and I can’t guarantee that I’ll apply the patch (for example if it’s not useful to me personally).
2023-07-29T06:08:11Z	(#6ocmxea) @<jmjl https://tilde.green/~jmjl/twtxt/twtxt.txt> Hmm, how would that work in practice? Would jenny subscribe to the individual feeds of all those users (i.e., parse https://twtxt.tilde.institute/api/plain/users)? Or would it process the `/tweets` endpoint (https://twtxt.tilde.institute/api/plain/tweets)?
2023-07-29T06:09:27Z	(#6ocmxea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yes, I agree – so some extent. 😅 Registries (_or twtxt.net, for that matter_) serve the purpose of being a tool for discovering feeds.
2023-07-29T15:17:18Z	(#ecusyya) @<jmjl https://tilde.green/~jmjl/twtxt/twtxt.txt> Hmmmmmmm, I’m not sure. 🤔  Other than what @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> said, I think this could be one of those features that open the gates for spam. You don’t really have control anymore over which people you follow, so anyone could come along, push twts to that registry and thus spam your timeline. (Hence jenny would also need a *mute* feature.)  twtxt is very *pull*-based at the moment. In my eyes, this is a core feature. Making it *push*-based changes the game a lot. 🤔  I get the appeal, though. Discovering new people doesn’t work that well *inside of twtxt*. You need external tools for that.

2023-07-30T09:20:32Z	(#u6lclaa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yep. Lots of rain here as well. (Or let’s rather say, “more rain than the weeks before” …) I’m glad about it, since I don’t have any summer camps to attend. 😅 ☔
2023-07-30T14:24:02Z	(#a7rz2ja) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Lol, don’t get me started on old scanners. 🤣  Our first scanner was a “hand scanner”: You had to manually move it across the page. Absolutely horrible. 🤣  It looked like this:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner#/media/File:GeniScan_GS-4500_With_Interface_Board.jpg  Luckily, flatbed scanners came soon after …
2023-07-30T14:53:04Z	(#a7rz2ja) (Technically, my current scanner is old, too. It’s from 2006. But as long as it’s working, I’ll keep it. 🤷)

2023-07-30T16:57:24Z	After [dosfetch](https://github.com/leahneukirchen/dosfetch) popped up in my timeline, I spent the better part of the day playing with Turbo C++ and inline assembly on DOS. For some reason, I never did this back in the day. Only QuickBASIC.  That was a really nice change of pace, compared to all the modern stuff like Rust, web apps, or even just X11 programming.  Mandatory photo of dosfetch on my box:  ![](https://movq.de/v/7bb384736c/dosfetch.jpg)

2023-07-31T13:16:33Z	(#shyrzuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Awww, that’s too bad. 😢  I lost a lot of my old stuff as well.
2023-07-31T13:20:57Z	(#shyrzuq) Meanwhile, I took [asciibrot](https://uninformativ.de/git/asciibrot), replaced some POSIX stuff (like `usleep()`) with the DOS equivalent and, boom, most of it actually works:  https://movq.de/v/2fe7fa6cf2/MVI_6175.MOV.mp4 (video of animated Julia sets)  I mean, it’s not *that* surprising since it’s just a simple terminal program, but I’ve never done something like that before, so I’m pretty thrilled. 😅
2023-07-31T13:43:43Z	(#ivhcphq) @<mckinley https://mckinley.cc/twtxt.txt> Now that’s a crazy story. 😳😂  Can’t say I’ve seen something similar here in Germany. Then again, WiFi in hotels or elsewhere has always been so ridiculously expensive that I maybe used such a service once in my life, and that’s it. Didn’t even bother trying, so no idea which SSIDs were out there …

2023-08-03T19:50:10Z	Once I found out that you can follow hashtags (and not only people), Mastodon got a lot more interesting. 🤔 My timeline is flooded with interesting content now.  (Only problem is, I don’t know where I can find a list of hashtags that I’m following.

What a frustrating endeavour. 🤣 It takes so much patience and, as soon as I *wasn’t* taking a shot, there was a huge flash again. 🤣  This one is obviously the best shot:  [![](https://movq.de/v/5c39c007cf/.html-index-thumb-IMG_6401.JPG.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/5c39c007cf/IMG_6401.JPG)  The rest are honorable mentions: https://movq.de/v/5c39c007cf/  I also tried making videos, but they all turned out to be garbage.

2023-08-18T09:06:15Z	(#xnmhlba) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Well, thanks. 😅 In special situations like these it pays off to have control over what the camera does. Auto-focus, for example, would have killed everything. (And then I botched the manual focus in some shots, haha. 😅)  I saw a couple of these UFOs. 😅 Planes were crazy/desperate enough to approach the airport. They were flying right into the heart of the thunderstorm. Next day, I read reports that passengers couldn’t leave their plane, because everything was flooded at the airport. 🤷
2023-08-18T09:08:57Z	I made the mistake of not going to see an ophthalmologist for many years. Now my old doctor has nuked me from their database – and they don’t take new patients.  In fact, none of the ophthalmologists I called so far take new patients. 🙄  Might take a while until I find one … 😩  (Dude, “ophthalmologist”, what a word. In Germany, we call them “eye doctors”. 😂)

2023-08-18T14:25:39Z	(#hshhn3q) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> I wondered how you ended up with “Augenheilkunde”, but apparently the german wikipedia redirects from “Augenarzt” (that’s the person, an ophthalmologist) to “Augenheilkunde” (that’s how you call the field, ophthalmology). 😅  Finding a specialist doctor in germany can be difficult. Not just eye doctors, but all of them. And when I *do* find a new doctor, I expect to have to wait for several months until I get an appointment. According to [this statistic](https://www.gesundheitsmarkt.de/anzahl-und-statistik-praxen-augenaerzte-deutschland/), there are only about 8.4 ophthalmologists for every 100'000 people in this country (in 2020). What the heck, isn’t that a bit low? 😂  You still get help in cases of emergency (afaik, they are even required by law to help you *if* it’s an emergency). Luckily, that’s not the case for me. Technically, I can wait. Still annoying. 😅

2023-08-23T18:32:22Z	(#cyzvepa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Oh, I was just as surprised as you. 😀  A large amount of stuff just works, even signal handling – which I never expected to be available on DOS, because, you know, it’s *UNIX signals*. Turbo C++ has lots of references to UNIX anyway, the help pages almost read like manpages:  ![](https://movq.de/v/ba795f15ef/s.png)  A portability table for a function, what the heck? I never expected to see something like that. 🤯  (Turbo C++ is from 1992 – I didn’t even know what UNIX was during that time. Only DOS, Windows, and OS/2 existed in my little world.)  And it’s so fascinating that code which I wrote in 2015 without any intention of ever porting it to some other system just compiles with a 20/30 year old compiler and then the program *works*. 🤯🤯🤯  Granted, the program is simple, but still.  It shows that I don’t really have a lot of knowledge about DOS on this level / from this perspective. On the other hand, it means that I now get to explore this old operating system like it’s brand new. 😅
2023-08-25T20:10:55Z	Making a [Pipe Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Mania) “clone” of some sort could be a fun endeavour. 🤔  Might even work in a terminal using box drawing characters. Hmmmm.

That would be pretty close to the original game. On the other hand, if I were to use nothing but box drawing characters and made every cell on the terminal a tile, I could get a huge grid.

2023-08-31T19:33:58Z	X11’s `WM_NORMAL_HINTS` property is a property that can be set on a window. Part of that property is `width_inc` and `height_inc`. They tell the window manager to only increase/decrease a window’s size by certain steps.  Terminal emulators like to set these values to the font size, so that when you resize the window the size “snaps” to the next increment and the terminal widget fits *exactly* into the window. It’s a bit hard to explain for me, so here’s a demonstration:  https://movq.de/v/7909ebc08a/st.mp4  That’s the st terminal.  It appears, Wayland does not have something like `WM_NORMAL_HINTS`, so this functionality has been removed from GTK 3. (You can still set this property on your window, but it’s convoluted and not part of the GTK toolkit, i.e. you have to use Xlib yourself. That makes everything very awkward.)  Hence in xiate, it looks like this:  https://movq.de/v/7909ebc08a/xiate.mp4  I kind of got used to that over time, but now that I use st every now and then, I realize how ugly and annoying xiate’s behaviour is. 🫤
2023-08-31T19:36:19Z	(#jnfajzq) Forgot to link the docs, here it is:  https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.html#Setting_and_Reading_the_WM_NORMAL_HINTS_Property  (Nope, that’s not Twitter.)
2023-09-02T09:59:55Z	(#jnfajzq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Mhh, yeah, it looks a bit weird with a tiling WM. My WM doesn’t respect those hints in tiled layouts, either.

2023-09-03T09:06:33Z	I’m a bit confused here. One of Wayland’s advantages is to isolate clients better. For example, on X11, any client can read the screen and, thus, possibly sensitive data. That really isn’t too great.  But one valid use case of this X11 “feature” is to make screenshots.  To make screenshots work on Wayland, this protocol exists:  https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1  What I would have expected is that, when I run a screenshot tool (e.g., `grim`), the compositor asks me: “Hey, that program wants to make a screenshot, is that OK?” (That might be a bit annoying, but it’s the only way I can think of to avoid programs silently taking screenshots in the background.)  What happens instead is that `grim` just makes a screenshot, just like on X11.  I searched the bug trackers of some compositors (labwc, sway, hyperland), but couldn’t find any discussions about this.  Aren’t we almost back to square one now … ? The only advantage is that compositors now *could* ask, because there’s a well-defined protocol. But in practice they don’t. Hm.  cc @<mckinley https://mckinley.cc/twtxt.txt> since you seem to have some more experience with Wayland.
2023-09-03T16:04:34Z	(#spekvyq) Ah … GNOME does have a dialog for that:  ![](https://movq.de/v/180cfba7bc/gnome.jpg)  That’s what I would have expected.  (The text in the dialog is a lie, though. I cannot find the corresponding setting to allow/deny making screenshots. 🤷 Whatever.)

That has been a major deal-breaker for me.  I still won’t be able to reimplement [multipass](https://uninformativ.de/git/multipass) on Wayland, though. 😞  Meh. It’s an important tool in my workflows and I’d hate to give up on it.

2023-09-10T14:39:44Z	(#l47c4pa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Sysadmin stuff, yeah. I admit that it’s not strictly necessary to have this feature. I could do it all through config management. But sometimes it’s just easier and faster to do things interactively, like searching in logs or temporarily editing DNS zone files. And for that, multipass is great. Also, I sometimes build test setups on local VMs (I like to use QEMU like crazy 😅) and I don’t bother adding those to config management.
2023-09-10T16:44:23Z	(#qsinbiq) After having applyed that performance patch, I’ve used nothing but st. It works just as fine for me as xiate does. The only thing that it doesn’t support is colored emojis – but come, they’re not *that* important (to me).  I’m beginning to think that xiate’s days might be numbered. I don’t want to worry about GTK shenanigans anymore.

2023-09-14T15:03:33Z	Had a very surreal experience the other day.  We had another big thunderstorm. First of all, there was so much lightning again. 😳 Is this the new normal now?  I watched the show for a while. At some point, I saw red and green lights in the sky. Ah, an airplane, I thought. Then I noticed that it’s moving *downwards*. Is that thing crashing? Omg, it’s coming down! The thunderstorm was still going strong, so who knows, maybe this really was an accident. It went down faster and faster – and theeeen I noticed, wait, this is coming down very close to me, but I don’t hear anything.  It must have been a little drone. 🥴  Still, very confusing, the whole thing. 😅 And who in their right mind is standing on an open field in the middle of a thundersturm flying a drone? 😅

Not that clear from the article 🤔  As I understand it: The attacker was able to compromise the Google account of that employee. That would have been pretty been in and of itself. Due to this horseshit “sync” feature, though, the attacker was also able grab all those TOTP seeds that can be used to log in to other sites.  What’s unclear to me is how the attacker got to the *first* factor (probably a normal password). That was probably fished separately? And/Or that employee used the same password everywhere? 🤔

2023-10-18T17:27:34Z	(#mojeqxq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It started out good, but then it plummeted into praising GitHub. 🤔 I don’t really see the advantage of GitHub over something like Jira. Yes, Jira is much more complex, but GitHub is getting more complex all the time as well. GitHub used to be *way* simpler than it is now. It’s only a matter of time until it becomes indistinguishable from Jira. Plus, you also have a “vendor lock-in” when you use all those project management features of GitHub, don’t you? Those aren’t stored in a Git repo and they can’t be trivially migrated to some other tool. (And finally, if you already have “the discipline to do less”, you can do that with Jira just as well. Except that it’s way more expensive. 😅)  I think it all hinges on the *intent* to do things in a simple/minimalistic way. Once you’ve reached that mindset, most other things will fall into place. You’ll automatically choose plain text, for example.  (I wanted to write a blog post about this topic a few days ago but eventually gave up on it, because who am I to tell people how to write/manage software? 😂 It’s interesting nonetheless. Maybe I’ll pick it up some other day.)

2023-10-27T18:51:25Z	(#7bhzgaq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Depends, sometimes it’s within specs (you can expect something like 3 to 15m accuracy 68% of the time, IIUC), sometimes it’s 200m off (like in my test this morning) and doesn’t get better even if you wait and don’t move. But I admit that was an extreme case that I’ve only seen a couple of times.  Obviously I won’t share my real GPS tracks here. 😅  So I made a couple sketches. On a good day, it would look something like this:  https://movq.de/v/f95a556bed/sketch0.png  Green being a GPS track made with a good tracker. It’s already wobbly, even if you’re walking in straight lines, but it mostly matches your actual path. Red is the bad phone. Maybe I could have lived with this if it had been a cheap phone (which it wasn’t). In fact, my previous phone was *way* cheaper but had much better results, comparable to the green line, so this was quite a bit unexpected and disappointing.  On a bad day, it would look more like this:  https://movq.de/v/f95a556bed/sketch1.png  Basically useless.  And most of the time, it would take several minutes to get a “fix” in the first place. Meaning I was standing in front of my house for 5-10 minutes, waiting. The better phones get a fix within 5-30 seconds.  (I suspect that somehow [A-GNSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_GNSS) was broken or partially broken on the bad phone, but no idea, really. The GPS hardware is a blackbox.)

2023-10-28T13:08:31Z	(#btsebda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Mapping postal addresses to GPS coordinates? 🤔  Where would you get the data for that? Isn’t that a major undertaking? 🤔

2023-10-28T16:01:45Z	(#ttg3rma) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Pretty good. 👌  I had an unresistable urge to test that new GPS receiver, so I walked a little over 10 km. 🤣  (Slowly getting up to @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>’s levels, eh? 😅)  Now I’m gonna see what Netflix has to offer. 🎬
2023-10-29T04:04:57Z	(#btsebda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Wow, I didn’t know that existed. 😳  Unsurprisingly, there’s hardly any data available for Germany. 😅
2023-10-29T04:06:27Z	(#xhjue2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Congratz! 🏆
2023-10-29T04:10:09Z	(#ttg3rma) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Was the pizza a success? I have to admit, I’ve never had any good home-made pizza. 😂  (Assuming you did everything from scratch, not just frozen pizza.)
2023-10-29T05:34:02Z	(#btsebda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I guess german people hate collecting data, especially “personal” data, and “surveillance” in general. My immediate response was: “Hell no, I don’t want someone to know my geo location from my address!” Then I realized that anyone can type my address into Google Maps or their car’s navigation system. 🤣  It’s probably similar to Google Streetview. There was a massive outcry when Google announced Streetview back in the day. Nobody wanted to have photos taken of their homes and there were all kinds of concerns (“burglaries everywhere!”). Even today, there are large gaps in Germany compared to the rest of Europe:  https://movq.de/v/0bbd33c09a/2023-10-29--coverage-of-google-streetview-in-germany.jpg
2023-10-29T07:12:34Z	Could be an interesting project to build a custom GPS receiver based on an Arduino. No privacy concerns there.
2023-10-29T12:50:02Z	Another really good explanation of GPS (with interactive examples!): https://ciechanow.ski/gps/
2023-10-30T19:04:35Z	(#sd4uygq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Ah, as I “learned” (more or less, I haven’t grasped it all yet) from the course I linked a few days ago, this appears to be a normal thing to do for GPS receivers. If they don’t assume some position, then they can’t solve a non-linear set of equations. (Something along these lines. I should probably get [The Book](https://www.gpstextbook.com/) on GPS. 🤔)  I would assume that more sophisticated receivers just do a better job at hiding this from the users these days. 🤔
2023-10-31T12:16:22Z	(#sd4uygq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yup, the only alternative is currently “Assisted GPS” and that requires an internet connection. (That gives you almost instant access to satellite data; instead of having to download it from the satellites directly at their super slow 50 bits per second.)
2023-10-31T14:25:03Z	(#sd4uygq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Thinking about it, I have no idea how the GPS in my car can get a fix so quickly. 🤔  It doesn’t have an internet connection, at least not that I know of. It *should* take several minutes for it to get a fix. The only thing I can think of is that it regularly downloads the satellite positions from the satellites – in the background, even when the car is just parked here and is “turned off”. 🤔
2023-10-31T18:03:12Z	Stats since I started doing GPS tracking of my walks in November 2022:      Per year:     2022    46.96 km  in  18 tracks     2023   136.60 km  in  37 tracks      Per month:     2022-11   21.51 km  in 10 tracks     2022-12   25.45 km  in  8 tracks     2023-01    3.79 km  in  1 tracks     2023-02    8.93 km  in  3 tracks     2023-03    7.88 km  in  3 tracks     2023-05    9.50 km  in  2 tracks     2023-07    9.03 km  in  3 tracks     2023-08    6.93 km  in  2 tracks     2023-09   10.03 km  in  3 tracks     2023-10   80.51 km  in 20 tracks      Total:   183.56 km  in 55 tracks  Well, October 2023 was the best month so far. 🤣  I hope I can stay at that level. I was pretty lazy the rest of the year.

2023-11-04T05:21:56Z	(#5mikurq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I made a WebKit “browser” long ago, but it was just too incompatible with websites that I eventually gave up on it this year. Maybe this works better on macOS, I don’t know. On Linux, with WebKitGTK, far too many websites don’t work at all or are utterly slow or what not. It’s absolutely frustrating.  There already are a couple of WebKitGTK browsers, for example:  -   https://luakit.github.io/ -   https://surf.suckless.org/

2023-11-10T15:52:49Z	(#dacbcwq) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> So, if this clock now shows 16:20 (my wallclock says 16:52), this means that it *would be* 16:20 at my place if the sun had risen at 7:00 this morning? 🤔
2023-11-10T16:12:50Z	Nice, now that @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> mentioned it: I wasn’t aware that browsers offer a geolocation nowadays. (I hardly do any JS in the browser.) I added that to my [24h clock](https://dump.uninformativ.de/hashed/b5280c1/?geolocation=yes). 😊 ([Background story](https://www.uninformativ.de/blog/postings/2016-04-03/0/POSTING-en.html).)  I have a miniature version of that clock in my status bar. I love it. Thinking about it: Building a real Arduino-based 24h clock, that I can put on my desk, might be yet another fun project. 🤔  (I probably had that idea many times already and never got to actually doing it.)
2023-11-10T16:16:55Z	(#bwkefxa) @<eldersnake https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> That sounds like a weak argument, to be honest. 🤔  As Louis says towards the end, we might just get *yet another* consent screen. And if you don’t consent, you don’t get to watch YouTube. 🤷  I mean, this is what YouTube looks like when you open it for the first time:  [Screenshot](https://movq.de/v/cc8071f27d/s.png)  That’s already pretty close. All they have to do is remove the “Reject All” button, so there’s no way anymore to watch YouTube without accepting their TOS. 🤷  Since they’re already trying to kick out adblock users, I guess this is what we’ll end up with.

And there’s a lot of guesswork needed from Firefox – that’s why I probably won’t enable this option. It needs to guess which elements to hide and, if set to the more aggressive option, which elements to *click* (to discard the dialog). That sounds very wonky. 🫤
2023-11-23T18:43:32Z	(#zgudl2q) @<johanbove https://johanbove.info/twtxt.txt> I had no idea where it came from. 😅  There are so many “black `$something`” throughout the year and similar sales events … It was news to me that it’s related to Thanksgiving.
2023-11-23T18:50:04Z	(#a35ceca) @<johanbove https://johanbove.info/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I think that’s the case with my Epson as well. 🫤  (But mine is about 18 years old, so I’m happy that it still works at all.)
2023-11-23T18:51:17Z	(#p5zosmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Same! Time to go to bed. :-)
2023-11-24T17:02:08Z	(#7bxj6sq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> @<johanbove https://johanbove.info/twtxt.txt> Speaking of “ss” and “ß”: I regret that we don’t use the “ſ” anymore. 😅  It’s nice if you can tell “Wachstube” and “Wachſtube” apart! 😅
2023-11-25T07:55:05Z	Crap! I just realized I never made a backup of my Windows 95 CD. And now I can’t find that CD anymore. My collection is incomplete! 😱
2023-11-25T10:22:13Z	An excerpt from an interview with Raymond Chen:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UCohRKY2ns  The full interview is supposed to get released today. Looking forward to it. 😊
2023-11-25T10:28:49Z	(#ghenmeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What I “love” about this is that the popup randomly disappears after just 1 or 2 seconds – and then reappears a litle while later. 🫤
2023-11-25T11:04:58Z	(#ghenmeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don’t have a clue if they work or not. 😅  There are probably studies, but I’m too lazy to search now. 🤣  I, myself, don’t remember even having clicked on one of those banners and then proceeded to actually buy something. But what certainly *does* work on me is the effect of hearing/seeing a certain brand over and over again. “Oh, that’s a Logitech mouse, I know that manufacturer.” Stuff like that.
2023-11-25T16:57:35Z	(#qzuylfq) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> There it is! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDicLHBvQQM 🥳
2023-11-25T17:00:48Z	(#hdcu37a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  > I'm willing to get that Google™ is losing ad revenue from sponsored advertising and sponsors of Youtubers.  That sounds like a plausible explanation to me. (Then again, I have little insight into how “making money on YouTube” works. 😅)  Like @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>, I skip these sections immediately, unless it’s just one or two sentences. If it’s too long, I might just close the tab right away. 🤷
2023-11-25T20:33:21Z	(#bi76pbq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Whoa. 😲
2023-11-26T08:21:53Z	(#ngkm4ya) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Nice. 😊  One can hope for a white christmas. 😅
2023-11-26T08:28:22Z	(#crmwyna) That last story he tells there (about the masked interrupts), that’s what fascinates me about computing. 😍  You’re close to the machine and you’re dealing with interesting problems. I find this way more intriguing than all the “modern” hyped stuff like “““AI”””.
2023-11-27T18:30:19Z	(#atm7oga) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> That bee story was so mean! 😂
2023-11-27T18:32:26Z	(#ngkm4ya) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> We finally had snow today as well. 😊  I went out for a quick walk immediately, because who knows how long it’ll last. ⛄
2023-11-28T19:37:40Z	I posted [this link about Windows 3’s architecture and VMs](https://xtof.info/inside-windows3.html) a while ago, but this topic continues to fascinate me. Raymond Chen [brought it up again](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20231127-00/?p=109067) recently.  I’m aware that virtualization itself is much older than Windows 3 (IBM did it in the 1960ies, I believe?), but knowing that similar concepts existed in my tiny little machine that ran Windows 3.1 is just mindblowing. 🤯  (Alright, it wasn’t exactly “tiny”. It was an IBM PS/2 Model 80. 🤣)
2023-11-28T19:38:35Z	(#ngkm4ya) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> No need for snowplows here. All the snow is already gone. 😢
2023-11-29T15:55:30Z	(#hz2qwyq) Made it to 100km today. 🥳  (It was harder than it should have been, because I was basically knocked out for about a week. 🤣)
2023-11-30T11:48:39Z	(#hz2qwyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I walked. 😅  I mean, I walk rather fast and it’s not a relaxed stroll, but it certainly isn’t running. 😅  The goal isn’t to lose weight but to be outdoors, enjoy nature, and clear my mind.  Just to be clear, it was 100km over the course of a whole month. It was 23 tracks with 4.4km per track on average (4.4km is roughly 50 minutes). It’s actually not *that much*, it’s mostly time consuming. 😂
2023-11-30T16:53:31Z	(#fbgdevq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Oh lovely, look at all that snow. 😍  Good luck to the restaurant guys.
2023-12-01T15:13:25Z	(#spbxjha) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> Whaaaaaaaat, you’re doing a programming challenge at this time of the year and it ISN’T Advent of Code?! 😱 😅
2023-12-01T19:43:25Z	(#7hvbypa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Now that’s what I’d call winter. 😊  Awesome to look at. Poor camera, though. 😮
2023-12-01T19:47:51Z	(#hzu4kfq) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> Great timing. 😅  Yeah, it can be quite exhausting to do one puzzle per day. I guess taking some vacation is mandatory. 😂
2023-12-02T03:57:34Z	(#mldneoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Argh! 🤢  I wish you guys a speedy recovery.  (Any idea where you got it?)
2023-12-02T04:01:45Z	(#kr3qhra) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I joined as `movq42rax`. Don’t expect speedy results from me, because porting my solutions to DOS is my personal goal this year, intended to be runnable on that old Pentium. 😅  ![](https://movq.de/v/2803679624/s.png)
2023-12-02T04:07:38Z	(#mxyoxrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It’s the perfect time of day for Aussies, isn’t it? People in the EU would have to get up around 6am. 🤣  I just happened to be awake anyway today.
2023-12-02T04:41:37Z	(#mldneoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ah, right, kids and school. Yeah, oof, nothing you can do about that. 😐
2023-12-02T04:48:42Z	(#kr3qhra) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The solutions will go here:      git clone https://uninformativ.de/git/advent-of-code.git  About demos … I made a video yesterday, but I’m not sure if it’s that interesting. 😅  https://movq.de/v/de32f1481f/MVI_6756.MOV.mp4  I’d probably have to do some cool visualizations for the more interesting puzzles. 🤔  Not sure if I can pull that off, though. 😅  It’s probably going to be hard enough anyway. (I wonder how long I can get away with just conventional memory, i.e. only ~500 kB.) We’ll see.
2023-12-02T05:53:42Z	(#kr3qhra) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It sure does! 😊  (Was the video big/large enough? I should probably capture in a higher resolution next time. 🤔)
2023-12-02T05:55:46Z	(#mxyoxrq) My immediate reaction to today’s puzzle was: “Ahhh, shit.” 😂  Parsing these input files in C is not a lot of fun. 🥴
2023-12-02T07:39:28Z	(#wg7xx5q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That is a lot of code, yes. 😅  Mine is shorter, has more naive searching (it searches a word like `red` and then backtracks to the number before it; completely ignoring the semi-colons because they don’t matter), and – like any good C program – will crash horribly on malformed input. 👌😂🥴  https://www.uninformativ.de/git/advent-of-code/file/2023/day02/s.c.html  It really depends on what you’re after. I’d never write code like this in “real-world applications”. But for these puzzles and my DOS use case, it’s “good enough”. 😅
2023-12-02T09:57:28Z	Here’s some more #AdventOfCode nostalgia:  https://movq.de/v/6441f2fe2a/MVI_6760.MOV.mp4  It shows the machine’s boot sequence and the copy process: I somehow have to grab the files from my normal PC and I do that using FTP under Windows 3.11, there’s a PCI Ethernet card in that machine. Then some glorious WinZip action to decompress the files. 😃  Finally the first two AoC 2023 puzzles are being run.  (Yes, there’s a GRUB on that machine. 🥴  It’s a left-over from some experiments with Linux ages ago and I didn’t bother to uninstall it.)
2023-12-03T04:45:26Z	(#6oq4ywq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Ah, you went with the “scanning” approach as well. I did that, too.  It’s quite surprising to see (imho) how many people on reddit started substituting strings (`one` becomes `1` etc.). That makes the puzzle *much* harder by introducing nasty corner cases.  (Maybe I was just lucky this time to pick the correct approach right from the start. 🤣  Or maybe it’s a bit of experience from doing past AoC events …)
2023-12-03T04:47:09Z	(#vdtfw2a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> All I can say is: My client didn’t report any errors. :-)  (Does that mean anything? 😅)
2023-12-03T06:00:21Z	(#qwm7hha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Oof, it’s already getting a bit tricky. 😬
2023-12-03T08:12:17Z	(#apnoyca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  > Did I write too much code again? 😅  I don’t know. 😅  My solution is rather long as well:  https://www.uninformativ.de/git/advent-of-code/file/2023/day03/s.c.html  Still happily runs on DOS.
2023-12-03T08:39:43Z	(#apnoyca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yours is more clever and cleaner, I think. 🤔  You were able to reuse more code for the second part. I, instead, wrote a different search logic for part 2. 😅
2023-12-03T16:30:26Z	(#qwm7hha) A little “visualization” / “progress bar” of day 3 part 2:  https://movq.de/v/6fc13f8ce1/MVI_6766.MOV.mp4  Running in a DOS box under OS/2 Warp 4, including some of OS/2’s silly sound effects. 🤣
2023-12-04T13:15:47Z	(#zkjovca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (Mild spoilers ahead.)  Today’s puzzle was one of those where I immediately knew that there *must* be a solution that does not require actually copying anything. AoC often has these kinds of problems that make it *look like* you have to create lots of duplicates, multiply objects, stuff like that. That’s often a sign that you can solve it by doing something simple. 😅   (If only that was true in real life as well. 😂)
2023-12-04T14:28:09Z	A couple centimeters of snow today. 😊  And I’ve got a loooooooong vacation coming up. Time to relax. 😃  [![](https://movq.de/v/deb1b7c7e6/.html-index-thumb-1.jpg.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/deb1b7c7e6/1.jpg)  [![](https://movq.de/v/deb1b7c7e6/.html-index-thumb-2.jpg.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/deb1b7c7e6/2.jpg)  This is my favorite time of the year – by far. Even if it means the snow will freeze in my beard. 😂
2023-12-04T14:30:31Z	(#zkjovca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I can try to explain, if you want to know. 😅 Or maybe this guy’s visualization will help (if you can see it, not sure): https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18af47j/2023_day_4_scratchcard_counting/
2023-12-04T14:31:05Z	(#ghidsjq) @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt> If you can describe the problem, maybe I can help.

2023-12-04T16:22:12Z	It is a pleasure to work with the help system of Borland’s Turbo C++ 3.0 on DOS. The descriptions are clear and concise. There are short and simple examples. Pretty much every help page is cross-refenced and those links can be *clicked*.
2023-12-04T20:38:08Z	(#ghidsjq) @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt> Sure thing. The address is on my website. 👌
2023-12-05T04:48:29Z	(#ghidsjq) @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt> I got it. I was already asleep yesterday. 😅
2023-12-05T04:49:41Z	(#txfbuaq) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> It’s been a while since I used QBasic/QuickBasic, but yep, I remember the experience being quite similar. 😊
2023-12-05T06:42:03Z	(#irslaoq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> I ask myself that question every year. 🤣  To be fair, the first part wasn’t really that difficult. If you have *A LOT* of experience with these kind of problems/puzzles and if you have a proper framework, I imagine it’s doable. (I, on the other hand, spent about 40 minutes just writing my C code to parse the input.)  Some of these people record themselves and then post it on YouTube. It’s pretty crazy to watch. 🥴  The second part of the puzzle, was/is pretty hard, though. At least for me, because I haven’t found “the trick” yet. I’m currently trying to brute-force it while having breakfast. 😅  (But given that it took ~8 minutes for the first person to get both stars, maybe they brute-forced it as well. With a faster machine and multithreading, ~8 minutes sounds about right. Brute-force is rarely the answer in AoC, though.)
2023-12-05T06:43:50Z	(#irslaoq) … it just finished and brute-force worked. 18 minutes of computing time on my 11 year old machine, single-threaded.
2023-12-05T14:06:37Z	(#irslaoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Doing AoC competitively is super hard. I don’t enjoy this at all. I just *happened* to be quick these first few days. 😅  I rather set my own goals. Like the DOS thing this year. That is a lot of fun. 😊  (I just have to remember not to check the leaderboards. 🤣)
2023-12-06T04:15:20Z	(#zktowyq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> And that is still a brute-force attempt? That’d be *really* fast. 😳  Are you doing anything clever or is your CPU just that powerful? 😅
2023-12-06T04:17:51Z	(#ebrldga) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> What a great scenery. 😊  I hope the snow comes back soon. It’s all gone at the moment and well above 0°C.
2023-12-06T05:26:40Z	(#zktowyq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> I see, interesting. 🤔  Now I’m curious if I could optimize my brute-force solution as well. 😅  (I wrote a “proper” solution in the meantime after watching a visualization by someone else.)
2023-12-06T05:32:01Z	Today’s AoC puzzle is a very simple problem on modern machines, but quite tricky for me: It involves a number that doesn’t fit into 32 bits. 🤔  I wonder if/how I can manage to port this beast to DOS.  (I once wrote a “big int” library myself, but that was *ages* ago and I hardly remember it anymore.)
2023-12-06T14:20:06Z	(#y7edboa) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Yes, exactly that. *But*: I do have more than 32 bits after all, when I use `double` or `long double`. 😲  I went with `long double` which has 80 bits even on DOS (63 bits mantissa, I think).  (I only wrote a brute-force thingy this morning, so I didn’t even think about doing anything related to polynomials or `double`. 😅  Even part 2 only took 55 ms. But for DOS, this wasn’t an option anyway, so I did the proper math while waiting for something at work. 🤣)  ![](https://movq.de/v/a8d2d3d8bd/os2.jpg)  It’s still a bit surprising to me. Usually, AoC doesn’t require such tricks and most things fit neatly into 32 bits. Maybe there’s a better solution after all. 🤔  I might have a look at reddit.
2023-12-06T17:30:16Z	(#zkjd2ya) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Nice! 😊  I like it when those puzzles are solvable using pen and paper. Some of the other puzzles require you to write lots and lots of code, that can be really tedious.  (Yes, I know that it’s called “Advent of *Code*”. 😂)
2023-12-07T04:57:07Z	(#mniqw3q) @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt> Do you have mutt’s threading view turned on?  ``` set sort = threads set sort_aux = date-sent set strict_threads = yes ```  I find this to be very non-confusing. 🤔
2023-12-07T17:48:37Z	(#np2awqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I still haven’t seen this and I sure hope it stays that way. 🤔
2023-12-07T17:49:21Z	(#7jmjuwa) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> If only I could see them. All I get is Twitter’s login screen. 🫤
2023-12-07T18:40:31Z	(#np2awqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> uBlock Origin on Firefox, yes. I also wipe my browser profile on every shutdown – not sure if that makes a difference.
2023-12-08T06:35:50Z	Another great #AdventOfCode puzzle today: Not that hard on modern CPUs but a challenge for DOS. That’s the interesting stuff I was hoping for!
2023-12-08T16:30:53Z	One thing to note about #AdventOfCode: It is really, really important to inspect your input data.  Your data could be considered part of the puzzle description. By inspecting it, you can find clues and you might find out that you can make certain assumptions.  (I mean, what’s the alternative? There could be a list of allowed assumptions in the textual descriptions, right? That wouldn’t be a lot of fun, I think, as it would give away too much information about the solution. It’s more interesting to find those clues yourself.)
2023-12-08T19:30:04Z	(#iodpkda) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I hate that. Worse, these items show up in the RSS feeds as well. I don’t get the point of this at all. 🤷

2023-12-10T11:12:41Z	(Advent of Code SPOILERS AHEAD.)  The pipe maze puzzle was another good opportunity to do a little visualization.  My way of drawing bitmaps isn’t good, though. It’s just a series of `putpixel()` calls. There has got to be a better way (not sure if BGI allows for something faster). 🤔  https://movq.de/v/de55891ae3/MVI_6775.MOV.mp4

2023-12-10T19:32:36Z	Took a while until I got the hang of it, but I finally managed to work with `huge` pointers on DOS. I can now allocate a “single” block of data to hold an entire 640x480 image with 16 colors and then display it:  ![](https://movq.de/v/7312e2a7eb/IMG_6778.JPG-small.jpg)  Segmentation is horrible. I’m glad we no longer do this.
2023-12-11T06:17:55Z	I see @<taigrr https://ndl.taigrr.com/user/taigrr/twtxt.txt> on our Yarn/twtxt Advent of Code leaderboard. But I can’t load this person’s twtxt feed. Hmm. 🤔

(Well, maybe it’s both.)
2023-12-12T04:53:15Z	(#ajn52zq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah!

2023-12-12T12:52:39Z	(#lprkata) Ha, I *did* get it to work on DOS! I only have about 3.9 kB of stack size available, which is very little for all the recursion that we’re doing today. As a last resort, converting recursion to iteration might have been an option, but I managed to keep the stack usage small enough (about 3.5 kB).  That was a tough one …
2023-12-13T16:51:41Z	Today’s Advent of Code puzzle was rather easy (luckily), so I spent the day doing two other things:  -   Explore VGA a bit: How to draw pixels on DOS all by yourself without a library in graphics mode 12h? -   Explose XMS a bit: How can I use more than 640 kB / 1 MB on DOS?  Both are … quite awkward. 😬  For VGA, I’ll stick to using the Borland Graphics Interface for now. Mode 13h is great, all pixels are directly addressable – but it’s only 320x200. Mode 12h (640 x 480 with 16 colors) is pretty horrible to use with all the planes and what not.  As per [this spec](http://qzx.com/pc-gpe/xms30.txt), I’ve written a small XMS example that uses 32 MB of memory:  https://movq.de/v/9ed329b401/xms.c  It works, but it appears the only way to make use of this memory is to copy data back and forth between conventional memory and extended memory. I don’t know how useful that is going to be. 🤔  But at least I know how it works now.  ![](https://movq.de/v/b4ca259ea9/s.png)
2023-12-14T09:03:37Z	(#lprkata) @<taigrr https://twtxt.net/user/taigrr/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I got it. 😅  After some optimization, it runs on DOS.

2023-12-15T11:00:18Z	I bet today’s AoC puzzle was the last easy one before we descend into madness. 🤣
2023-12-15T12:04:01Z	(#mldneoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Good to hear! 🙂  Wow, nobody else caught it? How did you manage to do that? 😅
2023-12-15T18:56:24Z	That was a productive day.  I dug through VGA again and finally understood some crucial parts. My AoC visualizations now use my own VGA “interface” (or “driver” or whatever you want to call it).  It is *much* faster than [BGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Graphics_Interface), but this comes at a cost: Higher memory usage. I need an additional ~150 kB now.  Let’s see if I’m going to regret this because I run out of memory. 🤣  I don’t think so, though, because this is only for the visualizations and not for the actual AoC puzzle solutions. The visualizations are just an added bonus anyway.
2023-12-15T18:57:48Z	(#42lclbq) Neat side effect: I can use my [Linux bitmap font](https://uninformativ.de/git/fiamf3) in those DOS visualizations now. 🥳

2023-12-17T05:55:33Z	Ah, there it is. Today’s AoC puzzle is of a categeory that I find the least interesting. Gonna take my time with this one. 😴
2023-12-17T09:24:40Z	(#5czdftq) I don’t enjoy this type of problem at all and looked for help. I’m here for the DOS stuff, not Y29udmluY2luZyBEaWprc3RyYSBpbnRvIGRvaW5nIHRoZSByaWdodCB0aGluZwo=.  Still, the solution takes way too much memory. Since I don’t liked the puzzle to begin with, I won’t spend time trying to optimize it. (I have some more interesting VGA stuff on my TODO list.)
2023-12-17T09:27:10Z	(#5czdftq) (That being said, I do have a C version going with my own aGFzaAo= and YXJyYXktYmFja2VkIGJpbmFyeSBtaW4taGVhcAo= implementation, so it’s not like I copied someone else’s code verbatim.)

2023-12-20T10:32:54Z	I’m really bad at competitive programming. 🙄  For today’s #AdventOfCode puzzle, I spent an eternity trying to understand exactly what kind of bG9naWMgY2lyY3VpdAo= the puzzle input describes – I haven’t done that in well over a decade, so I made little progress. I knew right from the start that SSBoYWQgdG8gbG9vayBmb3IgY3ljbGUgbGVuZ3RocyBhbmQgdGhlbiBmaW5kIHRoZSBMQ00K.

2023-12-29T19:02:14Z	(#eyibmrq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> They sure are silly at times. :-) You really have to combine this event with something else, like learning a new language. Otherwise it gets boring real quick.  What I absolutely love about AoC is that it’s – indeed – a bit like school. 😅  The problems are well-defined, the inputs are well-defined, and there is a definite answer. It’s either right or wrong – period. Compared to real life and work, I welcome this very much. 🤣
2023-12-29T19:14:17Z	It’s still very, very young and obviously not yet finished, but I made a little pool billiard game for DOS:  https://movq.de/v/71b4f0230c/MVI_6870.MOV.mp4  (Full disclosure: Back in the day, there was a very similar game called “Magic Pool”: https://movq.de/v/06a59f5876/s.png https://movq.de/v/b82807d277/s.png It had a higher resolution with more pixels, but also way more flickering. My program took quite some inspiration from the UI of this game.)  Programming on DOS is surprisingly enjoyable and rather easy to learn, assuming you know a tiny little bit about 8086 assembly – that’s necessary to read docs like this one, which describes the mouse driver API:  https://stanislavs.org/helppc/int_33.html  All this is certainly *much, much* easier than anything we have today. Try getting a pixel on the screen with modern OpenGL. 😒  On the other hand, getting high resolution timestamps is hard(er). The resolution of `_dos_gettime()` is only ~55 ms, which is unusably low. It took me quite some time to sift through this and the source code of DJGPP, now I have a short function that gives me timestamps of ~900 ns resolution:  https://www.xtof.info/Timing-on-PC-familly-under-DOS.html
2023-12-29T19:47:42Z	(#sdzpmwa) Honestly, this whole DOS thing is “what I’m here for”. I find it super interesting and I haven’t been this motivated to do computer stuff in a long time (probably since I wrote my X11 window manager).  All the topics and concepts are challenging but relatively easy to understand in the end. The same goes for old-school computer graphic topics, like raycasting (or even basic raytracing, for that matter, that’s an old technique as well). You can read up on that and dig through it in a weekend or two. That’s just great.  And it’s in stark contrast to most of the “modern” topics that we have today. Like … try using Kubernetes or Terraform. Try learning Rust. It’s all gotten so convoluted and complex, it’s not fun anymore.
2023-12-30T15:00:30Z	(#qqietra) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Ah, the thing with the elves and all that? I don’t think that’s meant to be taken seriously. This story is often over-the-top silly and bizarre. 😅  It’s just funny to me. Although, admittedly, it was a little less crazy this year. But yeah, maybe not everyone likes this kind of thing. ✌️
2023-12-30T15:03:19Z	(#sdzpmwa) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> Yeah, the 3D pool games were just crazy magical to me back then. 😅  But you’re right, nothing beats a real-life pool table. All of these games are quite awkward to play and don’t feel “real” at all. 🥴

2024-01-03T20:42:49Z	I’m currently working on a little Ray Caster for DOS using this tutorial:  https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html  It’s easy to port the example code to DOS, but that’s not the interesting part. I’m taking the time to really understand the math behind it (the tutorial is pretty vague at times) and I’m writing it down in LaTeX. Yay, finally some TeX again! 😃
2024-01-04T06:55:55Z	(#rnnu6ma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well, here’s the “short” story … 😅  You know this thing when you press a key and it appears at once, and when you keep the key pressed there’s a short delay and then the key repeats? That happens on DOS, too, and it’s unsuitable for games. What you want for a game is something like a “key event” (i.e., “key `A` has been pressed now” and “key `A` has been released now”). DOS doesn’t provide an API for that.  For very simple games, you can ask the BIOS about the state of the Shift, Alt, and Ctrl keys:  https://stanislavs.org/helppc/int_16-2.html  There are individual bits for those keys and you can all tell them apart. I’m pretty sure some games used only this method, for example `TROPFEN`:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYCDJ6W4ySc  You only need to go left or right in this game, or activate a lift. The two Shift keys and Ctrl are used for that. I always wondered why this game uses such weird keys instead of the cursor keys – now I know. 😅  For more elaborate games, you need to write your own handler for hardware IRQ 1. 😀  Then you get to see all the key presses and releases.

2024-01-06T12:03:13Z	Last week of my vacation. I made a little racing game for real-mode DOS that uses ray casting for rendering. There’s not a lot of game logic, except for lap timing and the tiles next to the walls have very high friction.  The tracks are procedurally generated. You can select one from the command line. (I love that concept very much.)  Getting the basic game done wasn’t too hard. I could reuse a lot of code from my little pool billiards game.  But … oh my goodness, the performance? The video was made on my Pentium 133, which is *very* powerful for the DOS era. And yet, it barely makes it above 25 FPS. I already used a couple of tricks (no floating point in some parts, try to keep an eye on cache locality, …) and I’ve passed on texturing the floor. The hot code paths are those that copy data in memory, like reading a pixel value for a texture and then copying it to the VGA buffer.  I’ve learned to appreciate games like Duke Nukem 3D a lot more now – how on earth can they be so fast? 🤯  I’ve got some homework to do …  https://movq.de/v/18f0d4be8d/MVI_6951.MOV.mp4
2024-01-06T12:44:56Z	(#p6gk6qa) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Almost 100% C. A tiny little bit of inline assembly, but it’s just a few instructions.  I use [Open Watcom V2](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2) to cross-compile it directly from Linux, pretty handy.
2024-01-07T08:04:07Z	(#p6gk6qa) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> Yeah, the good thing about racing games is that they’re so simple. 😅  No story needed, no complex game logic. It was perfect for this little toy project. (It’s not the actual Wolfenstein engine, though, it’s just the same method of rendering. 😅)
2024-01-07T08:05:45Z	(#jminddq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Someone on Mastodon mentioned that it might be worth using assembly instead of C. So I rewrote two hot code paths with inline assembly this morning. And, lo and behold, this got me from ~27.6 fps to ~38.5 fps. 🤯
2024-01-07T09:22:49Z	(#rdjxm5q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> It’s much more than I expected. In my experience, trying to use assembly to optimize C programs has hardly any effect these days. The C compilers have become really, really good. If anything, you’ll make it worse when you put your own assembly stuff in there. 😅  But apparently it’s a different story for Open Watcom / DOS / real mode … 🤔

Wundert mich, dass LaTeX das nicht standardmäßig anders arrangiert, um das zu vermeiden. Muss ich nochmal nachschauen, so hübsch ist’s ja nun nicht. 😀  > Die Levelgenerierung finde ich ziemlich genial.  Zu der Idee mit der Musterersetzung bin ich über Advent of Code gekommen. Also nicht direkt über die Puzzles, aber auf Reddit wird manchmal diskutiert, wie denn wohl die Puzzle-Daten bei AoC erstellt werden – da gibt es nämlich auch ganz viele solcher „Labyrinthe“. Und da hat mal einer geschrieben: „Wahrscheinlich beginnt er mit einem Kreis und deformiert den dann so lange, bis $Bedingung erreicht ist.“  Auch die Darstellung der Strecken in der Textdatei ist ganz stark an AoC-Puzzles angelehnt.  Mich fasziniert ein bisschen, dass quasi nur eine Regel („da ist eine Gerade, mach’ mal einen Knick rein“) ausreicht, um so viel Variation zu erreichen. Also, das ist schon noch verbesserungsfähig, aber es funktioniert schon deutlich besser, als ich erwartet hatte.
2024-01-08T20:10:46Z	Watched these lovely videos today:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hpE7lNLODw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adkIx0iO5dY  (There are two more.)  The guy is restoring an IBM PS/2 Model 30 (the 8086 version) – and it took a loooooooot of work. Hats off.  That machine holds a special place in my heart, because it was one of the first PCs I had (I think I had the 286 version, though). It always brings a smile to my face when I see one. 😊  I wish I still had mine. Re-buying one now is probably not a good idea, I wouldn't have the skills to do that kind of restoration. (Or I pay someone to do it, which would be super expensive …)
2024-01-08T20:25:04Z	(#g7ledpq) (Damn, I feel an urge to get hold of an old machine like that. At least some 386, but an 8086 would be better.)

2024-01-09T17:38:32Z	Been rummaging through the basement and look what I found! The very last LS-120 diskette. 🥳  https://movq.de/v/0e60054c57  This was such a cool thing back then. It had the same physical size as a normal 3½" floppy disk but it could store 120 MB. 🤯  And the drive (I had an internal one) could read both types of disks as well, which, from my perspective, was a lot better than the ZIP drive. The ZIP drive was an additional, specialized drive only for those disks.  Sadly, I have neither drive anymore. Only some disks. The LS-120 one is marked as “defective” anyway. RIP. 🪦  Both were pushed out of the market by writable CDs soon after …

2024-02-08T17:31:28Z	I noticed that some of my software projects have a rather long lifetime, so I made a little graph:  <https://www.uninformativ.de/git/timeline.png>
2024-02-08T17:34:08Z	(#nr6f4ja) Hmm, maybe I should also plot the *gaps*. 🤔  There are many projects that don’t see commits for a couple of years. Oh well, that’s task for another day.
2024-02-08T18:36:45Z	(#nr6f4ja) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Most of them, yes. That’s the code I host [on my website](https://www.uninformativ.de/git/). dwm-vain, tabbed-vain and qsqs are forks, though, hence dwm-vain appears to be much older. (I only started using dwm in 2012.)  I didn’t use version control systems in the distant past, but nobody wants to see that old stuff anyway. 😅

2024-02-09T16:34:29Z	(#nr6f4ja) Now the graph shows the gaps:  <https://www.uninformativ.de/git/timeline.png>  Much more realistic. Most stuff lies dormant most of the time. 😅  Which is a good thing in my book. I think there’s something wrong if software needs constant tinkering.

Weird. 🤨🤔  This is the kind of program I was looking for.  1.  It is free software. Especially in the DOS ecosystem, free/libre software is a very scarce resource. 2.  It’s a small command line program, not a huge behemoth. 3.  Documentation appears to be well written. 4.  It can even cross-compile DOS binaries from Linux.

There won’t be any shops and, if I understood correctly, you won’t be able to legally buy weed unless you register in a club or grow your own plants.  I think the main point of that law is to decriminalize those people who smoke (because they do it anyway and the punishments were too harsh) – and not to motivate regular people to become smokers.  We’ll see … let’s talk again in a couple of years. 😅

2024-02-28T13:47:25Z	(#zwpd7hq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> It usually depends on how easy it is to parse given the project’s circumstances. For Python, it’s usually JSON because you can easily turn this into a `dict`. For C with GTK, it’s INI because GLib comes with an INI parser. For minimalistic C, it’s just a `config.h`. You get the idea. 😃

2024-03-05T15:35:23Z	(#gwbdn3q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Wouldn’t a cronjob suffice here? Give it a list of repos to mirror, then do daily pulls. As you mentioned in the other threads, the only thing to worry about is force-pushed upstreams. 🤔  Or vandalism upstream. What if they delete all branches … Okay, now that I think about it, it might be a little more complicated. 😂
2024-03-05T16:48:05Z	(#iee7bsq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Indeed, I use the “join threads” feature of Mutt quite often. 😅  But unlike @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>, I completely gave up on TOFU at `$dayjob`. 😂  Way too much work to clean up other people’s mail all the time … I admire your mental strength. 😆

2024-03-10T07:04:56Z	(#n66yp3q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I shut it off. It became increasingly difficult to decide where to put which content. Does it go into the phlog, the weblog, just twtxt, Mastodon, something else, … ? I wanted to reduce the number of “channels” that I use. And Gopher is the hardest for people to access – not from a technical point of view, of course, but _regular_ clients basically don’t support it anymore. Aside from a small “elite” group, nobody could access it (and I’d rather not have to point people to Gopher proxies all the time).  I’d rather focus on keeping my website compatible with older/retro clients. Not having a forced redirect to HTTPS and sticking to a simple layout is mostly enough.  Netscape 4.07 on WfW 3.11:  [![](https://movq.de/v/10948b8de6/.html%2Dindex%2Dthumb%2Dns4.jpg.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/10948b8de6/ns4.jpg)  Netscape 2.02 on OS/2 Warp 4 (only 16 colors in QEMU at the moment):  [![](https://movq.de/v/10948b8de6/.html%2Dindex%2Dthumb%2Dns2.jpg.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/10948b8de6/ns2.jpg)  (Those older clients tend to extend HTTP/1.0 a bit by sending a `Host:` header. Without that, my webserver wouldn’t be able to find the correct vhost.)  Really, having my _exact same website_ accessible with those browsers feels more rewarding than having to resort to Gopher. 🤔
2024-03-10T07:50:39Z	I was today years old when I learned that you can connect to a DOS machine over a serial line. 🤯🥴  Do `ctty com2` in DOS and then something like `minicom -D /dev/nullmodem -R cp437 -b 9600` on Linux, for example.  It literally only redirects stdin/stdout/stderr on DOS, which limits what you can do quite a bit. Launching `edit`, for example, starts the editor on the normal screen and you have to use the actual keyboard to control it.  (It’s probably useful to note that you can back to normal operations using `ctty con`.)  Those 9600 baud are pretty slow and they make it feel like you’re sitting in front of an old machine where even `dir` prints line by line, slowly.  Fun stuff. 😅  [![](https://movq.de/v/56906c28cf/.html%2Dindex%2Dthumb%2Dserial1.png.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/56906c28cf/serial1.png) [![](https://movq.de/v/56906c28cf/.html%2Dindex%2Dthumb%2Dserial2.png.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/56906c28cf/serial2.png)

2024-03-13T13:53:34Z	(#zm5qtpq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I think we (as in “the free software community”) have largely given up on that. `curl foo | sh` is basically equivalent to running precompiled binaries or the huge dependency mess that we have these days (simple programs pulling in 47289 libraries). We run completely untrusted code all the time and nobody cares anymore. The idea of eliminating distributions (which at least provide *some* layer of quality control) pops up again and again. A `curl foo | sh` is probably the *least* harmful thing these days, because it’s the easiest issue to fix.  (Meh: Rust’s `curl https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` downloads a 15 MB binary that does god-knows-what.)  Or am I missing the point? 🤔
