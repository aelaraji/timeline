2023-12-11T21:37:55Z	(#fwietfq) yeah it died :(â€¨â€¨but I'm here!
2023-12-11T21:43:59Z	(#ricdxsa) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> it's a form of protest, it's saying 'we put something here but we're not allowed to tell you what it is; this is not the art in it's original form FYI' instead of silently modifying it. â€¨â€¨For music we do just mute or edit over it (songs with 'radio edit' in the title) since it's jarring for an audio-only medium but not for movies or tv. â€¨â€¨Funny part is for movies/tv we also change the captions and blur mouths, it's not just an audio thing
2023-12-11T21:44:58Z	(#fwietfq) Will hopefully bring my pod back again someday when I have more time for hobby projects

2023-12-14T07:06:58Z	(#ricdxsa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> yeah it can be either but if you listen to Dynamite by Taio Cruz for example, pay attention to the difference between radio edit and the original, it's one of the more obvious edits
