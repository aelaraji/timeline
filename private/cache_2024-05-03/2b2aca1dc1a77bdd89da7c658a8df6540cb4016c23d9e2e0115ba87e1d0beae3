2021-03-05T03:36:56Z	Hello, @<mckinley https://mckinley.cc/twtxt.txt> here. I hope it isn't confusing for me to maintain two feeds. I made this feed to more easily interact with the twt.social community, leaving the one on my website as a regular microblog.
2021-03-05T03:47:30Z	(#<kpifl7a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=kpifl7a>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you. I rarely use my phone for things other than calls or text messages, but I'll give the app a try if I need to post from my phone.
2021-03-05T03:51:42Z	(#<yzslitq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=yzslitq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thanks for clarifying. Either way, it's a very reasonable privacy policy. I was just wondering about the details. If you don't store the email addresses, is it just a hash that's stored? Check against it for recovery, send an email if it passes?
2021-03-05T04:05:42Z	(#<yzslitq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=yzslitq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I really like that. Email can't be known until it's needed.
2021-03-05T05:57:37Z	(#<gmlphva https://twtxt.net/search?tag=gmlphva>) Mkws is great the way it is, and `pp` is genius. The only reason why I don't use it for my own site is because I can't figure out how to escape the required characters in an elegant way before files are sent to `pp`. The best parts of mkws are the simplicity and the ability to tweak the script for your use case. Putting everything in one binary or adding a bunch of extra features like a web server would add unnecessary complication.
2021-03-05T06:20:02Z	(#<gmlphva https://twtxt.net/search?tag=gmlphva>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Double quotes and ampersands with a backslash for `sh`, probably other characters it uses to do special functions as well. I just can't get used to omitting quotes or using single quotes in HTML tags.
2021-03-05T06:40:41Z	(#<gmlphva https://twtxt.net/search?tag=gmlphva>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I believe so, and I can't for the life of me remember what problem I ran into.
2021-03-05T06:54:16Z	(#<gmlphva https://twtxt.net/search?tag=gmlphva>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Thank you, I appreciate it. If I remember correctly, the `printf` program can escape a string for shell input, but I had difficulty making it work elegantly with the contents of a multi-line file.
2021-03-05T21:49:17Z	(#<gmlphva https://twtxt.net/search?tag=gmlphva>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I'm trying it again with a clear head, and I'm making a little headway.
2021-03-07T08:23:02Z	(#<fw4vzga https://twtxt.net/search?tag=fw4vzga>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Void and OpenBSD are pretty hardcore, as operating systems go. I'm surprised you can tolerate Windows.
2021-03-07T08:34:33Z	(#<fw4vzga https://twtxt.net/search?tag=fw4vzga>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Ah, I see.
2021-03-08T19:47:21Z	(#<psf3g3q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=psf3g3q>) The suspense is killing me, was it successful?
2021-03-08T22:48:43Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<xxrg4za https://twtxt.net/search?tag=xxrg4za>) Yeah, I don't know what to set it to. I don't know if I should go with the synthwave bagel I usually use, or something else.

2021-03-09T18:13:49Z	(#<p52lajq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=p52lajq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> It's HN, but made to look like lobste.rs. It's not a slightly off mock-up made in GIMP, I spent much more time than I care to admit writing very messy, very hacky CSS.
2021-03-09T18:45:03Z	(#<k3qmxgq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=k3qmxgq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#<k3qmxgq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=k3qmxgq>) Very minimal progress has been made since my last twt about it. After working for hours and making glacial progress, I couldn't get titles to work, got frustrated, and left to go do something else. Haven't worked on it since that day. Now that I think of it, I couldn't take advantage of `pp` in the content of documents anyway because I'm escaping everything.
2021-03-09T18:52:58Z	(#<p52lajq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=p52lajq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> No, I like its normal styling a lot. I just did this for fun, and thought you gentlemen might enjoy it. Maybe I'll make Lobsters look like HN at some point. That would probably be a lot easier, I won't have to work in the confines of tables.
2021-03-09T19:05:45Z	(#<jatw6pq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jatw6pq>) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Great job, and I like the look of the sidebar. It makes the whole thing look delightfully retro, and doesn't cost that much space on the side. I agree that it shouldn't be fixed while scrolling, though.
2021-03-09T19:09:13Z	(#<k3qmxgq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=k3qmxgq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> If all the documents were in the root directory and I could get used to not using quotes, mkws would most certainly be my pick.
2021-03-09T19:32:13Z	(#<jatw6pq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jatw6pq>) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> If I have some time today, I can recreate your mock-ups in HTML and CSS. It always helps to scroll through it in the browser, see what it would really look like.
2021-03-09T19:37:45Z	(#<k3qmxgq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=k3qmxgq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Huh, I tried going back to stock mkws while I was working on my own script, and it wouldn't generate pages in other directories. I didn't really poke through it and figure out why. Do you have to add the new directories manually in the script?
2021-03-09T19:53:51Z	(#<k3qmxgq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=k3qmxgq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> As for `sed`ing files, that's what I'm already doing. At the moment, I just can't benefit from `pp` inside my content documents because I'm escaping everything. I agree it's not impossible, I'm sure I could make `sed` skip sections for `pp`, but the end result would be even more of a complicated mess of a shell script than the one I have now. I really don't want to deal with something like that when it's not that much of a chore, in the grand scheme of things, to maintain it manually.
2021-03-09T20:04:00Z	(#<k3qmxgq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=k3qmxgq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I really appreciate your help but as I said in my blog post, I just need to make my own generator in a real programming language if I want it to be exactly right for my website.  > Depends on what you understand by "mess" and "complicated" It's 55 lines long and I'm having trouble understanding it as I read through it, less than a week after it was written.

2021-03-09T20:15:22Z	(#<jatw6pq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jatw6pq>) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> I'm sorry, I hope you didn't take offense to my reply. It wasn't a great choice of words. I didn't mean to imply anything, I just wanted to offer some help.
2021-03-09T20:17:49Z	(#<k3qmxgq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=k3qmxgq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Thanks. Blank line under the quote, noted.
2021-03-10T21:35:25Z	(#<m3z7bsa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=m3z7bsa>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Big fire, wiped out one datacenter, damaged another. https://www.ovh.ie/news/press/cpl1786.fire-our-strasbourg-site https://nitter.42l.fr/OVHcloud_UK

All we can hope for is that enough frogs in the hot water reach the same conclusion.

A web of trust is much more concrete, based on a single standard that changes, if at all, very mildly. 'Proof of Woke' is a standard that frequently makes wild shifts, which is why high-profile nodes are dropped from the swarm so frequently.
2021-03-12T00:28:31Z	(#<rv6jlca https://twtxt.net/search?tag=rv6jlca>) If they don't plan on doing a bunch of invasive garbage to stop people from doing what they want with the computer part they own, then the whole thing looks like a tremendous blunder. The only problem is, while Nvidia's executives do have a certain deficiency of IQ points, I doubt this is the end. They will start adding invasive garbage, and we can expect the experience of GNU/Linux users with Nvidia cards to diminish even further as a result. I predict we'll be seeing mod chips for graphics cards within two generations if they keep this up.

You can run a [free OS](https://www.rockbox.org/) on them, and storage can go up to 2TB if you have the right model iPod, 4 512GB MicroSD cards, and an [iFlash Quad](https://www.iflash.xyz/store/iflash-quad/). I use a 5th gen iPod running Rockbox every day.

It doesn't actually wipe the stock OS, though. You can still boot into iPod OS by turning on the hold switch when booting. iPods were much, much more open back then.
2021-03-31T02:00:42Z	Hey @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, I think feeds are being removed from my following list. I've certainly followed more than seven people, because I click "follow" on almost everyone involved in conversations here. Users I am very sure that I have followed here include @<xjix https://xj-ix.luxe/.well-known/twtxt/xjix.txt> and my main feed on mckinley.cc which I just followed for the third time. I am fairly sure I've followed @<lazarus https://twtxt.net/user/lazarus/twtxt.txt> and @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> as well.

2021-03-31T06:15:55Z	(#<w7kpceq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=w7kpceq>) No need to apologize, I was just curious. Thank you very much for looking into it. I know you're a busy guy.

People I know have had issues with messages syncing between devices. Plus, the only client I've been able to find is the official Electron one. I would probably be using Signal if it didn't require the use of a tracking device (smartphone) or a phone number.

Take the same people, add in nonfree JavaScript, unnecessary accounts on a web service because you own a tractor or something, and assorted forms of tracking and you get this. Seriously, though, I really don't know how username enumeration like this leads to locations of users.

Most code they run is proprietary, so it's difficult to know. Monitoring network traffic only goes so far. Better to avoid the suspicious proprietary software altogether if you can, in my opinion.
2021-04-25T23:19:27Z	(#<jmr7rbq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jmr7rbq>) For life? That's a shame. I hope the maintainers reconsider that in a year or two. To my knowledge, @umn.edu email addresses didn't make up the majority of known malicious patches.

If banning the whole school for a while is the only thing that would make them knock it off, then so be it. I just don't think it should be permanent.

2021-09-07T03:26:51Z	I wonder if one could make a vanity (v3) onion address generator that, instead of looking for a small set of user-defined prefixes, looked for a prefix based on three or four short dictionary words from a long list instead. You would be able to have a prefix that's easily recognizable by users to make sure they're at the right address but it would still be very difficult for someone to brute force an address with the same prefix.
2021-09-07T03:33:51Z	@<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> (#<thv6jya https://twtxt.net/search?tag=thv6jya>) For example, `examplexpi...z2j.onion` would be difficult for me to generate but it would be equally difficult for someone who wants to pretend to be that service to generate `example6yf...9wn.onion`. Instead, I might be able to generate something like `wellhairrainba7...m4c.onion` based on a list of random words. The other guy would need to find an address with a set 12 character prefix. That would be much more difficult than the 7 character example from before.
2021-09-07T03:49:29Z	@<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> (#<thv6jya https://twtxt.net/search?tag=thv6jya>) The obvious potential pitfall is the computational expense of comparing generated addresses to possible combinations of a large word list. It would be interesting to see how this compares to the brute force method in practice.
2021-09-07T04:31:54Z	(#<thv6jya https://twtxt.net/search?tag=thv6jya>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Wikipedia can explain onion addresses better than I can: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion A "vanity address" is made by generating thousands of keypairs until you find one that corresponds with an onion address that has the first few characters matching a given string. A well known example would be the archive.today hidden service, http://archiveiya74codqgiixo33q62qlrqtkgmcitqx5u2oeqnmn5bpcbiyd.onion/
2021-09-07T04:37:06Z	(#<thv6jya https://twtxt.net/search?tag=thv6jya>) @<lohn https://tw.lohn.in/user/lohn/twtxt.txt> I didn't know mkp224o had that option, but I think doing it with long words will be impractical. The difficulty goes up drastically as you add words, and 5 characters is already difficult to generate. Take a look at these generation times on a cluster of 5 raspberry pis: https://www.jamieweb.net/blog/onionv3-vanity-address/#generation-times Someone much smarter than I could probably calculate the increase in difficulty based on word length.

It's the same basic idea as [Typosquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting). My idea, in theory, would make it easier (less computationally expensive) to generate an address with a certain prefix the first time, and much harder to do a second time.

It won't really make a difference to me. As of about 6 months ago, 3 different yarn.social pods each request /twtxt.txt (with an If-Modified-Since header) every 5 minutes, 24 / 7. I think I also had a different twtxt client requesting it every 10 minutes.

The two feeds are different. Most of my original posts are on my website's feed (in 140 characters or less) and I use this one mostly for interacting with others.  I keep two feeds because, while I really enjoy what the dev.twtxt.net spec extensions and yarn.social pods have to offer, I also like the effect of the original twtxt specification.
2021-09-14T03:37:35Z	(#<mhmaxsa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=mhmaxsa>) From a conversation a little while ago: > Twtxt’s original spec is like taking a 140 character long string of text, loading it into a cannon, and shooting it off into space. I like that idea, which is why I keep a separate feed on my website. Yarn is a whole different concept, it adds a lot of the “social” elements back into twtxt.  Search engine works great, by the way. :)

The money was sent, but the domain wasn't showing up on my account. Later, the money was refunded to me and mc.cz was listed for sale as a "Premium" domain for several thousand dollars.

2021-10-06T07:01:17Z	I managed to make a template for `pp` that produces an HTML list of twts for a given twtxt file, similar to the way I have it on [my website](https://mckinley.cc/twtxt/2021-aug-dec.html). It even turns HTTP URLs into hyperlinks. It definitely needs some work, but I think I've reached the limit of POSIX sh. I don't know of any way to compare dates or change the format of a timestamp without GNU `date`. `rev` isn't a POSIX utility either so I can't have reverse chronological order without doing some `awk` sorcery or something.

Apologies, I always get the two mixed up. What I want to do is automate the HTMLized twtxt pages on my website. I'll need to remove comments, sort the feed chronologically which can definitely be done with `sort`, and then separate the feed into three month periods. Then I'll pass that three month chunk into `pp` which will use the template to generate HTML. I'll need dateutils or something similar to separate the feed into blocks as well as changing the date format to something more readable for the HTML.
2021-10-06T21:16:03Z	(#<golikrq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=golikrq>) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> There is absolutely no question that this is not a job for a shell script. I've gone this far out of a want to use `pp` for something useful but now I don't think it's possible to properly escape backslashes in twts without the use of temporary files. I'm thinking this one might have to be put in the folder of purgatory with the rest.

The only thing is that you only get one page of results. 99% of the time, though, the 20 or so results on that page are close enough to what I'm looking for. The image search is very nice. The image resolution is printed right there on the image matrix. There are good search options available like a "Transparent" image type which I've only seen on DuckDuckGo before. Searching for text is completely usable with JavaScript disabled but it needs to be enabled for image search.

It also has no -r option (print in reverse), since reversing a file is really a different job from printing the end of a file; BSD tail (which is the one with -r) can only reverse files that are at most as large as its buffer, which is typically 32 KiB. A more reliable and versatile way to reverse files is the GNU tac command.

2021-10-09T21:20:35Z	(#u4bhkvq) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> > I assumed all lines start with a date  So did I in my attempt, but even after a quick `grep -v '^#'` it would still break everything. I'm trying out the newer version now. Will report back.
2021-10-09T22:07:46Z	(#u4bhkvq) I don't see much a difference between the new version and the old version. There are a couple of small bugs I've seen. "2021: January-April" is hard-coded into the twt page template as well as the date "27 April 2021 01:04" for each twt. The timestamps are also printed along with the twt because it just copies the line through. What is `smu` used for?
2021-10-09T22:13:25Z	(#u4bhkvq) My template ([most recent copy](https://clbin.com/5g9kS)) attempts to solve the latter two problems, but I think it's another job for `awk` to avoid the dumpster fire below.  ``` timestamp=$(echo "$line" | grep -Eo '^[0-9]{4}-[01][0-9]-[0-3][0-9][Tt][0-2][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9](\.[0-9]+)?([+-][0-2][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]|Zz)') twt=$(echo "$line" | sed -e 's/"/\"/g; s/```/\`/g' | cut -f 2- -) hyperlinked=$(echo "$twt" | sed 's|http://[^ ]*[^ ,.;:)>}!]|<a href="&">&</a>|g; s|https://[^ ]*[^ ,.;:)>}!]|<a href="&">&</a>|g') ```
2021-10-09T22:19:06Z	(#u4bhkvq) It looks like I just have no idea what I'm doing, and that's partially true, but those are the best solutions I was able to get while conforming to POSIX (without awk). I'll take the time at some point to learn more about awk and come up with a better solution for this.
2021-10-09T22:27:14Z	(#dlpfxuq) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Yes, I got `smu` installed to run the script and I figured that markdown was being generated somewhere but I don't know where that is or what purpose it serves.

2021-10-31T03:25:02Z	(#ba3fxtq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> You're correct, but those are actually separate feeds. Green is /twtxt.txt, my "canonical" feed with all my posts. Blue is /twtxt-25.txt, the one with only the most recent 25 posts. I understand how this can create confusion. Does Yarn respect [url](https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/metadataextension.html#url) metadata entries as specified on dev.twtxt.net?

2021-10-31T03:29:45Z	(#ba3fxtq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Man, you're really killing me with these quick replies.
2021-10-31T03:32:36Z	(#ba3fxtq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, isn't the idea to make sure twts from the same feed at different locations have the same hash by specifying a canonical feed url? That should solve the http:// https:// problem *and* the twtxt twtxt-25 problem if the standard is widely adopted.
2021-10-31T03:47:40Z	(#ba3fxtq) Hold on. If the standard was implemented verbatim, couldn't anyone could hijack your feed by adding `# url = https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt` to their feed?
2021-10-31T03:58:10Z	(#ba3fxtq) How about this: The `url` field is replaced by a `canonical` field and an `alternate` field. If the location that the client has of Feed A doesn't match what it says in Feed A's `canonical` field, the client downloads the canonical feed, Feed B, once to make sure that the location of Feed A appears in Feed B's `alternate` tags. If so, the client will continue to follow Feed A but it will use the canonical URL for hashing. As I'm typing it, though, it seems like an extremely complicated solution to a problem that isn't all that bad.
2021-10-31T04:00:17Z	(#ba3fxtq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  > Hijack it how?  Wouldn't they be able to make their own posts that would appear as having come from your account?
2021-10-31T04:02:17Z	(#ba3fxtq) > As I'm typing it, though, it seems like an extremely complicated solution to a problem that isn't all that bad.  Poor wording. Feedjacking would be a pretty bad problem. I meant that it might be best to keep things as they are without adding any crazy url switching.
2021-10-31T04:13:36Z	(#ba3fxtq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> My apologies. I didn't interpret the specification correctly. The feeds are supposed to be distinct, with the url field used for hashing and hashing only. I got carried away with separate feeds becoming one and whatnot. Ignore everything I've written to this point. Perhaps I should go to bed.

2021-11-11T19:08:07Z	(#k3mizra) I agree with @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> There could be some confusion if posts appear in people's clients that are not on the master feed. What if the client keeps retrying and keeps getting the dummy feed over the course of several hours? It would clutter people's clients very quickly. This is a perfect use for the standard HTTP status codes, there's no reason to reinvent the wheel.

2021-11-14T17:50:59Z	(#lrmnw3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Whenever I have some pictures I need to share with a few others, I just put them on a web page somewhere that isn't linked anywhere else and has `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, ofollow">` on for good measure. Nobody I'm sharing it with has to sign up for anything, no entity outside my control is compressing the images, screwing with the metadata, or facially recognizing anyone, and you can just right click > save as if you want to download them.
2021-11-14T17:59:13Z	(#lrmnw3a) I think it would be a much harder sell to get people on a weird social media service they've never heard of and encrypted feeds (as well as signed feeds) would make clients much more complex. I always have the anti-feature view, though. Maybe there's something I'm not seeing.
2021-11-14T18:04:34Z	(#nfogdjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I just don't have a good idea for one.
2021-11-14T21:26:23Z	(#lrmnw3a) Reading this thread, I see two things: 1. The example of image sharing can easily be solved by creating a private file hosting service that doesn't suck like @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> said 2. We are getting close to the original purpose of Facebook here. A social media service based on identities rather than accounts and designed for people who know each other in meatspace to connect online. Facebook already does what we're talking about well; it has strong access controls to only show your content to people you choose. The only problem, of course, is that Facebook is evil.
2021-11-14T21:49:32Z	(#lrmnw3a) "Social media" can take several forms. - A "Twitter style" open microblogging system that allows people to discard and create identities with little consequences - A "Facebook style" closed-off system that is more focused on real people interacting with each other instead of their online personas - An "Internet forum style" system that focuses on discussion above all else
2021-11-14T21:52:56Z	(#lrmnw3a) Twtxt and Yarn are designed as "Twitter style" systems. Perhaps twtxt can be adapted to a Facebook style system with that kind of access control and end-to-end encryption. Perhaps the result would be incredible. I am skeptical, however, of the idea that it would mix well with the current twtxt/Yarn ecosystem built on openness.

2021-12-01T06:48:07Z	(#wt5j2xq) I am not familiar with the functionality of Telegram or Signal, but things I have heard about both make me skeptical of their entries in this document. Signal requires a phone number to sign up, and I believe that you can connect it to your contact list on your phone to find other people using Signal. If this is the case, wouldn't they have to store at least a hash of your phone number? Hashed information is listed elsewhere in the document.
2021-12-01T06:48:15Z	(#wt5j2xq) From what I've heard about Telegram, you have to explicitly enable end-to-end encryption with another person and you can't do that in group chats.

2022-02-08T20:36:13Z	@<deebs https://twtxt.net/user/deebs/twtxt.txt> Watch out for websites reviewing VPNs because many of them are owned by the same companies that operate the VPN services. I use Mullvad and I've heard good things about iVPN. They're very similar. Both have Australian servers. Neither of them require any personal information. Both accept cryptocurrency. Both claim they don't keep logs. Both have GPLv3 official clients but support standard OpenVPN or Wireguard clients. Both also support port forwarding. Mullvad is a bit cheaper unless you pay for long-term service with iVPN's standard plan.

What if `yarnd` and a separate federated chat server could (optionally) share account information so your Yarn account credentials are used for a Matrix or XMPP account on the same server?
2022-03-11T04:39:53Z	(#2xsbljq) This is a very direct and understandable answer to the question, from both of you. At risk of irony, I think one of you should copy this thread and host it somewhere permanently so we can reference it later. I would, but I wasn't involved in the conversation.

2022-03-12T01:23:11Z	(#kg2ghea) Is anyone interested in the puzzle? Is it just too difficult?
2022-03-12T01:39:40Z	(#3bwkpna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I didn't know the rotation was already implemented in `yarnd`. Is there a way to see the full history of a feed? I don't see a `prev` metadata tag on yours.
2022-03-12T01:55:59Z	(#kg2ghea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> CyberChef is a tool that does all kinds of file conversion and you can make "recipes" that perform several operations in a row on the input. That string in the root post, which is exactly the twt length limit of this pod, is a string of text that has gone through several reversible CyberChef text operations. If you want to give it a try, you need to use the hints I've given in this thread, the tools available in CyberChef, and any information you uncover along the way to deduce the original string. To get you started, the first format is base64. `:`
2022-03-12T01:59:04Z	(#3bwkpna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> No worries. It doesn't affect me much, I'm just curious.
2022-03-12T02:02:34Z	(#lmpza6q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It was really cool clicking on the link to the netbros.com pod and seeing my 28 second old post on twtxt.net at the top of the feed. That WebSub thing is great!
2022-03-12T03:48:49Z	(#wtbgvea) @<mutefall https://twtxt.net/user/mutefall/twtxt.txt> I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.

2022-03-12T23:39:41Z	(#wtbgvea) @<mutefall https://twtxt.net/user/mutefall/twtxt.txt> Ah, yes. Glad it made you smile.
2022-03-13T02:19:45Z	(#ef4r53a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Oh, that's clean. Nice setup.
2022-03-13T06:31:34Z	(#razpnla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> As long as people's complete post history is stored in their twtxt file(s), anyone with a client that isn't `yarnd` can see old posts. They can even reconstruct old conversations. There is no plausible deniability there, unless you're proposing we remove the non-cached posts permanently. I'm definitely not a fan of that.
2022-03-13T06:41:06Z	(#ttofg7a) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> That's definitely the best minifigure-scale model of a real car I've seen. I might have to go find one of those.
2022-03-14T01:11:32Z	(#najpaha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> 30 seconds is reasonable. Even a little more would be fine, I think. It's only really annoying when someone's time is set so far into the future that it's effectively a "sticky" post at the top of the Discover feed for a while.
2022-03-15T02:26:36Z	(#2cdijnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  I'm glad you found my idea compelling. I agree that the broker and client specifications shouldn't be lumped together. I also think there should be a clear separation between client-to-server and server-to-server connections. The distinction between sending a message (`POST http://montague.example/api/base/v1/post`) and delivering a message (`POST http://capulet.example/api/base/v1/inbox`) should absolutely be enforced by the specification. I didn't see that last night, but it became clear after thinking about it.
2022-03-15T02:34:46Z	(#2cdijnq) The server operator should be able to blacklist certain hosts as well as disable s2s connections entirely if they don't want federation. If a client can POST inboxes without a broker in the middle of the chain, it's too easy to automate and too hard to prevent spam.
2022-03-15T05:49:45Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Re: Chat system, What if the base specification included a system for per-user arbitrary JSON storage on the server? Kind of like [XEP-0049](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0049.html), but expanded upon. Two kinds of objects: public and private. Public objects can be queried by anyone, private objects cannot and must be encrypted with the user's private key. Public keys could be stored there, as well as anything else defined by extensions. Roster, user block list, avatar, etc.
2022-03-15T19:54:25Z	(#5nagu7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yes, but I was thinking more along the lines of auxiliary data like contact lists. Message history might be better off with its own system that provides more powerful query options and pagination. Do you think it would be feasible to encrypt the private object names as well?
2022-03-15T20:25:49Z	(#funiitq) @<the-lunduke-journal-of-technology https://feeds.twtxt.net/the-lunduke-journal-of-technology/twtxt.txt> Oh, this is neat. I definitely need to get one of these at some point. Normally I would avoid being on the bleeding edge of hardware like this, but the DevTerm is fully upgradeable. You can even buy a Risc-V DevTerm kit and swap in an ARM based core module later, which absolutely blows my mind.
2022-03-15T20:43:05Z	(#fkl353q) @<jsreed5 gemini://jsreed5.org/feeds/twtxt.txt> (200ms read)  Agreed.
2022-03-16T01:13:04Z	(#5nagu7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The way I picture this, and I may be way off from where you are, the client needs to be able to make the following requests for messages: 1. All messages from and to all users sent after X date (when starting up) 2. All messages from and to a specific user sent before Y date (when viewing history)  All of this would need to utilize pagination so we aren't sending 500 messages to a client all at once. These query options could be added to the JSON object store I'm proposing, but I don't see how they might be used outside of storing messages.
2022-03-16T02:01:05Z	(#5nagu7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Wait, I've been assuming that one account = one private key. Is that not your intention? If the same private key is used on all devices, a new client should be able to see old messages. That's not the model of XMPP+OMEMO, and it may be a challenge to use mobile devices as well as "real" computers with the same account, but it wouldn't be insurmountable. If one account = one private key it makes the private JSON store much less complicated. It would streamline group chats as well, which is a problem for XMPP+OMEMO.
2022-03-16T02:40:17Z	(#5nagu7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I do the same with SSH keys and share that exception. I would also prefer to have a separate IM account for work. The only advantages I can think of to a device key setup are as follows: 1. You can verify that a device key belongs to the person to whom you mean to send messages. If you verify the keys with someone in person and suddenly start receiving messages from their account with a different key, you'll know something's going on. 2. It's easier to register new clients, because you can just type in a username and a password.
2022-03-16T02:46:35Z	(#5nagu7q) If a username and a private key is all that's needed to sign in and there is no username/password/TOFU then an impersonation attack like that would be equivalent to the attacker grabbing an OMEMO private key from a trusted device, is it not? Point #<1 https://twtxt.net/search?tag=1> would effectively become irrelevant, right? Plus, how many people are *really* meeting up in person to verify their OMEMO keys?
2022-03-16T02:54:33Z	(#5nagu7q) I have a very weak understanding of cryptography, I'm sure there's something I'm missing.
2022-03-16T21:15:01Z	There are too many threads going, I can't keep up. Can someone catch me up on what's been going on here since last night?
2022-03-17T00:43:36Z	(#yo2bebq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I tried both views in Settings and still couldn't make much sense of it. I'll check them out later tonight.
2022-03-17T20:44:35Z	Ah yes, [email protected], my favorite Salty user. What is the actual goal of Cloudflare MITMing everyone to censor websites? If the owner of a website chooses to publish an email address, why can't he? If it gets scraped by bots and the inbox gets ruined forever, that's on him. Is it just to get people used to this sort of "voluntary" MITM attack? I put "voluntary" in quotes because I, the victim of this MITM attack, didn't volunteer, the owner of the website did.

Even we probably can't imagine the extent of it. @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, thank you for turning that off. It was even [email protecting] version numbers at the bottom of the page.
2022-03-18T05:20:18Z	(#2q7r4xa) I'm still seeing [email protected] on docs.mills.io, it's making it confusing to read the Salty specification.
2022-03-18T06:25:46Z	(#kvnawmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm having a hard time understanding this. If I wanted to create the ID `mckinley@mckinley.cc`, would I have to run an instance of the broker *on* mckinley.cc or could I use any broker server? If the latter is true, it's a little misleading to say I'm mckinley *at* mckinley.cc.
2022-03-18T06:53:39Z	(#kvnawmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's misleading because my communications aren't coming from the server that the domain mckinley.cc points to. Here, I'm mckinley@twtxt.net because my twtxt feed is on twtxt.net. I wouldn't really be McKinley *at* mckinley.cc using Salty. I would be McKinley, somewhere else. All it would signify is that I am somehow affiliated with the domain. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just strange to me and I've never seen a service do that.
2022-03-18T06:57:00Z	(#kvnawmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm sorry. At the moment, I'm set up for neither videos nor calls. I'm going to bed in a few minutes, anyway.

2022-03-20T00:56:11Z	Hello from NomadBSD. I'm very impressed with this system. It's much more polished than I would ever expect a BSD to be. It has a huge library of software preinstalled, covering just about everything I do personally. It even has programs you wouldn't expect to be there by default like mpv, KeePassXC, mupdf, and qpdf. Firefox even comes with uBlock Origin preinstalled!

2022-03-22T01:33:03Z	Hey @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt>, are you still self-hosting your Git repositories? My repository archival script has been unable to pull from git.andrewjvpowell.com for some time and https://git.andrewjvpowell.com/ shows an nginx 502 error.
2022-03-22T05:46:06Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think you changed a pod setting so external links would change to /linkVerify. I should be able to stop this with the "Link Verification" option in Settings, right? I even tried clearing cookies and logging back in and the option is definitely disabled for my account but the links are still changed.
2022-03-22T06:02:40Z	(#lmypwla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I don't know what is and is not logged by default, but this makes it easy for a pod admin to track what his users click on. I stopped using DuckDuckGo when I learned that they do this.
2022-03-22T06:10:03Z	(#lmypwla) Here is a regex rule for the [Redirector](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector) browser extension that bypasses /linkVerify on any domain, not just twtxt.net. False positives are possible but extremely unlikely. https://ttm.sh/iaR.json
2022-03-22T06:21:07Z	(#6z3uata) I know I tried removing the character limit in the inspector but I thought it didn't work and the server truncated my post. 1024 is a nice, round number. It probably shouldn't be much higher than that because at a certain point it goes from a "microblog" to just a "blog".
2022-03-22T06:36:11Z	(#lmypwla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I trust you a lot more than the people who run DuckDuckGo. I see where you guys are coming from, I'm just very skeptical of the efficacy of this kind of system. People will get in the habit of clicking the big blue button immediately and then it's just an annoyance, offering no protection whatsoever. Not to mention it's a unique URL for each link that can easily be tracked by a pod admin.
2022-03-22T08:02:16Z	(#lmypwla) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I don't think you're being argumentative. I hope I'm not coming off as such either. I didn't consider mobile users, and something like this makes a lot more sense on a device that doesn't just let you hover over the link to see where it goes. Sure, a pod owner could modify `yarnd` to track users, but this is has always been a very privacy focused service by default. Privacy focused to the point that it only stores a hash of the user's email address so it's impossible for a pod owner to see it unless the user attempts to recover his account.
2022-03-22T08:03:38Z	(#lmypwla) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> On the desktop, at least, it seems like there is very little benefit. Anyone concerned with clicking on a malicious link will hover over it and check the bottom corner before clicking. Those who aren't concerned, even though they should be, will just click the big blue button no matter what. At best, it's an annoyance. At worst, it's allowing the pod owner to play Zuckerberg with his users.
2022-03-22T08:13:32Z	(#lmypwla) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> > Thank you for your feedback and hopefully these features won’t be a deterrent from using Yarn.social.  You don't need to talk to me like a customer, let's just have a regular conversation.

2022-03-22T18:38:03Z	(#3kwlwda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That's a good idea. If it's done in JavaScript, mobile devices can be detected using `navigator.userAgent`. Depending on how far you're willing to go with it, the entire prompt can be constructed locally, so the URL is never revealed to anyone else.
2022-03-23T04:58:10Z	Does anyone know of some kind of plaintext file format to store metadata on a collection of other files?

2022-03-23T07:55:08Z	(#nsgxtsa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I've been toying with the idea of creating my own format for a couple of days.

2022-03-28T19:29:10Z	(#zfpe5qa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> It is inexcusable to force people to link the computer that they paid for with a cloud service. Even if there are [super hacky ways to avoid it](https://www.askvg.com/tip-how-to-install-windows-11-with-local-user-account/) people should not stand for it. That goes for Chrome OS too, which is arguably worse because it's Google spying on you and not Microsoft. Although, a Chrome OS machine is much less useful than a Windows machine, so I guess it balances itself out.
2022-03-28T19:33:38Z	(#zfpe5qa) I'll bet, if polled, a vast majority of Windows users either are neutral or actively dislike that they have to connect their OS to their Microsoft account. Nobody actually likes it, except Microsoft. What legitimate features does that bring, anyway?

2022-04-17T01:09:02Z	(#nv7jn7q) A landline phone, or even a mobile phone that never leaves the house, mitigates this kind of tracking almost entirely. I haven't carried my cell phone regularly for years. It just stays at home. Anyone with the means to track me this way already knows where I live. Besides, I don't give anyone my phone number unless I intend to talk to them and I've avoided two factor authentication pretty well. When I decide to start using a service that requires two factor authentication over SMS, I'll use one of those anonymous services that take Monero.
2022-04-17T01:40:28Z	(#nv7jn7q) @<mutefall https://twtxt.net/user/mutefall/twtxt.txt> That's admirable and a good point. My phone is really only used for calls and the occasional text message, and I don't even connect it to my home network.
2022-04-17T03:33:04Z	I keep getting Cloudflared when connecting via Tor. :/ Creating a new circuit fixes it for a while, though.

2022-04-17T04:33:15Z	(#lmyjfma) Okay, it must be keyword based. I lost the reply text and I had to remake it to post it here and Cloudflare blocked me.
2022-04-17T04:36:57Z	(#3p5hajq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I appreciate that but it's not necessary. I'm using *the amnesic incognito live system* anyway, so it would be a chore to enable the admin *secret text* and edit *the hosts file* on every boot. Most *orange cloud*-enabled *common net* sites I try to use over *the onion router* give me a lot more trouble.

2022-04-20T03:41:44Z	(#zf5dtfq) @<novaburst https://twt.nfld.uk/user/novaburst/twtxt.txt> @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> The best Web browser is NetSurf, but it's not a practical daily driver yet. ;) My problem with Webkit based browsers like Otter Browser or Surf is a lack of powerful extension support. Some of them come with an integrated content blocker but I use extensions for more than that. Once one of them has an equivalent to uBlock Origin and uMatrix and lets me make regex redirect rules (like `^https?://([A-Za-z0-9\-]+\.)?medium\.com/(.+)$` -> https://$1scribe.rip/$2) then I'll consider using it daily. Until then, I think Librewolf and ungoogled-chromium (with the Chromium Web Store extension) are the least worst.
2022-04-20T22:12:36Z	(#zf5dtfq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> It's worth mentioning that Brave and Waterfox Classic are spyware according to Spyware Watchdog: https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/brave.html https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/waterfox_classic.html Both have a spyware level of "High". For Waterfox Classic, the article is titled "Waterfox Classic" but it frequently mentions "Waterfox". It's unclear to me which browser is being tested for the article, but if one is spyware, the other probably is too. ungoogled-chromium is Not Spyware, and Librewolf barely has a spyware level of "Low" because it makes a request to the Mozilla safe browsing service and tries to auto-update uBlock Origin. Those requests can be disabled. https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/ungoogled_chromium.html https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/librewolf.html

2022-04-24T04:53:47Z	What news aggregators do you all use? I am looking for one that has no integrated web engine and an easy way to open an entry in a Web browser or in mpv. I don't want to have to choose one or the other.
2022-04-26T01:42:44Z	(#rynwiqq) @<will https://twtxt.net/user/will/twtxt.txt> In fairness, Discord does include features that are unavailable on IRC and the barrier to entry in mitigating that, like setting up a bouncer, is much higher than signing into Discord. @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> is right, though. Discord is a privacy eroding centralized pile of crap. There isn't a single worthwhile, libre alternative to Discord, but a Mumble server combined with an XMPP server comes close.
2022-04-26T03:44:03Z	(#rynwiqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Discord has a highly efficient core design. IRC-like text channels and Mumble-like voice channels (+video/screen sharing), all in one hierarchy, with a good permissions system tying it all together. There's also a DM system and you can add people to a simple group chat. All of that technology was available before Discord, but I think they were the first to stitch it all together in a coherent, intuitive manner.  I used Discord for several years, but I finally broke away from it entirely about a year ago. The only Free alternative other than Matrix that comes close, at least that I know of, is Revolt. I have several gripes about the project, though, that I won't dive into right now. There won't be federation, for one.
2022-04-27T06:57:11Z	(#rynwiqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> For people like us, they are. But, in order to create alternatives for the general public and lift them out of the walled garden, we need to understand why so many people chose Discord in the first place.
2022-04-27T06:58:50Z	(#j3v736q) @<tel https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/tel/twtxt.txt> I forgot about Fosscord. They've made quite a bit of progress since I last looked into the project. Maybe I should give it a try.
2022-04-28T04:37:15Z	(#qhzlyaq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Absolutely. Many people will admit that Discord isn't a good thing to use but they use it anyway because their friends are on there. I've seen many such cases.
2022-04-28T05:15:03Z	(#ntdlo7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I would argue that the good outweighs the bad when it comes to viable cryptocurrencies like Monero. The ability to anonymously send real money in any amount to any person on the planet within an hour, all the while completely bypassing fiat currencies and the global financial system, is a good thing for society. I like [Goldbacks](https://goldback.com/) too for a similar reason. :)
2022-04-28T05:55:12Z	(#l3fhzqq) Thank you all for the suggestions. I settled on Newsboat. You can set a macro to make mpv the browser, open the selected item in the browser, and change it back. It's a bit of a hack, but it works. In ~/.newsboat/config: ``` macro m set browser "mpv --no-terminal %u &" ; open-in-browser ; set browser "xdg-open %u" -- "Open in MPV" ``` It even appears in the help menu with a helpful description.  @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> @<will https://twtxt.net/user/will/twtxt.txt> @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I hope you gentlemen don't follow my RSS feed then.

2022-05-01T02:00:59Z	(#kpmv52a) Funny, I just installed a Vim keys extension for my web browser. No turning back now!
2022-05-01T02:15:11Z	(#kpmv52a) @<novaburst https://twt.nfld.uk/user/novaburst/twtxt.txt> Extension support. I use them, well, extensively.  @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I see lots of things with vi keybindings, but I can't recall seeing a program advertise "emacs keybindings". Emacs does have keybindings, though. Lots of them.
2022-05-01T02:18:58Z	(#kpmv52a) Man, I keep trying to use vim keys in the text box. It's hurting my brain!
2022-05-01T02:42:07Z	(#btcevjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Everything I can find is either for Firefox versions <57 or it literally opens Vim to edit text inputs. The extension I'm using, Tridactyl, literally opens Vim if you install the "native client" which is a separate piece of helper software that goes with the browser extension. Tridactyl is Firefox only, though, and you seem like a Chromium man to me.
2022-05-01T03:13:16Z	(#btcevjq) @<novaburst https://twt.nfld.uk/user/novaburst/twtxt.txt> I meant to say "native messenger". That's what Tridactyl calls the helper program, and it's written in Nim. It's needed for certain features that can't be implemented in a standalone browser extension. https://github.com/tridactyl/native_messenger
2022-05-01T05:25:02Z	(#kpmv52a) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> Vimperator is for versions <57 only. I am using [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) on Librewolf and it works well.
2022-05-02T03:26:59Z	(#kpmv52a) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> Librewolf has very good defaults in my opinion, and they have [excellent](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq) [user documentation](https://librewolf.net/docs/features) detailing what is different from upstream Firefox. It has a spyware rating of [low](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/librewolf.html) from Spyware Watchdog because of a few benign outgoing connections, and the FAQ is [honest](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq/#does-librewolf-make-any-outgoing-connections=) about what those connections are and why they're made.  Sure, I could use Firefox and spend hours of my time disabling all the garbage they put in, testing it with mitmproxy, and keeping up with changes that need to be made every update. I've done it before, but I would rather use something that is reasonably secure by default and isn't trying to get me to sign up for a VPN or donate money to some political cause.
2022-05-02T03:28:17Z	(#kpmv52a) Wow, I've completely hijacked this thread. Sorry @<novaburst https://twt.nfld.uk/user/novaburst/twtxt.txt>!

It all uses a crappy crypto coin for some reason, and the whole thing is effectively centralized like every other "decentralized *x* using blockchain" project. Plus, Odysee tracks you.

2022-05-04T01:35:15Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, I think it's about time I try out Salty. I followed from the instructions on the website, and it [didn't go too well](https://clbin.com/DV5Ja). I suspect it's because the local path from my JSON file (`/01G268YYHWGNYT9M1M9760KP83`) on mckinley.cc doesn't return anything because I don't have a broker set up there.  I seem to have registered mckinley@mills.io when experimenting with it, but I didn't know until recently because of [a very confusing output](https://clbin.com/xMDKz). That account does exist, though, because it shows up when using `salty-chat lookup`.  TL;DR: I want to try Salty. I'm very confused. Would you mind if I use your broker for now? Is there a way to do that and still be mckinley@mckinley.cc? If not, could you delete mckinley@mills.io so I can register it again? That private key is long gone.
2022-05-04T02:53:10Z	(#5535xyq) Thank you for the thorough reply. It looks like I set my SRV records correctly and registered on your server with my domain, but I get the [same error](https://clbin.com/pE8ND) when I try to send you a message.  How can I completely remove salty-chat and its dependencies and start over from scratch?
2022-05-04T03:18:20Z	(#5535xyq) > I assume you created the Well-Known JSON config file on your web server at the top-level of your domain?  Yes, it was there for previous attempts, created exactly as `salty-chat make-user` told me to each time. I have since deleted that file from my web server, hoping it would fix the crash on the current attempt, but no dice.
2022-05-04T03:42:36Z	(#5535xyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> No need to apologize, and take your time.

You don't need anything to run a Tor hidden service except for a machine to run it on. The only downsides are speed, ping, and the relative difficulty for others to use the service.  No matter what, if you're going to self-host on your home network, take proper security precautions. Look into isolating the server on a VLAN so it can't talk to the other devices on your local network, minimize bloat, enable a firewall, and keep your software updated to start.

When the network grows and it gets impossible to keep up, we'll have to learn about new feeds organically. Reposting can help with that. It's at least something to think about.

Web+ works wonderfully, even features requiring JavaScript work well. The only problem I've run into is that icons don't load.  Otter Browser doesn't respect the user's theme properly and all the text is serifed, NetSurf supports just enough CSS to make it almost unusable, and Falkon won't launch.

2022-05-12T23:05:55Z	(#5hr6s3q) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> Fair enough. That's why I didn't open an issue about it. Web+ is based on WebKit, but there aren't sufficient dev tools so it's annoying to troubleshoot on. Maybe later I'll try a nightly image of Haiku and see if the situation improves.

My message was still in the reply box. I copied the text to the clipboard, pressed Ctrl+Shift+R (to reload with a clear cache), and tried to send the message again. Same error. I went to my timeline at the root of the pod, clicked "Reply" on your twt, pasted the message in, and it worked as normal. I'm using LibreWolf 100.0.2, which should be analogous to Firefox 100.0.2

2022-06-02T06:36:02Z	(#hr4b4tq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I dug around in the code and it looks like Medium has a GraphQL API that is used by Scribe. See [/src/clients/medium_client.cr](https://git.sr.ht/~edwardloveall/scribe/tree/main/item/src/clients/medium_client.cr). Scribe takes the JSON returned by the API and turns it into HTML.  [/src/clients/local_client.cr](https://git.sr.ht/~edwardloveall/scribe/tree/main/item/src/clients/local_client.cr) includes a cURL command that queries the API in a similar way to Scribe. The ID is the unique looking alphanumeric string in the URL. For this post, it's `aad7095d70a`.

2022-06-06T05:25:16Z	(#3s2cdqq) @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> An Android phone is just a computer, and any computer can get malware. The damage that can be caused depends entirely on the level of access that the malware has. It is not all created equal.  Windows' S Mode is an attempt by Microsoft to condition their users into thinking that the manufacturer of their operating system should control what software they are and are not allowed to run. Like Apple and iOS.  If you must use Windows, it is always worth it in my opinion, S Mode or not, to obliterate the default install (and the PC manufacturer's partition containing all *their* spyware) and install the real version from scratch. With Windows 10, the embedded license key for S Mode was valid for the real OS too. I'm not sure if the same is true for 11.
2022-06-07T06:56:56Z	(#3r5tkwa) @<anth http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt> That's an interesting effect. It could be made usable on modern graphical browsers with a few CSS tweaks.

2022-06-07T07:12:38Z	(#wh5ryka) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Monitors and TVs, especially CRTs, can show a ghost image of an object if it was left on the screen too long. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_burn-in#/media/File:Emerson-McDonalds_CNN_Burn-In.jpg)'s an example. The CNN logo is partially visible in the corner of a TV that constantly played CNN, even during a commercial. Burn-in isn't as much of a problem on modern LCDs, though.  @<anth http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt>'s website shows a man page and some source code, partially transparent, behind the main text, like those were burned in to the display.
2022-06-07T07:29:13Z	(#3s2cdqq) @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> Android has a lot of abstraction and security features to prevent access to certain things, but there's always an exploit to get around some of it.  Switching to a Linux based operating system like Ubuntu is not a guarantee that you won't get malware. The only security advantage you get is the fact that you're using a very uncommon system. Security through obscurity isn't real security. That said, it is more profitable to target systems that are used by more people.  The most difficult thing about switching to GNU/Linux is finding replacements for the software you use on Windows. If you want to look into it further, I would recommend Linux Mint instead of Ubuntu. The default user interface would be more familiar to you as a Windows user, and the parent company behind Ubuntu has introduced "features" that spied on their users in the past. https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.en.html
2022-06-07T07:33:30Z	(#3s2cdqq) If you choose to switch, you will run into bugs and other problems. But, if you're willing to seek them out, the fixes are likely available online. The best advice I can give you is to keep backups of your important files.
2022-06-08T17:59:28Z	(#3htkduq) @<rrraksamam https://twtxt.net/user/rrraksamam/twtxt.txt> I believe there is a domain whitelist for inline images that is set on a per-pod basis. Welcome to Yarn, by the way.
2022-06-08T18:11:17Z	(#fabjnoq) @<rrraksamam https://twtxt.net/user/rrraksamam/twtxt.txt> I've only used recent versions for a short time, and it's pretty terrible. The right click menu in the file browser is what really got me.  It has been reduced to just a few options. Most of the things you would actually want to do have been moved to tiny, hard to understand icons with no labels that are hard to differentiate from one another because they use the same few colors. The rest of the menu is an extra click away, like you're not supposed to do anything more complicated. The Windows file manager is now worse than Finder, in my opinion. At least Finder has labels for the right click functions.
2022-06-10T03:44:22Z	(#fabjnoq) @<rrraksamam https://twtxt.net/user/rrraksamam/twtxt.txt> I would recommend staying on 10 for as long as possible. 11 feels more like a toy operating system in which you're not supposed to do anything more complicated than web browsing.

2022-06-11T19:22:44Z	(#weiy6wq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> That's a great point. I remember [this](https://interconnected.org/home/feed) RSS feed that uses an XSLT stylesheet to make it presentable to newcomers. It links to https://aboutfeeds.com/, which is okay but I personally disagree with some of the wording and software choices. It also uses some unnecessary JavaScript served from Cloudflare's CDN.  If I agreed with that website a little more, I might add a link to it on my blog's index page next to the RSS feed. Perhaps I'll write something similar myself.  > Do they do that in the first place or do they just consume what someone else posted on Twitter?  For a lot of folks, it's 100% social media. If they don't see it there, they don't see it. They only see what their preferred social media services want them to see.

2022-06-12T23:38:57Z	(#ji42lkq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> They can be more secure or not. It depends on how long it is, just like a string of random characters. You can also add some random special characters into the passphrase to throw off an attacker.  The main benefit of a passphrase is the relative ease at which it is memorized. A good, long passphrase with a couple of special characters thrown in is quite secure. The list of words that you made your passphrase out of might be public, but the attacker probably doesn't know which one you used unless you tell him.

2022-06-23T05:20:39Z	(#ix5mbfa) @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> How long does the battery last? I'm skeptical of electric yard equipment like that. I had to borrow an electric string trimmer a few weeks ago. Piece of garbage! It struggled to cut through anything, and the battery died in less than 20 minutes. I don't think it was a real inexpensive one, either.  I'll have my real gas one (that would cut your leg off) running by the time the weeds come back.

I couldn't see my messages, and when I run `salty-chat read` I only got one message at a time. I haven't touched it in a long time, though, so maybe things improved.

2022-06-25T06:18:52Z	Great conversation with @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> tonight. Some things we talked about: * Goryon being taken off the Google Play Store * The woes of uppercase ls and Iowercase Ls * De-Googling Android * The Google Glass and how it forced you into the walled garden * iOS and privacy * Privacy legislation and the extent to which people know about the spying * Creepy Amazon stores * The new issue of Lab6 (https://lab6.com/3)
2022-06-25T06:55:56Z	(#cwdgedq) @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> I usually take notes during the call, but today I just went back and skimmed my messages after you hung up.
2022-06-25T19:45:54Z	(#cwdgedq) @<retrocrash https://twtxt.net/user/retrocrash/twtxt.txt> We used the meet.mills.io Peer Calls instance, and I didn't run into any problems. I used Ungoogled Chromium. How was it for you @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt>?
2022-07-02T05:56:35Z	(#n6h4lfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sorry, it totally slipped my mind. I'll be there next week.

2022-07-04T21:24:11Z	(#bj5ng4a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Thank you! I didn't make the ASCII art of the flag. JGS are (presumably) the initials of the person who did. I found it on [this website](https://asciiart.website/joan/www.geocities.com/SoHo/7373/july4.html) and tweaked it a bit to add color.  The stars are open to interpretation. If I made the background blue and the colons white, it didn't look right, so I made the colons blue. Perhaps the stars are invisible, or if the stars are blue, perhaps it's the [48 star flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States#cite_ref-66) in use from 1912 until 1959, when Alaska joined the union.  :)

2022-07-09T03:34:14Z	(#inxcp3q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> No worries. Have a good night, man.
2022-07-09T06:49:47Z	Great chat tonight with @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt>. Some things we talked about: * @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt>'s new Craigslist pickups * Kubernetes woes * The SourceHut-Go-Google-DDoS situation ([blog post](https://drewdevault.com/2022/05/25/Google-has-been-DDoSing-sourcehut.html)) * @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>'s GoNix project ([#cy4gccq](/conv/cy4gccq/)) ([#spaxqka](/conv/spaxqka)) ([#eqxx4nq](/conv/eqxx4nq)) * @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt>'s in-car computer system * DNS level ad/tracker blocking * Corporate computer "security" policies * Adding a captcha to the registration form of Yarn pods (issue [#962](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/962)) ([#vqxz62q](/conv/vqxz62q))
2022-07-12T06:17:10Z	(#o4nnsma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I checked it out too and had the exact same thought.
2022-07-14T03:09:44Z	(#aip2mnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It is absolutely not just you. I found a nice video of someone going through Microsoft's efforts to make you use Edge on Windows 11. Is it okay if I upload it to tube.mills.io? It's 93.8 MiB.
2022-07-14T03:15:42Z	(#7mis5va) @<novaburst https://twt.nfld.uk/user/novaburst/twtxt.txt> Wow, that's really cool!
2022-07-14T21:18:29Z	(#aip2mnq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Virtual desktops are standard since at least 10. I doubt it's ever used by 99% of Windows users. Taskbar window grouping is the default. PowerToys are still around, adding things like window tiling and a bulk file rename utility. I think some of the PowerToys features from 10 were made standard in 11.
2022-07-14T21:32:43Z	(#aip2mnq) @<screem https://twtxt.net/user/screem/twtxt.txt> Whether you like the design or not, the User eXperience, I think, has gotten even worse in comparison to 10. The trend of the industry (read: Windows, Mac OS, and default Ubuntu to an extent) is to make everything beyond opening the (default) Web browser more difficult.  Want to create a shortcut in Windows 11? It used to be right there in the Explorer right click menu. Now, it's only accessible in the old menu accessed from clicking an option in the new right click menu. What are you making shortcuts for, peasant? You're lucky they let you do advanced things like "making shortcuts" and "installing software from outside the walled garden" at all.
2022-07-14T21:39:00Z	(#aip2mnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I tried to use tube.mills.io to upload that video, but I kept getting an error:  ```error transcoding video: cmd.CombinedOutput error: signal: killed```  I uploaded it to a regular file host instead. [Windows 11 in a Nutshell](https://files.catbox.moe/jufrov.mp4) [93.8 MiB]
2022-07-14T22:14:53Z	(#aip2mnq) I realized that the original video is H.264, here's an H.265 version. Same dimensions, comparable quality, but a third of the size! Oh, the joys of modern technology. :)  [Windows 11 in a Nutshell (H.265)](https://files.catbox.moe/brhtyx.mp4) [33.1 MiB]
2022-07-14T23:58:06Z	(#ifqscsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Does the H.264 version work at least?
2022-07-15T00:13:52Z	(#uhoffaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hm. Audio doesn't work for me either when I play the H.265 version in a browser. The file host didn't tamper with the file, and it works fine when I play it in MPV. It turns out it's not an Apple thing like I expected. [Neither Duopoly browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video#Browser_support) support H.265 (HEVC) playback but Safari should. As far as I can tell it ought to work on your iPhone, but it doesn't.  Anyway, 2004 called. They want their video compression standard back.
2022-07-15T00:15:24Z	(#tp7we5q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> No worries. I like Tube a lot. I've uploaded a couple of smaller videos in the past and it worked great the other times.
2022-07-15T03:42:46Z	(#uhoffaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well, it's H.265 was introduced in 2013. The real problem is that it's a proprietary standard but there are free software implementations of both the decoder and the encoder. The browser vendors just don't want to get sued. I didn't know that before today.
2022-07-15T05:01:11Z	(#ifqscsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Original H.264 version [here](https://files.catbox.moe/jufrov.mp4).  For the sake of experimentation, I made another one using vp9 for video and Opus for audio. It's at 480p instead of 720p like the others. It works fine on Firefox and Chromium based browsers on my Linux machine. Does it work on your phone? [480p vp9/Opus version](https://files.catbox.moe/ut9cjq.webm) [36.4 MiB]
2022-07-15T05:30:17Z	(#ifqscsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well, they *do* force you to use Safari on iOS. WebKit, at least. They just let people create their own UIs on top of it. They only have the ability to enforce something like that because you're only allowed to use software that Apple says you can use. Microsoft has the same level of control with S Mode on Windows, and it is disgusting and anti-user across the board.  With S Mode, at least you can get out of it (or at least you could on 10) by signing into a Microsoft account and clicking "yes" on some very scary looking dialog boxes. They hold your freedom hostage, and your personal information is the ransom. Of course, you can always re-install your OS. As far as I know, the embedded license key on S Mode machines activate regular Home editions of Windows. They did on 10. I'm sure they'll put a stop to that soon enough. They're already trying to stop people setting up their computers without a Microsoft account in the first place.
2022-07-15T07:14:45Z	(#ifqscsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> No, Web browsers in the Play Store can use any browser engine. [Firefox for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox) even supports extensions. It's not as big of a deal, anyway, because Android lets you run software from sources other than the Play Store.
2022-07-16T02:00:59Z	(#o4nnsma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I made an account and I'm waiting for a verification email. I'll make a thread on the [forum](https://forum.status.cafe/) once my account is activated and ask about twtxt integration.

The old menu was more functional because everything you needed was right there.  > ...easier to navigate...  It's much harder to navigate because the things you use most often are now relegated to tiny icons with no labels so you have to guess which one will do what you want.  What's more, the icons are all the same 2 or 3 colors. Remembering "the box and the line with the cursor on it is rename" is much more difficult to remember than "the one that says 'Rename' is rename" or even "the blue one is rename".  If I remember correctly, you can't even go off of position in the list because only the options that are applicable will show up. For example, if you don't have anything on the clipboard, the paste button isn't grayed out, it's just gone.
2022-07-19T02:56:52Z	(#2o73x6q) @<screem https://twtxt.net/user/screem/twtxt.txt>  > ...I don’t agree with the narrative of Microsoft trying to make things harder to do to keep you in their ecosystem...  Microsoft is leveraging their position as the vendor of your operating system to manipulate you into using their Web browser. I hope they pay dearly for this, but I doubt they will.  I shared a video I found that goes through this, and I had a little bit too much fun with ffmpeg so it's available in three formats. * [Original 720p H.264/AAC](https://files.catbox.moe/jufrov.mp4) [93.8 MiB]  * [720p H.265/AAC](https://files.catbox.moe/brhtyx.mp4) [33.1 MiB]  * [480p VP9/Opus](https://files.catbox.moe/ut9cjq.webm) [36.4 MiB]

Most of the visual problems in that screenshot are just SVG and custom font issues, and Ladybird definitely has some font things going on that aren't present in SerenityOS.  Really, this is an unfair test because of `yarnd`'s [markup issues](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ftwtxt.net%2F).

2022-07-24T20:16:32Z	(#52de2qq) I found an example of this the other day and posted it on my other feed. I was reading a blog post (that I found on HN) and at the bottom of the post there was a "Submit to HN" button. That shows you the real reason why the author wrote the post.  That's different than a button to share something to a microblog.
2022-07-24T20:32:59Z	(#eeg6tja) @<carsten http://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> They probably aggressively compress your images, so tread carefully if you care about that kind of thing.

2022-07-25T18:54:01Z	(#egqn5aq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I've never heard it put like that, and it makes sense. I don't *think* I vocalize most of the time, but I definitely do it when I'm reading something complicated and I really want to *understand* it.
2022-07-26T01:14:49Z	(#hkjnx7a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Ah, makes sense. I'm doing some heavy compiling right now and I wish I had a little more power myself.

2022-08-01T06:33:20Z	(#a4xsfbq) I couldn't get the screen to stop freezing. I even swallowed my pride and went to Super Weenie Hut Jr's to sip a sundae while I emerged sys-kernel/gentoo-kernel-bin. To my delight, it didn't work with that kernel either. GRUB is my new prime suspect. ![Image of Super Weenie Hut Jr's](https://twtxt.net/media/VjWVDe3N73Q2XqcoWH59Z8.png)
2022-08-03T08:19:33Z	(#a4xsfbq) I ditched the Super Weenie Hut Jr. kernel and went back to a manually compiled one. Screwed around with GRUB, no luck. `dmesg` suggests the problem occurs when Nouveau takes over the framebuffer console. I'll ask about it on the Gentoo forum next time I have a few hours to spend on this.

I can't pass up an opportunity to use ffmpeg, so here's a yuv420p version that Firefox will play: [360p H.264 yuv420p](https://files.catbox.moe/a9jpin.mp4) [11.1 MiB]
2022-08-04T22:09:59Z	(#4pfl45a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I reached out to Wesleyac of thoughts.page via e-mail and made a post on the forum of status.cafe. I haven't gotten a response on either.
2022-08-06T01:45:10Z	(#2dp3c7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'll be there. I've missed it the past couple of weeks.
2022-08-06T06:24:25Z	Great meeting after a two week break with @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt>, and retrocrash who has (hopefully temporarily) disappeared from Yarnspace. A small sampling of what we talked about: * "Easy self-hosting" platforms and why most of them are terrible * @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> opening up [GoNix](https://git.mills.io/prologic/gonix) * RSS in 2022 * Sending an SMS message over e-mail * Swap space * TempleOS

2022-08-06T08:04:08Z	Compiling LLVM. It just doesn't end.
2022-08-07T19:13:55Z	(#4xxgkfq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Yeah, that sounds about right. I turned on access logging for a week about a year ago. I never did the math, but it was pretty much just me and a collection of robots.
2022-08-07T20:02:30Z	(#gqqqwca) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic> I would be fine bumping it back an hour, but 6 am is a bit early for our German friends.

Perhaps there was an \@stigatle\@twtxt.net at one point and the `yarnd` auto-expand is confused. I always add the correct domain to my posts to avoid this.
2022-08-07T20:08:09Z	(#jf2zkia) That's weird. I put the twtxt.net domain on the second mention of @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> and `yarnd` changed it (correctly) to yarn.stigatle.no. I edited the message and escaped the @<s https://twtxt.net/user/s/twtxt.txt>.
2022-08-07T20:08:36Z	(#jf2zkia) And of course there's a user named \@s.

I threw together a shell script that generates HTML time zone tables. https://mckinley.cc/time.html  Am I missing any time zones of video call regulars? Is 07:00:00-23:00:00 a reasonable window?
2022-08-08T03:31:39Z	(#gqqqwca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Midnight for you is okay? Maybe if I got up that early on Saturday for the meeting I would actually go find some garage sales like I always mean to do.  Also, check out the hash of the parent twt. Quads!
2022-08-08T04:34:38Z	(#gqqqwca) > Also, check out the hash of the parent twt. Quads!  Never mind, I just realized it's `gqqq`, not `qqqq`
2022-08-09T00:48:13Z	(#gqqqwca) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Thanks! I just changed "Germany" to "Central Europe" and fixed the UK's time zone.
2022-08-09T01:02:18Z	(#4xxgkfq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> A week was only a few kilobytes of logs for me, so I just used `grep` and a text editor. @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> wrote a suite of command line tools for analyzing different web server log formats if you're interested: [fl](https://adi.tilde.institute/fl/), [cl](https://adi.tilde.institute/cl/), and [cbl](https://adi.tilde.institute/cbl/)

2022-08-09T21:11:38Z	(#xd2alqa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I think audio compression techniques have come further than production. This sounds pretty darn good for 128kbps.

2022-08-10T05:41:09Z	This is a weird request, but does anyone have something for me to encode with FFmpeg? The more complicated the project, the better. I am trying to improve my skills and I learn best with real-world use.
2022-08-10T06:49:46Z	(#godwcaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> There isn't a whole lot I could do with those, besides trying to beat your server's transcodes in visual quality for the size. It wouldn't be much of an accomplishment, anyway, because I'm sure you don't want your server's CPU tied up for 20 minutes every upload.  I could always use practice optimizing for quality given a set of restraints but I would like a bigger project that requires combining a bunch of options and filters.

2022-08-11T22:08:46Z	(#bqxlviq) We've barreled past the microblog line and flew straight over the e-mail chain line. This is just social blogging.

2022-08-11T22:15:38Z	(#wf37oda) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I've never tried Caddy. Nginx does what I need it to do, most of the time. I also use [darkhttpd](https://unix4lyfe.org/darkhttpd/) for testing.
2022-08-11T22:20:17Z	(#godwcaa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I used to be intimidated by FFmpeg, but since I've been digging deeper into the options I'm having a lot of fun.
2022-08-13T03:33:17Z	(#gqqqwca) Are we doing the meeting this week? I think we're all individually being too flexible and so we can't come up with a time.  (Paging @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> because nobody wants to come to the meeting if he isn't there)
2022-08-13T03:55:41Z	(#gqqqwca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'll definitely be there. Same bat-time, same bat-Jitsi-room?
2022-08-13T06:16:22Z	(#qmlkmia) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Oh wow, that's really cool. Is that an A340?
2022-08-13T06:41:21Z	Another great chat this week with @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic>. Some things we talked about: * Porting Syslinux to Go for GoNix * My shell script that generates an [HTML time zone conversion table](https://mckinley.cc/time.html) using information from a simple CSV file * The ubiquity of `seq` despite not being part of POSIX * Spam prevention on Yarn pods * [Subreply](https://subreply.com/), another alternative microblogging service
2022-08-13T18:55:04Z	(#moqdvoq) @<lyse http://lyse.isobeef.org> Would [Claws Mail](https://www.claws-mail.org/) fit your needs? It's been my mail client of choice since I switched from Thunderbird.
2022-08-13T18:59:05Z	(#kglknja) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Hey, it's good to see you. How are things?
2022-08-14T00:19:29Z	(#nekd5sq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thanks, man. Sorry I missed it before.  > Why is Facebook so successful?  > There are many reasons for Facebook's success, but one of the main reasons is that it is a platform that allows users to connect with friends and family members easily. Facebook also allows users to share photos, videos, and other content easily.
2022-08-14T00:28:02Z	(#nekd5sq) > What computer does Richard Stallman use?  > Richard Stallman uses a laptop with the GNU/Linux operating system.  Close enough.
2022-08-14T05:19:41Z	(#moqdvoq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> It looks the [AttachWarner](https://www.claws-mail.org/plugin.php?plugin=attachwarner) plugin does just that. I'm going to enable it myself. Sounds handy.
2022-08-14T05:34:18Z	(#nekd5sq) > Is TikTok influenced by the Chinese Communist Party?  > There is no evidence that TikTok is influenced by the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok is a social media platform that is popular with users in China, but it is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance.  BS! At least it didn't try to parrot the ByteDance deflection line ["TikTok isn't even available in China"](https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-master-messaging-pr-playbook-china-music-1849334736) which is false because TikTok is available in China, they just call it Douyin instead.

That could definitely work, it just seems pretty formal. @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt>, what do you mean "doodle"?
2022-08-16T05:44:55Z	(#tbdkceq) @<yarn_police https://twtxt.net/user/yarn_police/twtxt.txt> Hold on a minute, txt.sour.is is out of your jurisdiction!

2022-08-19T19:21:02Z	(#cpppxfa) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> I don't understand. What is the time zone? If UTC, why isn't it converting it to my time zone with some of the garbage it's downloading in the background? If it's my time zone, why isn't it telling me that?  I'm available this evening my time (Saturday 04:00-06:00 UTC) and tomorrow in the morning (Saturday 16:00-18:00 UTC) and the evening (Sunday 02:00-06:00 UTC).

2022-08-20T06:51:48Z	(#t3akw7a) @<tel https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/tel/twtxt.txt> Man, Revolt is getting to be a big deal, huh? I was part of the closed beta as a friend of a friend of the lead dev. I am part of the reason it uses the AGPL license. I stopped using it because of social media addiction, but I feel like I'm hearing about it every week now. It's definitely a lot better than Discord.  To me, the Mumble/XMPP combination is superior because of the lack of complexity in comparison to an all-in-one App™ that combines text, voice, and a Web interface. Perhaps some of this has changed in the past year or so, but Mumble's sound quality and latency is unmatched, and XMPP has end-to-end encryption and federation, two important features that Revolt doesn't have. I have never used Fosscord, so I don't know if it has either of them.
2022-08-20T06:52:49Z	(#5dfn7pq)  @<lyse-backup https://twtxt.net/user/lyse-backup/twtxt.txt> Welcome to the pod everyone uses on the Totally Not Centralized Yarn.social!
2022-08-20T07:54:55Z	(#5dfn7pq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm contributing to the soft centralization myself, but choice is everything. As long as you can be part of the network with nothing but a text editor and some Web space (which I prove is possible with @<mckinley https://mckinley.cc/twtxt.txt>), I don't think it's so bad that one pod has so many users.
2022-08-21T06:00:33Z	Who mentioned [Photon](https://sr.ht/~ghost08/photon/) in the call last night? Was it @<tel https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/tel/twtxt.txt>?

What's wrong with just having a weekly thread on Yarn where we announce our availability and come to a consensus on the time?

2022-08-26T06:42:19Z	(#2ciawva) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> I think you mean [Power-line communication](gopher://gopherpedia.com/0/Power-line%20communication). We're talking about transmitting IP datagrams by printing them out and taping them to the feet of homing pigeons.

2022-08-26T07:28:33Z	(#jc4lrpq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The only thing it has going for it is ubiquity.

2022-08-27T06:23:19Z	Very enjoyable hour-long [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/) ad segment this week with @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> and @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic>. ;)  Some things we talked about:  * Insights on having children * .NET development * Features and approaches of different self-hosting platforms * The future of GoNix * Making a self-hosting platform "just work"
2022-08-28T03:41:04Z	(#syipe3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> This is my only problem with Go, but it applies to just about every "modern" language. Language-specific package managers make it too easy to introduce another dependency to your project.  This eventually gets to a point where you get [is-even](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even), with 207,899 weekly downloads, the full source code of which is pasted below.  ``` 'use strict';  var isOdd = require('is-odd');  module.exports = function isEven(i) {   return !isOdd(i); }; ```  [is-odd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd) gets 439,933 weekly downloads, and depends on [is-number](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-number) which gets a staggering 68,678,128 downloads per week. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to go read the source code of those. Don't worry, it's not a big time commitment.
2022-08-28T20:17:57Z	Could someone do me a favor and send a bug report in to [Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea)? I made an account on GitHub for the purpose but they "flagged" my account, whatever that means, and then my support request about it went to /dev/null. I made the bug report, but it isn't visible unless you're logged in to my account.  It would be awfully nice if they would eat their own dog food, because I've never had a problem signing up to a Gitea instance. I uploaded my bug report [here](https://clbin.com/yVj6r). They have a form system, so you'll have to copy and paste the text into the fields. I didn't fill in any of the fields that aren't listed.

2022-09-02T20:13:55Z	(#aagwhgq) @<akoizumi https://social.kyoko-project.wer.ee/user/akoizumi/twtxt.txt> I see.
2022-09-03T03:27:11Z	(#miamuaa) @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> I'm up to chat for a bit. I don't think @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> is around, though.
2022-09-03T04:03:37Z	(#miamuaa) @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> I'm totally fine if we just do it next week. I know it's not very entertaining to be the only one using a microphone.
2022-09-03T05:56:49Z	Nice little chat tonight with @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt>. @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> was very selfishly out having fun with his family instead of talking to us internet strangers. Happy birthday, man!  Some things we talked about: * Video games * Video games *on Linux* * Microsoft Active Directory * Microsoft ClearType * Windows' 30 year old spaghetti code leading to dialog boxes like [this](https://rimgo.bus-hit.me/hUDWtUN.jpg)
2022-09-03T05:59:40Z	(#wtfnszq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It looks like `yarnd` ate that twt. It's definitely on the [original feed](https://maya.land/assets/twtxt.txt), but not on the [external user page](https://twtxt.net/external?uri=https://maya.land/assets/twtxt.txt&nick=maya).
2022-09-03T06:00:39Z	(#wtfnszq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hmm, it's not on [twt.nfld.uk's external user page](https://twt.nfld.uk/external?uri=https://maya.land/assets/twtxt.txt&nick=maya) either.
2022-09-03T06:34:05Z	(#wtfnszq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's definitely a good thing that malicious actors can't just make a post in the future and effectively be "pinned" on every Yarn pod. I'm glad that was fixed.
2022-09-03T18:37:57Z	(#wtfnszq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt> @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I went on the [mastodon feed](https://occult.institute/@maya) and it seems the twtxt posts have been ahead by an hour since at least July 1st. It's possible the bug was never fixed but we didn't notice until someone with a different client tried to respond to @<maya https://maya.land/assets/twtxt.txt>.
2022-09-03T21:25:57Z	(#wtfnszq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> It's alright, [time zones are challenging to work with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY) :)
2022-09-04T03:06:58Z	(#wtfnszq) @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt> You can use it in twtxt files. From the [original spec](https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/twtxtfile.html#format-specification) (emphasis mine):  > The twtxt file contains one status per line, each of which is equipped with an RFC 3339 date-time string (**with or without UTC offset**) followed by a TAB character (\t) to separate it from the actual text. A specific ordering of the statuses is not mandatory.  Actually, feeds generated by `yarnd` are on UTC, using the [zulu suffix](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#section-2)

2022-09-13T20:01:24Z	(#ea5qacq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org> I think we've talked about this before, but my front-end for every video host is [MPV](https://mpv.io/)+yt-dlp with some [MPV userscripts](https://mckinley.cc/blog/20220506.html#mpv-youtube-quality) to improve the experience, called by Newsboat and my Web browser using [ff2mpv](https://github.com/woodruffw/ff2mpv).  Lately, I've been thinking about a wrapper script for MPV that tries to find a copy of the video on disk before it lets MPV use yt-dlp to stream it. This would be used in conjunction with another program that grabs a list of articles in Newsboat with a specific [tag](https://newsboat.org/releases/2.28/docs/newsboat.html#_tagging) to filter videos from non-videos.  Videos marked unread are queued for download with yt-dlp if there isn't already a local copy. Videos marked read are deleted if there is a local copy. I think this could be done by interacting with Newsboat's database directly, but that isn't preferable.  How does ybeuter work? Is the source available?

2022-09-16T04:38:55Z	Recent updates to LibWeb have fixed the icons on the Yarn web client in Ladybird and the SerenityOS browser! Unfortunately, it still isn't possible to post using LibWeb browsers but we'll get there. :^)  ![twtxt.net's Discover page viewed in Ladybird on 2022-09-15](https://mckinley.cc/img/ladybird-yarn-20220915.png)  For comparison, here's a screenshot from 2022-07-22: ![twtxt.net's Discover page viewed in Ladybird on 2022-07-22](https://mckinley.cc/img/ladybird-yarn-20220722.png)
2022-09-16T06:02:59Z	(#y3bp7ga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It seems that LibWeb doesn't support textarea elements properly. You can select the textarea, but you can't type in it. The "Post" button works when JavaScript is disabled, but there's nothing in the textarea to post.

2022-09-17T06:16:29Z	A very insightful chat tonight with @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic>, @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt>, @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt>, and @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt>'s friend Ian who is, presumably, still primarily using legacy social networks. Hopefully we can change that. Some things we talked about tonight:  * The rationale behind GoNix * @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt>'s thoughts on social networking (https://blog.neotxt.dk/) * Bringing people on to free platforms * Bot prevention on Yarn.social ([#981](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/pulls/981)) * Funding for Yarn.social * Goryon, material design, and satanism
2022-09-17T06:35:49Z	(#hpadmla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I watched that last night, it's definitely one of my new favorite talks. Right up there with [That Awesome Time I Was Sued For Two Billion Dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSWqx8goqSY). My favorite part was the Ruby `unless` statement.
2022-09-17T07:05:47Z	(#qjbfs6q) @<movq https://uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic> It's Group Policy on a blockchain.
2022-09-17T07:51:21Z	(#gymnniq) @<lyse http://lyse.isobeef.org> I figured it was a milk vending machine, but I'd never heard of such a thing. Interesting. That's better than Canadian bagged milk.
2022-09-17T19:28:20Z	(#nsijvza) "Bot prevention" was a poor choice of words. I meant "Unwanted bot prevention." A GPT-3 bot would be interesting @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>. Just watch out for [prompt injection](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/).
2022-09-17T21:56:59Z	(#nsijvza) This thread has some hilarious examples of prompt injection: https://nitter.1d4.us/simonw/status/1569451817897193473
2022-09-18T00:01:49Z	(#mb2mkva) Completely off topic: I was hoping to make a redirect rule for Scrolller to Libreddit, but it seems their post IDs are just random.  I did find that the original path on Reddit is in the page inside a stringified JSON object as a global variable defined in a `script` element. `JSON.parse(window.scrolllerConfig).item.redditPath` will return the path.  I suppose this could be done with a userscript, but the whole point is to not load the Scrolller page. Interestingly, the first one you posted has been deleted from Reddit.
2022-09-18T06:17:43Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, they're spreading. https://git.mills.io/Jeansonhacks/Jeansonhacks007
2022-09-18T07:42:48Z	(#kjsrlnq) I wonder, what's stopping users from not following the twt hash spec and prepending a Git commit hash to every new post? AFAIK yarnd will display the oldest post it has for a hash as the root, but it assumes that it's a reply to another post with that hash and that people replying should add to that chain. I'm not advocating for breaking the spec, but how do other clients handle this?
2022-09-18T08:17:32Z	(foo bar baz) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> But it doesn't give us a /conv/ page because 'foo bar baz' is obviously an invalid hash. Let me try something.
2022-09-18T08:23:45Z	(#kjsrlnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I must be mistaken. I thought, when we realized @<maya https://maya.land/assets/twtxt.txt> was still posting in the future, that there was an entire thread (with a /conv/ page) and the hash didn't resolve to anything until the timestamp of the parent twt. Perhaps yarnd gave it a /conv/ page because it knew about the twt but didn't display it because it was in the future. Perhaps I need to go to bed.
2022-09-19T01:12:33Z	(#cadv5ka) @<akoizumi https://social.kyoko-project.wer.ee/user/akoizumi/twtxt.txt> I have a similar rule. I will install a Python program if it's polished enough (e.g. yt-dlp) but Node.js is a hard pass.
2022-09-20T02:23:36Z	(#al2rgeq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Looks great. What would the 1st and 2nd themes look like if the icons were the color of the text? Or the accent color like the 4th theme?
2022-09-20T05:49:35Z	(#al2rgeq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> I'm talking about the gray color for the Tabler icons in the first two themes, i.e. the rich text buttons. I was wondering what they would look like if they used the theme's accent color or the text color. Now that I think of it, the text color wouldn't look right either.  The third theme (black/yellow) uses the accent color for those buttons. I was using that as an example.
2022-09-20T19:10:11Z	(#coyqx5a) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> Why is that?
2022-09-20T19:13:54Z	(#al2rgeq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> That's exactly what I was thinking, it looks really nice. I can't decide if I like the dark/blue or the dark/yellow theme better.
2022-09-21T05:14:36Z	(#nsijvza) @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> I don't know, I'm still waiting for the paperwork on that.

2022-09-22T20:42:03Z	(#eo2akba) @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> :)
2022-09-23T00:38:14Z	(#p2vnraq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It would definitely be interesting. I don't think there could be any substantial code reuse but I'm open to the idea. I looked into doing it, but there are a few hangups that would probably need to be addressed first: * Something in the pipeline is adding U+FFFD Replacement Characters to the ends of certain twts * Markdown isn't rendered to HTML in the Atom feed, but mentions are. * `<summary>` elements (which should probably be `<contents>` instead) are `type="html"`, escaped HTML. It wouldn't be possible to embed twt contents in the generated page on Firefox-based browsers due to my favorite [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98168) 	* The other options are either plain text or inline XHTML which means you have to make sure every twt is valid XHTML. * I don't know how to handle different themes short of JavaScript which can be buggy when used with client-side XSLT or dynamically generated XSLT which is completely and utterly ridiculous.
2022-09-23T00:41:25Z	(#p2vnraq) These aren't things I could fix myself, and in my opinion some of them wouldn't be worth it if I could.
2022-09-23T00:50:27Z	(#jjmdxra) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I didn't really want to announce it until I expanded it some more, but I started a [list of twtxt-related things](https://git.mills.io/mckinley/groovy-twtxt) over on Gitea. Perhaps it could be relevant here?
2022-09-23T02:04:07Z	(#p2vnraq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The first two, definitely. Do you want me to open a couple issues?

2022-09-23T20:39:10Z	(#peh3rea) You know, I thought you had to use a Duopoly browser if you wanted client-side XSLT but I just learned WebKit supports it as well! That means it works on Otter Browser and WebPositive. Safari too, probably, but we don't talk about that one.
2022-09-23T22:48:29Z	(#peh3rea) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> That's the surprise. Take a look at `view-source:https://mckinley.cc/blog/atom.xml`

2022-09-24T02:38:41Z	(#kqs5t5a) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> I'd like to add pixelblog to [groovy-twtxt](https://git.mills.io/mckinley/groovy-twtxt) but I would rather not include software without a formal license.

2022-09-24T06:16:21Z	A nice chat tonight with @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic>, @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt>, and @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt>. Some things we talked about: * Markdown isn't rendered to HTML in Atom feeds ([#989](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/989)) * A look at @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt>'s [branch](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/src/branch/theme_simpleCSS) to replace Pico.css with Simple.css * 100 monthly active users on yarn.social * Sandstorm proxy authentication for yarnd (Allows one set of credentials across programs hosted on Sandstorm) * Sandstorm support for Tube ([#26](https://git.mills.io/prologic/tube/pulls/26)) * Future improvements to Sandstorm
2022-09-24T06:18:00Z	(#uft3kdq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I use it in some of my blog posts for `inline code snippets` so they don't get wrapped where it would make it hard to read. Other places, too, but I can't remember right now.
2022-09-24T07:21:52Z	(#y3bp7ga) LibWeb font handling has greatly improved. We're no longer stuck with that terrible bitmap font. It looks like there are still a few font-related issues to iron out, but here is what the Yarn discover page looks like on Ladybird. A huge improvement in only a week, though it really can't decide where it should put that search box. ![twtxt.net's Discover page viewed in Ladybird on 2022-09-24](https://mckinley.cc/img/ladybird-yarn-20220924.png)
2022-09-24T19:28:48Z	(#wdu6cca) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> I think twtxt is a fine feed format, especially if you're allergic to XML.
2022-09-24T19:30:50Z	(#gsewnyq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> This is really interesting stuff. Do you plan on sharing the code, or at least a more detailed write-up of your process?
2022-09-24T22:14:20Z	(#rbkm6dq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> > Twtxt is plaintext, but lots of folks (me included) actually use markdown in their yarns. However, the actual format being used is not advertised anywhere.  That's a really good point. We should formalize a Markdown flavor as a format extension on https://dev.twtxt.net/.  yarnd appears to use [gomarkdown](https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown) with a few [extensions](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/src/branch/main/internal/utils.go#L2189). I'm not sure what else gomarkdown translates by default.  There should definitely be a concrete specification on what syntax should be supported by twtxt clients with "Markdown" support. cc @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt>
2022-09-24T22:32:50Z	(#wdu6cca) > For a real feed format I would like to have a clear separation between titles and content. And more options for the content. Plaintext and HTML at least.  I don't think it's a very good idea to include content when using twtxt as a syndication format. Anything based on twtxt, in my opinion, should retain the spirit of the original specification, especially readability by humans and machines. 10K of HTML in one line absolutely breaks human readability.  What about `TIMESTAMP\tTITLE\tPERMALINK`, like the following?  ``` 2022-09-22T14:53:26-07:00	Bringing Back a Useful Browser Feature With a Bookmarklet	https://mckinley.cc/blog/20220922.html ```
2022-09-24T23:13:56Z	(#wdu6cca) @<akoizumi https://social.kyoko-project.wer.ee/user/akoizumi/twtxt.txt> It looks like [that feed](https://codemadness.org/twtxt.txt) uses `TIMESTAMP\tTITLE: PERMALINK` which would be harder to parse programmatically.  This discussion has me thinking of a serious syndication format built on top of twtxt that could be implemented in normal feed readers. It would be limited, but extremely easy for a Webmaster to implement. Users could also receive updates with a normal twtxt client. I think there could be some utility in it.
2022-09-25T00:22:18Z	(#y3bp7ga) Of course I pick the day before simple.css gets merged into main to get a new Ladybird screenshot. Here's one post-merge. ![twtxt.net's Discover page viewed in Ladybird, post-merge, on 2022-09-24](https://mckinley.cc/img/ladybird-yarn-20220924-2.png)
2022-09-25T00:34:12Z	(#rbkm6dq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't know if a metadata field is strictly necessary. I think there ought to be a defined set of syntax that all clients with Markdown support can be expected to handle in the same way. [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/) maybe? It looks like Yarn supports most of CommonMark already, though I've never seen a horizontal rule. Let's try it: *** Some text here ---
2022-09-25T00:36:00Z	(#zogehjq) Nope, no horizontal rule. What about referenced links?  [My website][1] ![An image on my website][2]  [1]: https://mckinley.cc/ [2]: https://mckinley.cc/img/ladybird-yarn-20220924-2.png
2022-09-25T00:44:19Z	(#xvx7mta) @<akoizumi https://social.kyoko-project.wer.ee/user/akoizumi/twtxt.txt> That looks fun. I'd play if we could get some more people in the game.
2022-09-25T00:47:06Z	(#xvx7mta) I think I broke it, though, because I started a game alone and then accidentally pressed ctrl+c. When I try to log back in, it says there's a game in progress and I can't start a new one. Sorry about that...
2022-09-25T01:06:08Z	(#zogehjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Referenced links also work on the Web client, but I tried both CommonMark syntax options for the horizontal rule and only one worked on Goryon.  This is exactly what I'm talking about. We should have a concrete specification so Markdown can be rendered consistently between client implementations.

2022-09-25T20:55:24Z	(#ybjlgha) I'm sorry, I didn't explain this properly and that has led to a misunderstanding of my actual proposal. I was not intending for the title to be a special field unless the client explicitly understood my syndication format.  The original [twtxt format specification](https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/twtxtfile.html) gives no special meaning to the tab character, excluding the one that separates the timestamp from the text. I was under the impression that the tab character could appear in a twt so it would be interpreted as follows, replacing ␉ with a tab character.  ``` 2022-09-22T14:53:26-07:00␉Bringing Back a Useful Browser Feature With a Bookmarklet␉https://mckinley.cc/blog/20220922.html #^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ #|                        | # ```- Timestamp             `- Message ```  Although, I just remembered that the tab character is technically a control code, so it shouldn't be allowed.
2022-09-26T20:34:05Z	(#ybjlgha) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> The specification just says:  > Also note that a status may not contain any control characters.  Which is extremely vague, but U+0009 Horizontal Tabulation *is* in the [C0 control code block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#HT)  I'm sure 99% of twtxt parsers don't treat additional tabs any differently. Even Buckket's [reference implementation](https://github.com/buckket/twtxt/blob/master/twtxt/parser.py#L74) [includes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) additional tabs in the message. Although, in fairness, it doesn't check for *any* for control codes.  Maybe we need a less ambiguous specification documenting how twtxt feeds are being written in the wild. Did you know that the comment convention is not a part of the original spec? I feel like it's used everywhere, [even](http://grex.org/~tfurrows/twtxt.txt) [among](https://pestilenz.org/~ckeen/twtxt.txt) [feeds](https://super.seekrit.club/twtxt.txt) that don't use any Yarn extensions.
2022-09-27T06:47:05Z	(#vfxgqmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's proof of stake, so you need to stake 15,000 units of their cryptocurrency $OXEN, worth $3118 US, to run a "full service node" and 3750 $OXEN ($779 US) to run a "shared node". If I understand correctly, only "full service nodes" can route Session messages.  If you don't have enough $OXEN, you can pool what you do have with other people and run a node that way.  TL;DR: Not very easy. To help route Session messages at all, you have to buy in to their cryptocurrency.  Sources: * https://loki.network/service-nodes/ * https://imaginary.stream/sn/
2022-09-27T07:49:45Z	(#zdoe7hq) @<screem https://twtxt.net/user/screem/twtxt.txt> It is not a tough dilemma for me. A government has no right to perform mass surveillance on its citizens, treating everyone as if they were criminals. It starts with something we can all agree is reprehensible, and they say it stops there, but history tells us it never just *stops there*.  In addition, computers are really bad at their jobs. How many innocent people will be punished with a false positive? How many mothers will be punished for sending a photo of their newborn to the doctor?  I'm talking about punishment not only in the legal sense, but with the time, money, and worry associated with fighting legal punishment. Do you even trust your legal system enough that it will protect innocent people in these circumstances from having their lives ruined?  There are questions to be raised about the effectiveness of such a policy for its intended purpose but I'm running out of characters.  https://puri.sm/posts/internet-of-snitches/
2022-09-27T08:43:35Z	(#vfxgqmq) @<screem https://twtxt.net/user/screem/twtxt.txt> I think there is value in cryptocurrencies as long as they have sufficient privacy protections. If you have someone's Bitcoin or Ethereum address, you can see every transaction he's ever been involved in. Not enough people know that.  The value is in being able to send a scarce resource to anyone on the planet, any time of the day, any day of the week, and have it received in 20 minutes. As long as privacy is preserved, I think it's great.  It's completely useless in the context of a chat service, though. The blockchain nonsense was part of the reason why I ditched Session, but it was mostly the Electron client.

2022-09-29T08:40:05Z	(#j5l4mla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Markdown horizontal rules never worked on the Web client, as far as I know.  @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt>, I think that specific line had a use as a visual separator between the non-interactive text and the interactive buttons, but it's not a hill I'm willing to die on.
2022-09-29T08:41:10Z	I just typed out a message here on Yarn, undid a few things with ctrl+z, and then tried to redo something with the vi redo key combination. That means it's time to go to bed.
2022-09-30T22:43:15Z	(#wql4w5q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't think the solution proposed there is a good one, and here are my reasons.  1. The specification says quite clearly, "The file must be encoded with UTF-8". If an old piece of software can't handle UTF-8, it can't produce a valid twtxt feed at all.  2. I believe the intention behind this solution is to make it render in an acceptable fashion in clients that don't support the convention, but I think it's the opposite in reality. Separating posts like that could make it very frustrating to read in a feed. I would much rather have nothing or a replacement character separating logical lines.  3. I think it interferes quite heavily with human readability for the same reason. When reading a twtxt feed, it's helpful to know that each line with a timestamp represents one post.
2022-09-30T22:44:56Z	(#wql4w5q) It also says "A specific ordering of the statuses is not mandatory," implying that the order of the lines in the file is irrelevant. If newlines are separate posts with the same timestamp, the original line order becomes very relevant. I can see how a client (that doesn't support this newline syntax) might display posts with the same timestamp in the wrong order because of this.

2022-10-06T02:27:37Z	(#skbye2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> If a government bans the currency, it wouldn't have a hope of being enforced unless they could make all the internet service providers enforce a domain **whitelist**. Not a **blacklist** like the Great Firewall of China.  The GFW also does [deep packet inspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection), and perhaps that could be used (likely on a per-currency basis) to limit the access of nodes, but that can be circumvented with Tor bridges.  The government *could* cut off a country from the Internet like you said, but then you have bigger problems than your favorite internet currency being unusable. Even then, there would still be ways around it.

At least, that's how I understand it.

That doesn't happen on LibreWolf due to its security measures.  My real IP still didn't leak because my VPN client prevents any other program from using my real network interface.
2022-10-14T07:01:28Z	(#cpoievq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  > So it comes down to who you trust [more], your ISP or your VPN provider(s)?  My VPN provider, 100%. I've talked about my ISP in the past.  Besides, I don't *need* to trust them as much as my ISP. Under normal circumstances, this is the important information that your ISP can know about you:  * All of your personal information, down to a home address * The IP addresses to which you're connecting * Information leaked by unencrypted traffic (DNS queries, etc.)  As long as the VPN provider doesn't require any personal information, and mine doesn't, you're making it so no single party has all of that information. The IP address cloaking is an added benefit for me.  > You still leak your IP address with that TURN server however.  If your WebRTC implementation isn't broken, the TURN server sees your traffic as coming from the VPN server, just like any thing else you connect to through that tunnel. It's the same story if I open a port and make a direct p2p connection.
2022-10-14T07:03:56Z	(#f7pxu3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well, you can always run a Monero node as a Tor hidden service :)

2022-10-22T21:50:13Z	(#jv66uaa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> HTTPS-only mode in Firefox and derivatives will automatically try HTTPS, then give you the option to connect with HTTP if the server doesn't support TLS. I'm not sure about Chromium.  I generally like that system, but it can get annoying at times. I wish there was a way I could disable the dialog (while still trying https first for unknown domains) on a per-tab basis, letting it fall back to plain HTTP without user input.  On a somewhat related note, I recently discovered a cURL option to specify a default protocol when invoked without a scheme, e.g. `curl mckinley.cc`.  In `~/.config/curlrc`:  ``` proto-default = https `````

2022-10-24T09:48:54Z	(#7tfgmaq) @<cobra https://yn.vern.cc/user/cobra/twtxt.txt> I like [Geomyidae](gopher://bitreich.org/1/scm/geomyidae/), but it doesn't have per-user Gopherspace. [Gophernicus](https://github.com/gophernicus/gophernicus) does, along with a few other bells and whistles.
2022-10-24T19:30:58Z	(#7tfgmaq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's called "cgod" and it isn't written in C *or* Go? I want my money back...  I also like Gopher more than Gemini. The problem Gemini is trying to solve is better solved by just writing static HTML 4.01 pages.
2022-10-24T20:57:22Z	(#7tfgmaq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> Gopher is designed to be a simple way to access information on the Internet, as an alternative to the World Wide Web. No markup, just plain text and hyperlinks to resources.  Gemini is too simple in the wrong places, e.g. the very limited Markdown-lite. It's also too complicated in the wrong places, e.g. mandatory encryption.  Gopher's continued usage even after being "beaten" by the Web speaks volumes. I don't hate Gemini. Actually, I enjoy exploring Geminispace from time to time. I think it's a fad, though. People aren't going to use it in 30 years.  (Assertions like that, when it comes to technology, never come true. In 30 years, when Gemini takes over, feel free to come back to this twt and make fun of me. It won't be the first time an inferior protocol becomes dominant.)

2022-10-25T22:59:39Z	(#wwxq6mq) TLS is absolutely applicable to Gopher and people have [done it](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2019-03-07-gopher-server-tls.html), but there's no standard so everyone implements it differently. It's not widely implemented in clients or daemons.  Also, lots of people are against TLS because it's too hard to implement on your own; Gopher daemons would need to depend on an external library.  If you want Gopher encrypted, the best option is to make your Gopher daemon accessible as a Tor hidden service.
2022-10-26T06:10:33Z	Anyone know of a tool that will crawl a website, run JavaScript, and then save the resulting DOM as HTML?  I tried [Wpull](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/wpull), but I can't get it to stop crashing on startup and development seems to have stopped.  I'm sure there's a joke to be made about Python here.
2022-10-26T07:27:10Z	(#momapxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm trying to make a static local mirror of MDN Web Docs. It's all free information on GitHub, but the whole system is extremely complicated.  <​tinfoil-hat>I think it's so they can sell more MDN plus subscriptions, making people use their **terrible** [MDN Offline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/plus/docs/features/offline) system that uses the local storage of your browser.<​/tinfoil-hat>  At this point, I'm willing to run a local dev server and just save each generated page and its dependencies.  I really only need it to run JavaScript so it can request the browser compatibility JSON. It's https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data but the MDN server, annoyingly, transforms it.  Once the BCD is rendered statically, I should be able to remove the references to the JavaScript.  That will solve another issue I'm having where the JavaScript is constantly trying to download `/api/v1/whoami`, which seemingly has no purpose aside from user tracking.
2022-10-26T07:46:27Z	(#momapxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's close, but it's just a Web scraping library. I'm looking for something of the command line variety.
2022-10-26T07:52:00Z	(#fqekltq) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Wow, that's a great idea. I wonder if MDN could be used as a data source. The Markdown would need some significant transformation done. https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/html/element/span/index.md
2022-10-26T07:56:00Z	(#momapxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That's awfully nice of you, but you don't need to do that. I know you're a busy guy.  I'm sure I can find something if I look around some more. I can't be the only one that wants to make a static mirror of a dynamic website.
2022-10-26T08:15:59Z	(#momapxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What I need it to do is crawl a website, executing JavaScript along the way, and saving the resulting DOMs to HTML files. It isn't necessary to save the files downloaded via XHR and the like, but I would need it to save page requisites. CSS, JavaScript, favicons, etc.  Something that I'd like to have, but isn't required, is mirroring of content (+ page requisites) in frames. ([Example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span)) This would involve spanning hosts, but I only need to span hosts for this specific purpose.  It would also be nice if the program could resolve absolute paths to relative paths (`/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes` -> `../../Global_attributes`) but this isn't required either. I think I'm going to have to have a local Web server running anyway because just about all the links are to directories with an `index.html`. (i.e the actual file referenced by `/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes` is `/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/index.html`.)
2022-10-26T08:19:44Z	(#momapxa) Now I've just realized that if `/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes` is saved with that filename, the Web server is probably going to send the wrong MIME type. Wget solves this with [--adjust-extension](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#index-_002ehtml-extension).  Man, you really don't have to do this...
2022-10-26T08:45:50Z	(#momapxa) If I can get a proper static copy of MDN, I'll make a torrent and share a magnet link here. I know I'm not the only one who wants something like this. I don't think the file sizes will be so bad. My current "build" of the entire site is sitting at 1.36 GiB. (Only a little more than double the size of `node_modules`!) So, with browser compatibility data and such, I think it'll still be less than 2GiB.  Aggressively compressed with `bzip2 -9`, it's only 114.29 MiB. A compression ratio of 0.08. That blows my mind.
2022-10-26T09:11:42Z	(#hxac37q) 2 in the morning is a great time to compare compression algorithms.  ``` Ratio   File size   Filename            Command                     Algorithm       1  1458553185 build/   0.451   658022612 ../node-modules/   0.322   469704387 build.tar.Z         compress -k build.tar       Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) (oh, how far we've come)   0.185   269780511 build.tar.gz        gzip -k9 build.tar          Deflate   0.082   119839762 build.tar.bz2       bzip2 -zk9 build.tar        Burrows–Wheeler transform   0.047    68258612 build.tar.br        brotli -kZ build.tar        Brotli   0.047    67989604 build.tar.zst       zstd --ultra -22 build.tar  Zstandard   0.046    67705992 build.tar.xz        xz -zk9e build.tar          Lempel–Ziv–Markov (LZMA) ```  0.046 is *really* mind-blowing.

2022-10-26T21:14:59Z	(#wwxq6mq) [This document](gopher://bitreich.org/1/scm/gopher-protocol/file/gopher-extension.md.gph) was an interesting read, [posted by Hiltjo](https://lists.debian.org/gopher-project/2022/10/msg00013.html) in the second thread linked by @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>.  It's Bitreich's backwards-compatible standard for extensions to the Gopher protocol, including TLS.
2022-10-26T21:24:19Z	(#4epqdsa) > Is “Gopher + TLS” still “strictly Gopher”? Nah. But neither is using UTF-8 in Gopher pages and a loooooooot of people do that.  Also, I'm the line endings for just about everything Gopher are CRLF per RFC 1436. I'd be willing to bet that a lot of hand-written gophermaps use LF.

2022-10-26T21:43:13Z	(#hxac37q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I didn't time all of them, I probably should have, but `xz` has its own timer. If I remember correctly, it took 7 minutes and 17 seconds on my toaster to compress 1.36 GiB, mostly text, at the highest compression level. I don't think that's all that bad.  `xz` also lets you use multiple threads, which isn't common on these tools. I didn't do it for this test because there is an extremely small size penalty for doing so and I wanted to go all-out.  Here's a good [blog post](https://yeah.nah.nz/misc/xz-thread/) that shows the differences with multi-threading. The size difference is negligible, and that test showed no measurable difference in file size between 2 cores and 32 cores. There are diminishing returns in speed, though.

2022-10-29T06:41:23Z	Had a nice chat tonight with @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt>, and @<taigrr https://ndl.taigrr.com/user/taigrr/twtxt.txt>. Some things we talked about today:  - The release of yarnd 0.15 - Packaging apps for Sandstorm - SSD performance - KVM on WSL - Mitigating smart home spyware for in-store demos - https://github.com/berthubert/googerteller - Google's policies around using external code - The whirlpool currently taking place at Twitter  Also, we discovered an interesting statistic in the call tonight.  100% of technology enthusiasts have at least one Raspberry Pi, but only 25% of technology enthusiasts use them for anything.

2022-10-30T20:25:46Z	(#scxyieq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Is this about moderation or situations in which a user chooses to delete his or her own post?
2022-10-31T00:02:00Z	(#scxyieq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> If I was to run a pod, and I'd like to spin one up at some point, the abuse policy of twtxt.net (or any other pod) would be completely irrelevant. My users would be bound by the abuse policy of **my pod**, whether or my abuse policy matches yours.  Users on any pod should be free to mute any feed or conversation they dislike, and pod admins should be free to "mute" entire pods if they so choose.  I may be misunderstanding you here, but the motive behind this delete API seems to be to police the activities of users on other pods.  If a pod admin decides to delete a post on his pod as you have, that deletion should eventually be propagated throughout the network. It's the same if a user chooses to delete his own post. However, you should not have any say over the deletion of a post on twt.nfld.uk. That's @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt>'s decision to make.  I think @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> and I are in agreement here, but I don't want to speak for him.
2022-10-31T00:06:27Z	(#5ne755a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>  > Imagine if a pod operator decides a twt should be deleted, then this set off delete calls for that twt to all peered pods, which in turn propagate delete calls.  Fine, as long as the post is on *his own pod*. I don't think we need any kind of moderation on Pod A by the admin of Pod B. If a function like that is going to exist, it should at least be opt-in.
2022-10-31T00:14:43Z	(#f45oiqq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I agree. It should be as easy as possible to migrate a feed between pods.  A user of a pod certainly needs to trust the operator to some extent. Abuse of admin powers by the operator of your own pod isn't a big concern in theory because it can be countered by moving to a different pod or self-hosting your feed.  However, admin abuse is a real concern when the admin of a pod you're not using gets to police the content of your posts.
2022-10-31T00:20:42Z	(#scxyieq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> To be clear, you agree with me, but you say my understanding is correct? The understanding that the delete API is about policing the activities of users on **other pods**?
2022-10-31T00:25:03Z	(#g6qsidq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It seems very straight forward to do this automatically. When I delete my own post, how is that currently propagated to other pods?  We agree that the abuse of admin powers on his own pod is not a big concern because the software should protect the right of the users to migrate to a different pod.
2022-10-31T01:05:20Z	(#gq7wm6q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  > I honestly think the best way to handle this as we grow/scale with more pods in the Yarn.social network is to just build up a strong positive community and just have a “zero tolerance” attitude towards abuse and just nuke offending feeds/accounts without question.  I personally disagree with this moderation policy, but it's your right to enforce your rules as you see fit.  Perhaps there should be some kind of grace period, where anyone can download the contents of a "deleted" feed for *n* days before it gets removed entirely. That way, the user has the opportunity to download his feed and move it somewhere else and his followers have the opportunity to save an archive of the feed if they so choose.
2022-10-31T01:07:56Z	(#tzx77hq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> This is a very important ongoing discussion that must be had. I'm glad we all agree more than we disagree.

2022-10-31T20:46:39Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I tried out your mirror utility. It's a great start, but I ran into some issues.  1. It's creating the directory tree as it should, but the assets are incorrectly placed in the same directory as the document 2. The paths in the document should be rewritten to be relative instead of absolute 3. It respects robots.txt and there is no way to turn it off (I had to delete the file on my machine to make the tool work) 4. `<link rel="canonical">` isn't a page requisite, but the tool downloads the file at the specified URL anyway. (It doesn't respect robots.txt when doing this)  https://ttm.sh/0Pb.txt demonstrates the problems with the directory tree.
2022-10-31T22:32:40Z	Hey @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, I wanted to learn a bit of `jq` so I went hunting for spam accounts on git.mills.io using data from the API. [Here](https://ttm.sh/0PT.txt) are the results. I thought I'd find more than 11.
2022-10-31T23:21:12Z	(#oqo3q6a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> There's no script, it was mostly a manual process. I used jq, gron, grep, and awk to present the information in a reasonable way, then manually checked any accounts that looked suspicious. I looked at user descriptions, user URLs, and repositories.  It wasn't difficult to go through the data by hand after it was filtered a bit.  There are 195 registered users, only a handful of which have specified a description or URL.  There are 203 non-fork repositories, but only 27 of them are owned by entities other than `prologic`, `yarnsocial`, and `saltyim`. That `prologic` guy alone accounts for 152 of them.
2022-10-31T23:25:05Z	(#oqo3q6a) I'm sure there are a lot of old accounts you could delete that have never made any contributions, but that information isn't trivial to get from the API endpoints to which I have access.
2022-11-01T03:16:07Z	(#kp4v2wa) As a user of programs, it makes me groan to see a program written in anything but C or C++. In just about every other language, it's too easy to manage dependencies, and two problems arise.  1. [Microdependencies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd) 2. Feature creep because you can do *x* in 3 lines of code by adding this giant dependency. (Why does [gron](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron) need HTTP download support?)
2022-11-01T03:23:04Z	(#kp4v2wa) Also, because it's so annoying to manage dependencies with C and C++, there are often flags you can set to disable functionality related to a dependency if you don't need it.  Gron has no such option. Apparently there is no reason why you *wouldn't* want a text processing program to make network requests.
2022-11-01T03:38:35Z	(#w3lxsfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's not something I feel strongly about at all, I was just using it as an example. I like Gron a lot, actually.
2022-11-02T00:36:10Z	(#uy6mj4q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Welcome to the Walled Garden.
2022-11-02T05:54:07Z	(#gamo2nq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> Thanks for letting me know. It's easy to forget about topping up your account when you're paying 1 cent per day. :)  It's back up now.
2022-11-02T22:59:11Z	It's a beautiful fall afternoon and I have the day off. What are you all working on today? I've been working on a script that pulls in updates for a number of Git repositories at once in order to keep an updated local archive of them.  Today, I'm making it resilient against the maintainer force-pushing an empty branch in an attempt to foil archives. There's still some more work to do, but I just ran a successful test.  The complete history of the repository is backed up in the bundle before the evil maintainer's force push is brought in.  ![Output of my Git script when detecting a malicious forced push](https://twtxt.net/media/cyMxiQtZDtiJoSP5vCvUY6.png)
2022-11-02T23:01:36Z	(#g2frmqa) This can be mitigated under normal circumstances by assigning branches to the dangling commits before they're removed by Git's garbage collection.  However, this sort of malicious forced push can still cause a lot of damage, some of which can be very difficult to repair. It's better for archival purposes to make a full backup and then pull in the updates. A human can sort it out from there.
2022-11-03T01:08:27Z	(#g2frmqa) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> I keep seeing your name pop up in the RSS feed. Good work, man.  @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Interesting. Can you tell us more?
2022-11-03T01:08:43Z	(#nmsvt4a) @<cobra https://yn.vern.cc/user/cobra/twtxt.txt> It's crazy, isn't it?
2022-11-03T01:47:42Z	(#g2frmqa) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> Yes, there's a organization-wide feed at https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial.rss. The Gitea RSS integration is totally broken, but it at least lets me know when there are updates.  There's a repository feed at https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn.rss but it's even *more* broken.
2022-11-03T02:05:38Z	(#g2frmqa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sounds extremely frustrating. Is there any weird corporate spyware on there?
2022-11-03T18:34:41Z	(#yxsa4oa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> You're right, I copied the last note for the boilerplate and I forgot to change the date. It's fixed now.  The `Last-Modified` header probably accounts for the time it took in between setting the timestamp in the Atom feed and pushing the changes to the Web server.  @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt>, what's wrong with the RSS feed?

2022-11-03T23:12:28Z	(#ea5qacq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> That was a very interesting read. It's fun to compare my setup to others.  I'll bet it's nice to have an offline copy of your videos. I've been thinking about a program that interfaces with Newsboat's database directly, getting the URLs of all unread articles with a specific tag.  When it runs, it would queue new videos for download with yt-dlp and delete any videos in the cache directory that I've marked read in Newsboat. From there, I'd just need a wrapper script to look for the video in the local cache before letting MPV stream it.  I was working on a prototype of this system a few weeks ago, but my implementation was just too hacky and I got sidetracked.  Also, what program are you using for the syntax highlighting in the article? I've been thinking of doing that for my site.
2022-11-04T00:58:18Z	(#ea5qacq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I already launch MPV directly from Newsboat. If you pass a URL at the command line, it will use stream it with yt-dlp.  After I update my feeds, I do a lot of manual filtering, marking videos I don't want to watch as read. This would stop the cache system from downloading or storing videos I don't want to watch.  > This program, that downloads all required videos found in Newsboat’s SQLite database and removes them once marked read, that would be a cronjob? No user interaction required, did I get this right?  It could definitely be a cron job, but I think I'd rather have it as a hotkey in my window manager. That way, I could run a video cache update after I'm done marking unwanted videos as read. Other than that, there would be no interaction required.

2022-11-09T23:04:03Z	(#ctx4zca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Why not just have a Raspberry Pi or something with an external hard drive holding all your Linux ISOs, and connect that directly to the display? Then, it could run Kodi or Jellyfin on that display. It should also be able to start up a Wi-Fi network for streaming on other devices.  Plex might be able to do this, but I'm not sure how much they insist on handling authentication on their servers.

I understand what you're saying, but I find the duplicated functionality of the RSS `<guid>` to be confusing. I think it would make more sense if the roles were reversed: use the `<link>` as the ID if there's no `<guid>` and never use the `<guid>` as a permalink. Bonus points if a `<guid>` is required if a `<link>` is not present.  Actually, when doing research for this post, I stumbled upon this blog post: [How to make a good ID in Atom](https://web.archive.org/web/20110915110202/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/28/howto-atom-id)  I have no idea how I ended up at a blog post from 2004 that hasn't been online since 2011, but I did. Regardless, he has a point. I had never heard of [tag URIs](https://taguri.org/) before. I think I'll start using them.

2022-11-12T06:37:07Z	Another great chat with @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> tonight.  Some things we talked about:  * Time zones and DST * Mastodon and scalability * E-mail and decentralization * Twitter and Elon * New twtxt feeds popping up since the bird was freed  Also, @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> said he's not interested in ActivityPub integration for Yarn.social
2022-11-13T01:36:06Z	(#gypx24a) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> That's awesome! Is it just a page generator like mine or does it have its own Web server?  Coincidentally, my time table generator was the first useful thing I wrote in C.

2022-11-15T06:32:03Z	(#klyuyhq) I don't want to bring people here, at least those I know in real life, because I try to separate my real identity from my online identity.  This will change when the network grows bigger and there's a larger anonymity set, for lack of a better term.  Like @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> said, this is an extremely selfish reason, but it is my reason.
2022-11-15T06:33:01Z	(#5k2qr2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Twtxt is anti-social social media.

2022-11-15T07:39:03Z	(#gir4aca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think this is great. I'm excited to see the network grow because I believe in twtxt as an alternative to Twitter and the rest of them.  My concern from that thread was about mixing public and private identities because the network is still quite small.
2022-11-15T08:31:09Z	(#fa4nrla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I believe you mentioned me here because of my twt from earlier (#<pfmeyva https://twtxt.net/search?tag=pfmeyva>) and I wanted to clarify my position.  > your fears/worries about the “growth” may suddenly just hit us hard  I'm not afraid of the network growing, I'm actually very excited to see it grow. My concern was with keeping *my* real-life and online identities separate.

I think it's more than possible that we'll see outbound integration with twtxt. Kudos to Jeremy Potter for submitting that patch. He seems to have deleted his account on twtxt.net so I can't mention him properly.  As for inbound integration, I think a self-hosted bridge, independent from yarnd or any ActivityPub implementation, is the way to go.

2022-11-19T03:35:03Z	(#ys6zhea) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> The old classic iPods are great. They're repairable, modifiable, and they sound great too. Not at all like modern Apple devices. You can replace the spinning hard drive with flash storage, with capacities up to 2 TB on a 7th gen.  They can even run a [free operating system](https://www.rockbox.org/), allowing you to drag and drop music files onto the iPod (without iTunes) and play many different file formats. I use a 5th gen myself.
2022-11-19T20:21:16Z	(#ys6zhea) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> The 5th gen is much easier to work on than the 6th and 7th gen iPods. With those newer units, it's almost impossible to avoid ruining the back plate when opening it up. For those, you'll want to have a spare back plate before you start.  @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Only the 1st gen iPod had the scroll wheel. The 2nd and 3rd gen had a touch-sensitive wheel with separate buttons. The clickwheel (touch-sensitive wheel with integrated buttons) was introduced for the Mini and was used in all the main line iPods from the 4th generation on.
2022-11-19T22:06:09Z	(#ys6zhea) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> I had to look up some of the details on the [iPod Wiki](https://ipodwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page). :)

2022-11-21T22:42:45Z	(#vh5pwrq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> There can't be a concrete rule for this sort of thing. I'm generally in favor of reinventing the wheel to certain extent, but using a library can be very useful if you want to focus on the end result.  When your 5 dependencies each have 5 dependencies of their own, then you have a problem.
2022-11-21T23:27:30Z	(#vh5pwrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  > “dependency hell” comes from this “exponential dependency tree” that we inevitably see in ecosystems like NodeJS / NPM  Yes, and these "ecosystems" try to put a band-aid on it by allowing packages to specify which *version* of a package they need. All that means is you get 7 different versions of the same package bloating up your node_modules folder and 6 critical vulnerabilities from one package.  Then, it's impossible to keep track of all 1200 of your dependencies and sub-dependencies, so you get a robot to do it for you: Dependabot. What happens when Dependabot dies? Absolute chaos.  NodeJS library authors could just write better libraries and avoid breaking changes every update, and NodeJS software developers in general could fix their programs when they break, but they don't. It's on the "ecosystem" to solve for this, and it inevitably does a terrible job.
2022-11-21T23:30:01Z	(#vh5pwrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  > are there other examples?  Python, Ruby, Perl, Rust. Sometimes even Go. There's a little bit of this in every language with an official package manager. I'd say Python and NodeJS are the worst offenders, though.  > I feel like I pick on NodeJS / NPM too much  I don't think we pick on NodeJS/NPM *enough*.

You can buy a player at any time and play them. You can take them to a friend's house and play them there. You can even rip all your albums to digital files and copy them to your flash modded iPod.  In terms of durability, both CDs (pressed, not burned) and LPs will last a long time if you take care of them.  Youtube, Spotify, and Amazon offer convenience, but that convenience comes at the cost of your freedom. You are not permitted to do what you want with the content you paid for. You must also understand that you **will** lose access to that content at some time, occasionally without warning, and that time may be closer than you think.  The best of both worlds are DRM-free marketplaces like Qobuz, Gogs, and HDtracks.

2022-12-05T20:55:11Z	(#luwoonq) @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> I track a lot of repositories with a risk of becoming unavailable for whatever reason. The script tracks how many times in a row Git fails to fetch updates, so I can tell when a remote dies.  However, since it's so easy to add new ones, it's mostly repositories which aren't likely to disappear but carry a lot of value. For example, 143 MiB on my hard drive for the complete history of FFmpeg is a no-brainer for me.
2022-12-06T00:25:30Z	(#65sar6q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I haven't had any new problems. I've run into [#957](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/957) a few times, but that's about it.
2022-12-07T02:55:43Z	(#luwoonq) @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> A lot of my repositories are on the list specifically to guard against BS takedown requests like when youtube-dl was DMCA'd. I started the project when I discovered [Wikiless was taken down](https://orenom.fi/), so I have just about all of the popular self-hosted frontends as well.  Portal64 looks interesting, I haven't heard about it. I might need to get an N64 emulator going.
2022-12-07T04:20:01Z	(#luwoonq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> No, it's just private for now. I'll share individual repositories when they get nuked, of course. I'm open to the idea of making them publicly available, though.  I wonder if I could push to a Git remote with my current setup. That would be the simplest way to do public distribution *and* remote backups.  Also, Portal 64 kept freezing on me so I played F-Zero X instead.
2022-12-07T05:02:38Z	(#luwoonq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Git itself is a distributed network of mirrors. It's impossible to truly kill a Git repository as long as someone still has a clone of it on their computer.  However, simple clones are inefficient on disk space and a simple `git fetch` will happily obliterate its history if the remote says so.  My goals are as follows.  1. Create high quality archives of a large number of repositories and keep them up to date. 2. Make them resilient against attacks from the inside, including (but not limited to) force-pushing an empty history and maliciously deleting branches on the remote. 3. Minimize storage and bandwidth usage, including (but not limited to) running `git gc --aggressive` when cloning and not fetching unnecessary commits, e.g. Dependabot and pull requests.
2022-12-07T05:29:02Z	(#luwoonq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I appreciate it, but there's really nothing to "get involved" with at the moment. It's just a shell script on my laptop that I run every day and a ~5GiB directory on my SSD. It isn't a big deal, I just talk about it because I think it's interesting and I'm having fun tinkering with it.  Eventually, I'll make the script public so anyone can easily maintain archives. There's still a lot I want to do before that, though.
2022-12-08T07:07:14Z	(#dluhaca) @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> [City Planner Plays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8WAaaW2FnctRI9coYJoUdA) is a real urban planner that plays city building games using real-life concepts, teaching the viewers about them along the way. It's very addictive, and educational too.  I would recommend starting at the beginning of one of the cities (the videos are organized in YouTube playlists). Verde Beach is my personal favorite, but you can take your pick. It's extremely gratifying to watch a city grow from the ground up.

2022-12-10T19:06:53Z	(#aybkk4q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> This isn't uncommon in the US. In my house, there were always some presents under the tree well before Christmas. There were some for my parents from each other, or for me from other family members, but there were usually one or two for me from my parents, labeled as such. On Christmas morning, Santa would bring most of my presents.
2022-12-10T21:41:29Z	(#aybkk4q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> The 23rd? Why even bother with a tree at that point? We would usually have one about a week into December. They last much longer if you have one of those tree bases with a water reservoir.  That's interesting, we don't follow that procedure over here. The tree goes up, presents sit under it. As a child, I got to open presents from extended family members the night of Christmas Eve. Then, presents from Santa on Christmas morning and a big dinner that night. In my family, we'd have Thanksgiving dinner (turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, etc) again because none of us really liked ham, which was the most popular choice of entree.

2022-12-12T20:34:11Z	(#jh4n35a) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> We really need to stop using link shorteners and QR codes, but the damage is already done.  You can put a sticker with a QR code (and no other information) on a wall in a city and people will scan it out of curiosity. They scan it, their iPhone only tells them it goes to snapchat.com (I just checked on the latest version of iOS), and they end up on my website instead because it's an [open redirect](https://click.snapchat.com/aVHG?af_web_dp=https://mckinley.cc/).  Granted, my website is a much better place to be than snapchat.com, but you get the idea.
2022-12-12T23:23:21Z	(#jh4n35a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> QR codes and link shorteners can be useful, but people have been *trained* to click and scan things without doing their due diligence. Of course, mobile operating systems make it very difficult to do so because their goal is to remove as much control as is acceptable by the user.  As far as I know, you have to load the page in a browser before you can see the entire URL, giving it the opportunity to redirect somewhere else or exploit some vulnerability on your device.  I think we agree here. When the user has no control and is taught to blindly trust these things, bad things happen.
2022-12-12T23:28:42Z	(#5zbx3wa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> You could just point people directly to yarn.social. That could be a very effective guerrilla marketing campaign.

2022-12-20T07:05:20Z	(#w6f7o7a) As you've said, @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, it's impossible to monopolize twtxt because it's just a text file format. Also, Yarnd is under the AGPL, so anyone is free to fork it if they don't like where the project is going. Fortunately, it's under great leadership and development is steered more by the community than the owner of the repository.  Don't let it get to you, man. Interoperability with vanilla twtxt is the best feature of Yarn, and it's not worth breaking that because of one person. Besides, you won't win him over even if you do.

Or keep it simple?  I really don't know which would be better.  You would need user accounts for issues and to facilitate collaboration, unless you used e-mail, which isn't really a bad thing. The SourceHut model works very well.  No matter what, I would love to be able to archive issues using Git alone. You were talking about integrating git-bug or something similar, and I think that's an excellent idea.
2022-12-30T06:47:55Z	(#a7p6nyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I fully agree, but my thoughts on this are a little long for a twt.  Apple doesn't care about you: https://mckinley.cc/notes/20221229-apple-doesnt-care.html

2022-12-31T05:06:27Z	(#qaona2a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Of course you can censor people without being a nation-state. It's just a question of power. If @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> decided he didn't like what I have to say, he could add a line to the code of yarnd that automatically hides posts on all pods if it came from me. Would that not be censorship?
2022-12-31T05:08:24Z	(#5j6uwaq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Open registrations should be an option for pod admins. I would like to see a per-pod invite system, though.
2022-12-31T05:19:23Z	(#xcfydmq) I just realized that whole thing started with this thread. How did a post sharing a dial-in firework service in the terminal become a 5-fork-deep conversation about censorship on the Internet?
2022-12-31T19:03:10Z	(#qaona2a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I disagree. I think the "modern" definition of the word has a place here. An individual exercising his power over you on a platform to suppress you, not because you've violated any sort of rule, but because he doesn't like what you say, is at least an attempt at censorship. What would you call that?  If there was a rule that you've broken, then it's content moderation. A separate discussion can be had over whether or not that rule is just.  Fortunately, twtxt is very difficult to suppress completely. As long as I can still put a text file somewhere for people to download, I can still post.

They don't tell you that in the RSS feed, and I agree; it gets annoying.  If we had a custom feed generator that hooks directly into the YouTube API, I'll bet we could find that information and put "[Scheduled]" in the title for premieres and remove it when the video is available.

2023-03-11T22:15:57Z	(#zbsrabq) I'm worried that Yarn will become just another ActivityPub frontend. This integration threatens to split the community in two. Users of Twtxt clients without ActivityPub support won't want to follow Yarn users because they'll be engaged in conversations that are inaccessible to standard Twtxt clients. It will only force the split deeper if ActivityPub is an option to be toggled by users or pod operators.
2023-03-14T02:59:31Z	(#7w2qk7q) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Surely you can configure the wallet to use a remote node. I've heard good things about Feather Wallet if you want something friendlier. https://github.com/feather-wallet/feather
2023-03-14T03:09:32Z	(#7w2qk7q) Oh, I just saw the other thread. Don't put your *wallet* on the VPS unless you have a specific reason to do so. If you do, make sure your keys are stored on a local machine. It's fine to run a node there, but run the wallet locally and configure it to use your node if you can.
2023-03-14T03:22:22Z	(#ikhztpq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's significantly cheaper to open an exchange and get people to hold their money in a custodial wallet than it is to perform a 51% attack on an established cryptocurrency.  Monero in particular uses an algorithm that's supposed to be ASIC resistant and, while it can be mined on a GPU, it's more efficient to mine on a CPU. I'm curious if that makes it easier or harder for a hostile entity to perform a 51% attack.

I don't want to use cloud storage, so I'll be moving hard drives around. I'm just not sure on what to do on the software side.  Solutions like Restic and Borg have many advantages, but the disadvantage is that your data is confined to that particular tool.

The implication is that there may be downtime on my site but I haven't noticed any since April of 2020 when I began hosting with them. It's 1 cent per day as a base cost for that plan.  I also pay $1 per gigabyte-month for storage and I am using 9.29 MiB which means I pay a little less than one cent per month. It used to be even less than that, but since I started using Git the complete Git history is stored on the server as well as the live copy of the site.  There is an additional charge of 1 cent per 44.64 "RAUs", their measurement combining CPU and memory usage over time. On the Non-Production plan, only resources used by processes other than the Web server are counted. I don't believe I have ever been charged for this.  Here is my billing report for 2023 so far.  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/KWid3oP7PFA5sD4dh2zxDm.png)
2023-08-16T03:52:49Z	(#556kg2a) To get such a low price, I am forgoing the ability to open a private support ticket. Any questions I've ever had were answered by the very thorough FAQ, but if one wanted that ability they could pay an additional $5 per month for a subscription membership.  I would also like to add that their entire Web portal works without JavaScript and it has all the features you would expect and more.
2023-08-20T02:58:37Z	(#556kg2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm glad I could help. You're working on a service similar to NearlyFreeSpeech in its usage-based pricing model but built around docker containers instead? It seems very useful. How will you handle payment? Will there be privacy-friendly options like Monero or cash-by-mail?
2023-08-20T03:14:37Z	(#556kg2a) I might have a use for something like this right now, actually. I want to set up an XMPP server for a few people without giving out my home IP address. It would probably handle 20 messages per day on average. I really don't have a use for a VPS beyond this and I would be paying for a lot more than I need.  How will ports be allocated? Web traffic can go through a reverse proxy to share ports 80 and 443, but what about other protocols? Will it be possible to request specific ports like 5222 and 5269 for XMPP?
2023-08-20T04:21:30Z	(#556kg2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I had to do some research for this one. The answer is yes, in theory, as long as the client or server supports XEP-0368. However, this seems like the kind of thing that would be skipped by lazy implementations. I would be interested to see how this looks in practice.  SRV records are used in the XMPP core specification to determine the domain and port to which clients and servers (for s2s connections) should connect. [XEP-0368](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0368.html) is an extension to the spec detailing how servers and clients should handle SRV records in relation to TLS connections. It says that the "Client or server MUST set SNI TLS extension to the JID's domain part."  As an aside, SRV records alone can be used, in theory, to change the default port used in c2s or s2s connections. If the ports were assigned randomly from the hosting provider, they could be specified in the SRV records and everything would hopefully just work. Again, I don't know how well this is supported in practice.
2023-08-20T08:39:56Z	(#556kg2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Protocols using TLS could probably share ports via SNI multiplexing. If you're using a plain text protocol or can't use SNI for some reason, you might have the option to get exclusive use of a random port for an extra fee. You could maybe even request specific ports for a larger fee on a first come, first serve basis. One IPv4 address can go a long way.  Virtual hosting is another reason why it's so cheap to run my website. NFS puts [dozens of websites](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&sort=RELEVANCE&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=ONLY&q=ip%3D208.94.118.135) on each IPv4 address.

There is something to completely understanding a piece of software, reading all the documentation, and writing a config file by hand. However, if you aren't doing it as a hobby project and you aren't being paid a lot of money to do it "right" I definitely see the appeal of Docker. I started using it for some of the more annoying software packages when I set up my home server.

2023-10-03T04:11:05Z	(#2loozoq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yes, you can only get a number in the US or Canada for now.
2023-10-03T21:09:34Z	(#a56s6mq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> The thing is, if it didn't connect to the Internet on its own, it would be basically fine. You could make a device like this that communicates directly with an app on your phone. The app would spy on you, I'm sure, but just about all of the user-facing features I can see could be done in the app alone and the plate could be updated over Bluetooth or something. You could prevent people from incorrectly changing their registration year or plate number with cryptographic signatures from either Reviver or the DMV, which I hope they're doing already.  Of course, on a phone, you have all those pesky permissions that people can turn off.
2023-10-05T23:05:06Z	(#su6xrna) That article links to [this one](https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-might-want-to-be-making-windows-12-a-subscription-os-suggests-leak/).  So, you buy a new computer for $800 and you have to pay a subscription just to use it? There's no doubt the subscription will start out optional, but if things continue the way they're going we will get there. When that day comes, the general public will get out their credit cards and do what the computer says. I have no faith whatsoever that they won't.  Of course, by that time, I imagine you won't be able to turn off Secure Boot or enroll your own keys on most computers, making your computer an appliance completely owned by Microsoft, just like an iPad is completely owned by Apple.
2023-10-06T00:28:54Z	(#a56s6mq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> That's already the case where I live. There are also some DMV kiosks in public places, usually grocery stores, and you can renew your registration right there. If I remember correctly, it will even print your updated registration and give you the sticker for your license plate so you don't have to wait for the mail.

That is the point of Microsoft® Secure Boot after all.  Another thing about i{Pad,}OS, it's impossible to use it without an online account with the operating system vendor. Windows, of course, is getting increasingly harder to use without a Microsoft account. The goal is clear.

Yesterday evening, I started ntfsresize while SSHed from my laptop right before I realized I needed to go somewhere, with my laptop. Usually, I'm pretty good at starting a tmux session before doing something like that, but reptyr saved me and all the data is intact, which is very cool.

2023-10-17T04:22:32Z	(#egaqyla) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> As it turns out, btrfs is very cool. I've always used one big root partition, but getting the advantages of root+home partitions with no downside is just one reason why I'll probably use btrfs on my next OS install. It could be a while, I'm a little sentimental about this one on ext4.  ``` $ head -n 1 /var/log/pacman.log  [2021-08-15T21:36:08+0000] [PACMAN] Running 'pacman -r /mnt -Sy --cachedir=/mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg --noconfirm base linux linux-firmware networkmanager nm-applet i3wm base-devel vim' ```
2023-10-17T04:42:04Z	(#egaqyla) An update on the NTFS situation: I got a reproducible ntfs3-related kernel panic on my server just by reading every file with md5sum on the NTFS I actually want to back up with ntfsclone. It very well could have been related to mounting it partition read-only or using a USB to SATA adapter. I'll try it again another time, probably on a machine that isn't doing anything else important. I don't know if I finally encountered the instability they talk about on Arch or if the ntfs3 driver just isn't there yet. ntfs-3g has been okay for reads in my experience, but I've had issues writing.

2023-10-24T23:10:57Z	Does anyone have any personal experience with [Spiral Linux](https://spirallinux.github.io/)? It is just preconfigured Debian + your choice of DE installed with Calamares. After the installation is completed, you aren't dependent on anything except the existing Debian infrastructure which is, of course, rock-solid.
2023-10-30T05:40:45Z	(#p3wvpva) First Impressions of SpiralLinux: https://mckinley.cc/blog/20231029.xhtml
2023-10-30T23:15:35Z	(#p3wvpva) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Ubuntu was the first distribution I used. I didn't know what I was doing and broke the bootloader trying to do something related to dual booting and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. I went back to Windows after that.  Many still recommend it as a first distribution. While I'm sure it's still well polished and easy to use, I don't like Ubuntu because of Canonical's [shady practices](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.en.html) in the past and their move toward Snaps instead of Debian-style packages.  SpiralLinux seems like the best of both worlds. I'm really very impressed. If you are looking for a distribution for some one who isn't so technical, but also something easy to fix when it breaks, consider looking into it. Use a different password for root, restrict sudo, mount /home with `noexec`, configure unattended upgrades, and I think it'd be very solid. It is just Debian Stable after all.
2023-11-13T19:13:24Z	(#urautqa) @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> Looks good, but how come I have to enable JavaScript and cookies to "verify" my request? It doesn't look like Cloudflare.
2023-11-13T22:30:09Z	(#ressqqa) @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> If I go to your website, it makes my browser complete a JavaScript challenge and send the result to a special location on your domain using a form called "wsidchk". After I complete that I get a cookie and I can browse your website freely. It isn't Cloudflare. I imagine it's because I'm using a VPN service with somewhat disreputable IP addresses. Is this something your hosting provider does automatically?
2023-11-15T21:45:06Z	(#d55lmza) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Today I learned this package is installed on my computer. Unnecessary dependencies are really annoying on Arch. If I switch to Gentoo this will be a major reason why.

2023-11-17T20:17:10Z	(#peqf4kq) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> There is HTTPS but it doesn't seem to be enforced. My browser always connects with TLS if it's available and the message is present with or without TLS or extensions, even when using cURL. I would notice if my VPN service injected things like this because I disable JavaScript and cookies by default. I think it's  unlikely I'm being MiTMed because the certificate is definitely from Let's Encrypt. Also, I don't see the point in MiTMing me just to put a JavaScript challenge on someone's personal website.  I still think it's a hosting provider thing. It doesn't really matter to me, I'm just curious.

2024-01-26T03:32:52Z	(#hav3dva) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Probably not the most helpful reply, but I posted my thoughts in a [note](https://mckinley.cc/notes/20240125-website-builders.xhtml). Websites are really complicated and there's a lot that goes into making one. When you put too many layers of abstraction on it, you have to cut corners somewhere.
2024-01-26T03:56:58Z	(#hav3dva) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's true that the major players in the WYSIWYG-website-for-dummies industry not only function poorly but are also proprietary SaaS garbage. However, I don't know if it's really possible to make them function any better. HTML and CSS just aren't made for that.
2024-01-26T04:21:58Z	(#hav3dva) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That looks pretty nice. It seems like the pricing model is reasonable as well. They don't try to nickel-and-dime you with features most people would probably need like others I've seen. Good luck with it.
2024-02-05T20:47:43Z	(#mouv5ba) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Pretty much. In my situation I was able to delete some files and snapshots and run a couple of different `btrfs balance` commands to move some allocations around. It looked like writes weren't all committed properly to the disk but nothing told me that explicitly.  I did a system update in this state and I think I remember mkinitcpio throwing more warnings than usual but I was doing something else and I didn't pay close attention to them. This coincided with a power outage and there was a lot of inconsistency, making me think it was hardware related. It was just btrfs, as far as I can tell, and I fixed it by reinstalling all the packages on the system once there was enough room. Luckily, I hadn't done anything important with that computer after the system update.
2024-02-06T23:23:46Z	(#mouv5ba) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yeah, it seems like that should never happen under any circumstances but that's the best explanation I can come up with for what happened and once I fixed the space issue the other problems went away. That particular filesystem is on a LUKS device on a disk image served with NBD. The machine in question and the NBD server are both on Arch Linux so it has potentially unstable versions of all the software involved.  It's a real house of cards and I'm not surprised something like this happened. I'm keeping lots of backups. My setup is pretty unique but I stand by my original post. Running out of space on Btrfs isn't fun, even when it's functioning properly.

2024-02-16T00:02:40Z	(#wij4nza) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt>. Let's see. I just followed @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> and I only typed `@bender` just now.
2024-02-16T00:02:50Z	(#wij4nza) Hey, it worked! I just had to refresh the conversation page.
2024-02-16T00:22:48Z	PSA: If you're on Arch Linux and you want to use some of your own scripts on multiple machines, it is incredibly easy to write a PKGBUILD. Then, you can scp the built package around and install it with `pacman -U`. Let Pacman handle your dependencies so they can easily be removed later and only when they're no longer required.
2024-02-17T07:04:11Z	QOTD: What are your thoughts on [nostr](https://fiatjaf.com/nostr.html)?
2024-02-17T19:27:54Z	(#aajeezq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> How so?
2024-02-18T00:25:11Z	(#g7eelyq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>  >I fear it’s a rather complicated protocol.  The [core protocol](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md) looks very simple but I'm sure you can get in the weeds with extensions.   >you can’t really change your keys without losing your identity  I think you're right but that seems reasonable to me. Your public key *is* your identity, similar to certain cryptocurrencies or Tor hidden services. Why would you want to change your key without changing your identity?
2024-02-18T05:55:12Z	(#g7eelyq) Something I've noticed about the Nostr people is that they aren't the same as the software minimalism people. It seems like it's all JavaScript, Go, and Rust with dependency counts in the hundreds.
2024-02-19T00:18:26Z	(#aajeezq) All three of your points on usability are definitely true, especially #3. I haven't been able to find a good TUI client.  Regarding the technical points, it seems like there are mechanisms to address each of them. Please tell me if I'm wrong on any one of these. I have only been learning about Nostr for a short time.  1. Relays aren't a single point of failure because a user can (and should) post to many of them. The attacker in a censorship or sabotage scenario would have to take down every one of your relays at once. If they were taken down gradually, you could replace the bad relay with a new one and advertise that one on all the other relays your followers already use. It's much more resilient compared to twtxt.  2. Every event contains a signature from your private key, so it's hard to spoof. [NIP-10](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/10.md) provides a method for marking a note as a reply to another note.
2024-02-19T00:18:33Z	(#aajeezq) * (3) Does Nostr require clients to download much more data than, say, Twitter? I can see it being a little more because of signatures, etc. However, text compresses well and clients should cache previous posts, anyway.   * (4) [NIP-96](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/96.md) does HTTP file upload, XMPP style. There are some other advanced features like [tipping on posts](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md), [custom emojis](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/30.md), and [at](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/15.md) [least](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/99.md) [three](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md) conventions for selling goods and services.  Of course, not everything is available with every client and some of the specs are still being worked out. It looks promising to me, though. I like its distributed model with dumb servers and smart clients. The software will get better over time.
2024-02-19T07:59:22Z	(#mnpnvda) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> That's an interesting idea. Twt hashes still need a canonical URL to work, though.
2024-02-20T06:26:20Z	Seriously, where is the suckless-style Nostr client?
2024-02-23T23:34:20Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> has there been any development on cas.run?
2024-02-24T02:41:47Z	(#yl2illa) Okay, is there at least a JavaScript-free Web client?
2024-02-24T22:37:07Z	(#yl2illa) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> You are absolutely right, that would be terrible. The whole point of Nostr is to own your identity. I don't know what I was thinking.
2024-02-27T23:49:51Z	(#zwpd7hq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> `key=value\n` or JSON. YAML is the worst and I don't understand why it's so popular.
2024-02-28T21:23:14Z	(#zwpd7hq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Lack of comments are definitely a shortcoming of JSON. I don't like TOML because it lets you have nested categories (`[foo] [foo.bar] [foo.baz]`) and it just feels confusing to me, even with indentation. Simple INI files are okay.  The Prosody XMPP server's configuration file is just a Lua script because Prosody is written in Lua, and that's excellent.
2024-02-28T21:40:41Z	(#qfgb2jq) I spent hours creating a perfect Prosody config for my most recent XMPP server attempt (about 2-3 years ago now) and I lost that file because I deleted the VPS. That was the only important file on there and I just didn't think of it when I deleted it. I didn't have a single backup, not even an old copy I `scp`ed back to my PC for editing.  I hope I won't make that mistake again but I wouldn't be surprised if I did.
2024-02-28T21:47:37Z	(#zwpd7hq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Regarding YAML's readability, I miss the `-` for list items *constantly* when reading YAML files. I'll get confused because I think I'm not in a list or I'm in the previous list item, then I have to go back. List items are all on the same indentation column and one tiny character is the only thing defining a new one. I don't know if others have this problem.
2024-02-29T21:12:48Z	(#xrqwxta) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> [gron](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron) does something very similar with JSON. I used to use it more, but these days I just reach for jq instead.
2024-02-29T21:15:28Z	(#h3tubna) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Blank lines help a lot.
2024-03-01T01:08:04Z	(#p5z5aga) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> The thing that really unlocked jq for me was learning how to get a TSV output. That was a complete game changer, because it meant I could easily use it in a shell pipeline. I found it to be better than gron for that purpose. Just make an array for each item containing all the values you need and pipe it to the filter `@tsv`.  ``` $ # Search YouTube using the Invidious API for "never gonna give you up" and write the results to out.json $ curl -sGL -A 'Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; x86_64) Ladybird/1.0' -o out.json --data-urlencode 'q=never gonna give you up' 'https://farside.link/invidious/api/v1/search'  $ jq -r '.[] | select(.type == "video") | [ .title, .author, .authorVerified, .videoId ] | @tsv' out.json Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Official Music Video)	Rick Astley	true	dQw4w9WgXcQ Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up [Lyrics]	GlyphoricVibes	true	QdezFxHfatw InsurAAAnce & Rick Astley Never Gonna Give You Up	CSAA Insurance Group, a AAA Insurer	true	GtL1huin9EE [...] ```
2024-03-01T21:38:12Z	(#7uxy6nq) I agree with @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt>. WebFinger and WebMentions are very much in the spirit of Twtxt and both of them are already in use. If we're going to do much more than that, we should probably just use Nostr instead.
2024-03-02T19:46:57Z	(#rjfiy7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> So, you're automatically downloading videos by a select few YouTube channels and putting them into Plex? Interesting. When do you think your kids will figure out how to get around your block? :)
2024-03-04T23:18:14Z	QOTD: Do you keep a personal archive of Git repositories? If so, how? My backup system is a poorly written, inefficient shell script that I run manually when I think about it and I'd like to do something about that. The Yuzu and Citra emulators were taken down recently and I have a ~3 day old backup of Yuzu's repository but nothing for Citra.
2024-03-05T06:04:23Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I've thought about that, but it seems awfully inefficient to host a full code forge with a Web interface just to mirror some Git repositories.
2024-03-05T06:07:22Z	(#jrucdka) How does Gitea store repositories? Are they just bare Git repositories on the filesystem that can be cloned separately? Also, how does it handle the upstream force-pushing an empty repository? Will that destroy your archive?
2024-03-05T07:46:36Z	(#jrucdka) Whoops, I started a thread when I meant to reply to the other one. I don't think I've ever done that before.
2024-03-06T07:21:11Z	(#iee7bsq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Agreed.
2024-03-06T09:57:15Z	QOTD: What are some (GNU/|)Linux distributions that think outside the box? I'll start.  * [Bedrock Linux](https://bedrocklinux.org/) - A "meta distribution" that uses black magic to install packages from any distribution you can think of * [GoboLinux](https://gobolinux.org/) - A distribution that uses black magic to eradicate the standard filesystem hierarchy and give each package its own directory tree, e.g. `/Programs/GCC/9.2.0`. It's been around for a whopping 21 years.  There are also the well-known ones like NixOS, Qubes, and even Gentoo but I don't see those two mentioned very often.
2024-03-06T20:39:45Z	(#dpa3swq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> How could I forget? :)
2024-03-07T21:32:34Z	(#dpa3swq) There isn't anything too far out of the ordinary there, but I like the idea of [Chimera Linux](https://chimera-linux.org/). It's a new independent distribution, free of legacy cruft, aiming to create a simple yet practical modern desktop system. Interestingly, it uses [Dinit](https://davmac.org/projects/dinit/) rather than Systemd or OpenRC.  There are also a small handful of what I call "micro-distributions" like [Static Linux](https://sta.li/), [KISS Linux](https://github.com/kisslinux), and [Oasis Linux](https://github.com/oasislinux/oasis) which aim to create the simplest possible desktop Linux system while still having a usable package system. Some might (justifiably) call them toy distros, but I think they're neat.
2024-03-09T18:30:58Z	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> What happened to your Gopher server?
2024-03-10T06:31:07Z	(#yqz7kvq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> That's an excellent point, I never thought about it that way before. I have always tried to be very conservative with the CSS on my website and my class names mostly reflect what they are.  Actually, I've had a new part of my website almost completed for a while, but I'm hung up on it because flex boxes are pretty much required to do what I want with the home page. My stylesheet has always been valid CSS 2 and I'm not sure I want to ruin that.
2024-03-10T10:05:46Z	(#n66yp3q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> That makes a lot of sense. I agree it's probably a better use of time to maintain a nice, simple website.
2024-03-10T10:14:52Z	(#yqz7kvq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> There's nothing wrong with that. I just do it because I like well-defined standards and as a sort of protest against the "Living Standards". I also take care to make my website look reasonable even when CSS isn't available, especially in terminal browsers.
2024-03-10T23:13:43Z	(#dpa3swq) @<shreyan https://twtxt.net/user/shreyan/twtxt.txt> Yes. It uses the FreeBSD core tools. https://chimera-linux.org/about/#alternative-userland
2024-03-11T17:52:32Z	(#yqz7kvq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I think [Browsh](https://www.brow.sh/) is fairly new but it doesn't really count as it's just a frontend for Firefox. I haven't heard of any new, real, text-based browsers.
2024-03-11T19:17:34Z	(#ovkzvfa) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Neat. Are you going to try your luck solo mining?
2024-03-13T04:51:11Z	(#ovkzvfa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Solo mining at 450 Gh/s, it's a 1 in 8,765,713 chance per day of mining a block, so it would take roughly 24,000 years on average. Think of it like playing the lottery. It sounds kind of fun to me.
2024-03-13T04:59:06Z	(#a4gv6ea) I can't believe software developers are still trying to get people to do `curl | sh`. It's easy to miss the problem if you're still in the mindset of Windows software distribution, but these people are writing software on GNU/Linux, for GNU/Linux. You would think they'd realize that this is *never* a good idea.
2024-03-13T05:02:41Z	(#7tvi5wq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> I don't mind the character limit. If I hit it and I still have more to say, it's a good reminder that I should probably write a [note](https://mckinley.cc/notes/) instead. I like to [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) anything that might have value outside of the current conversation.
2024-03-13T05:28:30Z	QOTD: What do you host on your home server? How do you host it? Are you using containers? VMs? Did you install any management interface or do you just SSH in? What OS does it run?  Mine runs Arch (btw) and hosts a handful of things using Docker. Adguard Home, http://mckinley2nxomherwpsff5w37zrl6fqetvlfayk2qjnenifxmw5i4wyd.onion/, a Monero node, and some others. NFS, Flexo, and Wireguard (peer and bounce server in my personal network) are outside Docker. I have a hotkey in my window manager that spawns a terminal on my server using SSH. It makes things very easy and I highly recommend it.  I am thinking about replacing Docker with Podman because the Common Wisdom seems to say it's better. I don't really know if it is or isn't.  Also, how much of your personal infrastructure is on IPv6? I think all the software I use supports both, but I've mostly been using IPv4 because it's easier to remember the addresses. I've been working for the last couple days on making it IPv6-only.
2024-03-13T17:37:06Z	(#ovkzvfa) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> What kind of hashrate are you getting on that thing?
2024-03-13T17:43:10Z	(#uor3zya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Wow. I didn't know the Mills DC was that serious. How much storage do you have and how is it set up?
2024-03-13T17:57:26Z	(#7tvi5wq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> That's fair and I understand if you don't want to click through to another website just to get my thoughts on WYSIWYG website builders. However, my website is much better than a WYSIWYG one. It has absolutely no JavaScript or tracking (not even Web server access logs) and it will work on just about any browser that won't die the moment it sees XHTML.  If I'm putting a lot of effort into a piece of writing, I'd rather have it on my website that I control rather than someone else's. No offense @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> :)
2024-03-13T18:12:57Z	(#zm5qtpq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> It's possible for a Web server to detect whether or not you're piping the output into a shell and change its output based on that, which makes `curl | sh` so much worse in my opinion.  https://web.archive.org/web/20240311094552/https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2016/04/detecting-curl-pipe-bash-server-side/

2024-03-13T19:44:31Z	(#zm5qtpq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Maybe it's just a cargo cult thing (pun intended) because it's somehow an accepted way to install a piece of software.
2024-03-13T22:17:04Z	(#uor3zya) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Wow. txt.sour.is has IPv6, so are you hosting it on one of those VMs or is it a reverse proxy back home?

2024-03-14T04:50:11Z	(#lpcaiaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I looked up BurmillaOS and this is definitely one for my thread about unique Linux distributions. Very interesting.  > Everything in BurmillaOS is a Docker container. We accomplish this by launching two instances of Docker. One is what we call System Docker and is the first process on the system. All other system services, like ntpd, syslog, and console, are running in Docker containers. System Docker replaces traditional init systems like systemd and is used to launch additional system services.
2024-03-14T04:52:33Z	(#uor3zya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Usable? Impressive. You can fit a lot of ISOs in 22 TB. Are you doing ZFS?
2024-03-14T17:34:26Z	(#3clq7eq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Nice. I've been thinking of doing something similar for my website so I can host more services at mckinley.cc.

I'm saying that Windows in general should be considered a legacy operating system, and continued usage will only make you subject to more of this tracking and unnecessary garbage.  In other words, the situation will never improve. It will only get worse from here, so you might as well get out now while there are still plenty of life boats. Otherwise, when they do something that's really over the line, you either have to go along with it or dive right into the cold ocean.  Windows is only kept alive at this point by a lack of knowledge about the alternatives, apathy, fear, and some enterprise software and games with support in Wine improving by the day.

2024-03-29T18:58:10Z	(#dyqjn5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> He didn't like LibreOffice Writer? Is he used to Microsoft Word or Apple Pages? I've had success getting non-technical Office refugees on LibreOffice, specifically Writer. Most people don't need any fancy features and most things are located close enough to their counterparts on Word.  I show them how to export their documents as PDF before they share them with others and I use the (somewhat) immutability of PDFs and their portability (bundled fonts, rigid formatting, etc) to sell it. Those are two real benefits, but the main reason is that I don't trust other software to handle ODTs and I don't trust LibreOffice to write DOCXes. Although, I don't know if I really need to be worried about either of them with basic documents. It's probably worth investigating.
2024-04-01T05:12:37Z	QOTD: How do you listen to your music?  I'll start. I have a meticulously organized FLAC library stored locally on my laptop and played with cmus. Everything is manual but I have a collection of home-grown shell scripts that help me maintain folder structure, manage metadata, calculate information about the recording like dynamic range and spectrograms, and do transformations like cue splitting. Once an album has been processed, it goes into the music folder on my laptop with a duplicate copy stored on my server.  I have been thinking about letting [beets](https://beets.io/) do all of that boring stuff, but I'm not sure I can trust it to do it right. I also really want some kind of (self hosted) algorithm to pick songs for me. As it is, I can't just shuffle my library or even genres because there are a lot of songs that don't go well together as well as songs I just don't like. I haven't found anything that can do that.  Anyway, I'm curious to see how you guys do it.
2024-04-01T17:50:44Z	(#jfzitsa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Interesting. mpd + ncmpcpp seems to be a common setup among our type but I really like cmus. [Whipper](https://github.com/whipper-team/whipper) is my CD ripper of choice and it is excellent. It queries AccurateRip for checksums and MusicBrainz for metadata, and can encode to any format you want. It also creates a nice log file like EAC does (it can even create EAC-compatible logs with a [plugin](https://github.com/whipper-team/whipper-plugin-eaclogger)) so you can verify that it was ripped properly.
2024-04-02T05:35:08Z	(#jfzitsa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Plexamp has some really cool features. It's a shame it's proprietary and dependent on central services.

2024-04-14T06:31:25Z	(#sa4jlsq) You could get better value for money with a super cheap VPS without IPv4 connectivity but it wouldn't be worth it if you didn't need the extra resources as a VPS wouldn't be practical with such low specs. It would also require significantly more effort on the part of the operator.  I would understand paying a small premium for using the lowest-cost tier, convenience, and especially if you operated a reverse proxy with IPv4 connectivity.
2024-04-14T17:04:38Z	(#sa4jlsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> $0.15 sounds great but you need to make money doing this. Is it still going to be use-based pricing or will there be tiers like conventional VPS providers?
2024-04-14T17:09:06Z	(#lkr7vhq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> You could always keep it running in a detached tmux session and attach it when you see the spike. Processes that were recently using the netwotk stay in the list for 10 or 15 seconds after they're finished so you don't have to catch it in the act.
2024-04-14T18:03:07Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I might have mentioned this already but you might want to look into [MoneroPay](https://moneropay.eu/) for payment processing when you get to that point with cas.run. It's a completely self-hosted backend service for receiving and tracking Monero payments and it's written in Go.
2024-04-15T07:15:54Z	(#2hmj7aq) Monero uses cryptography to make transactions anonymous and the coins completely fungible. With most cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, the transactions associated with an address are public and you can trace those coins all the way back to their origin. This means that not all coins are the same. For example, some exchanges won't accept Bitcoin that comes from a mixer because they assume you're doing something untoward.  With Monero, it's not possible to trace any transactions with just an address. People can't see what you're spending your money on or where your coins came from. Transaction fees using Monero are also very small. It's less than the equivalent of 1 cent in USD.  Minuscule transaction fees and anonymity make it the best choice in my opinion for buying goods and services online. Monero is much more like "digital cash" than Bitcoin, which I think is better described as "digital gold".
2024-04-15T07:33:20Z	(#sa4jlsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That sounds great. The only other container-level hosting service I've heard of is [PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/) which seems much more managed than cas.run would be. It has customizable tier-based pricing and the minimum specs are 1/4 of a CPU core, 256 MB of memory, and "about 100 MB" of storage for $1/mo which seems awfully steep compared to a low-cost VPS. I don't know if PikaPods offers an IPv4 reverse proxy or not.
2024-04-15T07:38:08Z	(#sa4jlsq) Actually, [kyun.host](https://kyun.host/) might offer container hosting at some point.  > On-demand Linux containers. > Run almost anything, without having to touch the command line. > Coming Soon  https://kyun.host/services
2024-04-15T16:12:34Z	(#sa4jlsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm in if you accept XMR
2024-04-15T16:38:30Z	(#2hmj7aq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Monero has stayed a little more stable than Bitcoin but it's still a cryptocurrency and it's still going to fluctuate quite a bit. It also uses proof-of-work algorithm so it still consumes quite a bit of electricity. I think the value of being able to send any amount of money, any time of the day, to anyone on the planet in 20 minutes (appears in 2 minutes, spendable in 20) **completely privately** with near-zero transaction fees exceeds the drawbacks.  Unfortunately, the characteristics that make it useful as a global currency for day-to-day transactions also make it useful for people doing illicit things. Many exchanges, fearing regulatory action, won't accept Monero for the same reason they won't accept Bitcoin from a mixer.  Monero shouldn't be banned just because people use it for bad things. It's just a tool and it can be used for good or evil. It's the same reason countries use when they ban or restrict Tor usage.
2024-04-15T16:47:38Z	(#lkr7vhq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> It's very useful. I always start my music player in a tmux session so I can SSH in, attach it, and control the music from another computer. It's also handy for letting long-running tasks on a remote machine continue in the background even if the SSH connection is broken.
2024-04-16T17:35:22Z	(#4sjthna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I concur. This little community of ours is here because of you, and I'm very grateful for that. :)
2024-04-17T04:32:51Z	(#2kzsn4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Is it really banned? I thought the regulators just pressured the centralized exchanges to delist privacy coins without actually banning them outright.
2024-04-17T22:33:52Z	(#mdhkbsa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I use [LocalMonero](https://localmonero.co/) ([onion](http://nehdddktmhvqklsnkjqcbpmb63htee2iznpcbs5tgzctipxykpj6yrid.onion/)) to buy Monero with cash sent by mail. You can sell on there if you want to convert back to fiat. People also like [Bisq](https://bisq.network/), which is peer-to-peer software for buying and selling cryptocurrency.  To accept Monero, all you need is a wallet program. I recommend [Feather Wallet](https://featherwallet.org/). Create your wallet in there, then you'll copy the wallet files into monero-wallet-rpc for use with MoneroPay, see [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/moneropay/moneropay/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml).
2024-04-21T06:14:53Z	(#7ef2sea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> This seems like it would drive a wedge between Yarn.social and the people on regular old twtxt.
2024-04-21T06:56:32Z	(#nlzhexa) I use KeePassXC because I really only use one device. I imagine it would be challenging to rsync the database around if I needed my passwords on more machines. It's probably fine if you're deliberate enough, but I don't think it would take long before I'd lose a password by editing an outdated version of the repository and overwriting the main copy.  I like the simple architecture of Pass, and it would indeed lend itself well to a Git repository, but I don't like that service names are visible on the filesystem. [pass-tomb](https://github.com/roddhjav/pass-tomb) might mitigate this somewhat but it seems messy and I don't know if it would work with Git without compromising the security of the tomb.  What's so good about Bitwarden? Everyone seems to love it. I like that it can be self-hosted. I certainly wouldn't want a third party in control of my password database.
2024-04-21T16:39:41Z	(#nlzhexa) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> I've never had a use for Syncthing but I hope I get one at some point so I can see how it works. Do three-way merges work on Keepass database files?
2024-04-21T21:21:13Z	QOTD: How do you back up your files?  I asked this one [almost a year ago](https://search.twtxt.net/search?q=%23xa73jea&t=term&f=conv&s=created) and I started using Restic shortly after that. When I started, I was only backing up my home folder to the repository over NFS. Now, I'm backing up the entire root filesystem to a repository using the REST backend so I can run Restic as root without breaking the permissions.  I'm working on automating it now and I'm trying to come up with something using pinentry but my proof-of-concept is getting pretty obtuse. It will be spread out in a shell script, of course, but still.  ``` systemd-inhibit --what=handle-lid-switch restic --password-command='su -c "printf '"'"'GETPIN\n\'"'"' | WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 pinentry-qt5 | grep ^D | sed '"'"'s/^D //'"'"'" mckinley' --repository-file /root/restic-repo backup --exclude-file /root/restic-excludes --exclude-caches --one-file-system / ```  I'm curious to see how everyone's backup solutions have changed since last year.
2024-04-21T22:45:35Z	(#nwv3ipq) I wish there was a good GUI for Restic so I could have non-technical people using the same thing I do.
2024-04-21T22:59:19Z	(#nwv3ipq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> How do you manage multiple remotes? Do you just run `restic backup` for each one?
2024-04-22T06:02:36Z	(#7ef2sea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Why do we need to avoid posting to the void? That's pretty much what twtxt was made for. I don't like the "Legacy feed" terminology, either. I support the delisting of ciberlandia.pt but I think this change is heading in a bad direction.  I like @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> 's suggestion. It gives the users the information and lets them make their own decision instead of putting a big scary warning in their face. That's what Microsoft does, and we shouldn't be Microsoft.
2024-04-22T06:08:44Z	(#tztwmua) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Standard twtxt is a microblog in its purest form. A blog, but smaller. It's just a list of posts to read, and that's an echochamber in the same way my regular blog is an echochamber. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I support the delisting of ciberlandia.pt in the Discover feed due to the sheer volume of posts from there and the fact that most of them are in Portuguese with this being a predominantly English-language pod.
2024-04-22T06:18:10Z	(#7ef2sea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think one-way feeds are okay and we shouldn't discourage them so strongly. On the other hand, I think it's the duty of a poderator to filter out feeds that are just noise from the Discover feed. I definitely consider a truckload of one-way posts mostly in another language to be noise. Did you get rid of Gopher Chat too? I'd call that noise, for sure.
2024-04-22T16:45:50Z	(#nwv3ipq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I remember your solution. It's very simple, I like it.   Yes, my backup target is my home server. I have a hard drive dedicated to Restic repositories. It's still not a real backup as I don't have anything offsite but it's better than my previous solution. I had two very old hard drives I kept plugged in to my desktop PC and I would (on very rare occasion) plug in another hard drive and copy all the files over to it. Luckily, I've never suffered any significant data loss and I would rather not start now. Once I have automated backups on each of my machines, the next project is getting those backups offsite.
2024-04-22T16:48:24Z	(#vwbo3aa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Makes sense. We definitely need the ability to mute feeds from the Discover feed.
2024-04-25T04:12:05Z	(#npqalva) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Are they changing unique IDs? I hate when people do that. If I ever do that with any of my feeds, feel free to mock me relentlessly.
2024-04-28T16:05:40Z	(#pjzwjla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Picnic CSS is my favorite one on first glance.
2024-04-28T16:16:55Z	(#iq4rusa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think this would be solved in the short to mid-term by fixing the mute function. Or, maybe, adding a "Hide this user from Discover" button.
2024-04-30T04:47:44Z	(#usfy23q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Both are very nice in my opinion. I don't think you could make a mistake with either, at least when it comes to looks.
2024-05-02T03:21:42Z	(#racbsma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That's good advice. I don't open any ports to the Internet if I can possibly avoid it. Everything is on Wireguard, even stuff that doesn't really need to be. It's super easy to set up on other people's computers, too. Even on Windows.
2024-05-02T03:28:12Z	(#ecjdckq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> I avoid install scripts like the plague. This isn't Windows and they're usually poorly written. I think it's better to prioritize native packages (or at least AUR, MPR, etc) and container images.
2024-05-02T03:34:19Z	(#ecjdckq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I remember running yarnd for testing on a couple of different occasions and both times I found all the required command line options to be annoying. If I remember correctly, running it with missing options would only tell you the first one that was missing and you'd have to keep running it and adding that option before it would work.  This was a couple of years ago, so I don't know if anything's changed since then. It's really not a big problem, because it would be run with some kind of preset command line (systemd service, container entrypoint) in a production environment.
2024-05-02T03:41:24Z	(#lpj45uq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> There's [stagit](https://codemadness.org/git/stagit/file/README.html) which generates static HTML files
2024-05-02T19:24:16Z	(#sdorpga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ZFS is fine but it's out-of-tree and extremely inflexible. If Btrfs RAID5/6 was reliable it would be fantastic. Add and remove drives at will, mix different sizes. I hear it's mostly okay as long as you mirror the metadata (RAID1), scrub frequently, and don't hammer it with too many random reads and writes. However, there are serious performance penalties when running scrubs on the full array and random reads and writes are the entire purpose of a filesystem.  Bcachefs has similar features (but not all of them, like sending/receiving) and it doesn't have the giant scary warnings in the documentation. I hear it's kind of slow and it was only merged into the kernel in version 6.7. I wouldn't really trust it with my data.  I bought a couple more hard drives recently and I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to allocate them before badblocks completes. I have a few days to decide. :)
2024-05-02T19:41:21Z	(#sdorpga) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Exactly. It's just not an option with warnings like that all over the place. Some people have had success, but I'm not risking it. https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/20200627032414.GX10769@hungrycats.org/
2024-05-02T19:51:17Z	(#sdorpga) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Synology uses single-volume Btrfs on software RAID, which seems to be pretty solid in my research but that's less flexible than ZFS. https://kb.synology.com/en-us/DSM/tutorial/What_was_the_RAID_implementation_for_Btrfs_File_System_on_SynologyNAS
2024-05-02T19:51:34Z	(#qmtfzya) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Ha, we both looked it up at once. You win.
2024-05-03T01:49:38Z	QOTD: Have you ever suffered significant data loss? If so, what went wrong?
2024-05-03T02:59:55Z	(#v5mxp7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Planning it ahead of time is all well and good if you have the money to buy 6 or 8 hard drives at once. I really don't, and I want to mirror the whole thing offsite anyway. Mergerfs will let me do it now, and I'll buy a drive each for SnapRAID in short order.
2024-05-03T03:00:41Z	(#gkwcrvq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Fair point... :)
2024-05-03T03:03:16Z	(#kz5qjza) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> Is that a terminal multiplexer? If so, which one? I suspect it says at the top but I can't quite read the text.
