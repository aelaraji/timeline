2017-03-13T07:41:46-05:00	@<mdom https://domgoergen.com/twtxt/mdom.txt> I think we need to focus on giving users better alternatives. I feel that frustration, though.
2017-03-13T12:27:27-05:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> I liked the idea that the reader's client should enforce the length limit.

2017-05-02T13:34:47-05:00	Cooking shows really warp your expectations around the time and effort needed to make something happen.
2017-05-04T10:44:18-05:00	Some pretty cool stuff going on here: https://standardsmanual.com

2017-06-08T16:53:38-05:00	Learning a lot about QMK firmware today.
2017-06-15T14:10:48-05:00	@<freemor http://freemor.homelinux.net:16019/~freemor/twtxt.txt> It's summer in the Northern hemisphere. Everyone is playing outside.

2017-09-03T20:55:10-05:00	It seems that adding Pusheen stickers to a Chromebook will cause it to stop booting. *The more you know...*
2017-09-06T19:34:59-05:00	Does experimenting with LaTeX lead to hardcore PostScript use, or is it the other way around?

2017-09-12T19:54:55.000000Z	I usually tell people to read The Goal by Eli Goldratt. It's weird in a lot of ways, but it really helped me understand the roots of modern agile development process.
2017-09-14T22:16:48.000000Z	I put up my collection of IC documents at davebucklin.com/ic/. Maybe I should add a transfer cap to my AWS account.
2017-09-14T23:24:00.000000Z	@<freemor http://freemor.homelinux.net:16019/~freemor/twtxt.txt> That explains the origin of the names of SDF.org and a certain vaporwave artist.
2017-09-16T16:32:34.000000Z	@<freemor http://freemor.homelinux.net:16019/~freemor/twtxt.txt> Why you gotta say it like that? ;) https://macross82-99.bandcamp.com/
2017-09-18T00:37:52.000000Z	@beniah I like the content and people on here. Isn't twtxt a distributed pub/sub model? Have these problems already been solved?
2017-09-20T00:08:31.000000Z	A short-and-sweet article on principles of successful teams: https://blog.brunomiranda.com/principles-of-successful-software-engineering-teams-41a65bfd56b3

2017-10-01T23:59:26.000000Z	@<freemor http://freemor.homelinux.net:16019/~freemor/twtxt.txt> that takes me back to the RC5-64 project, though my participation in that was intentional.

2017-10-14T15:40:06.000000Z	@<tx https://0x1a4.1337.cx/twtxt.txt> I've heard that cats like novelty when it comes to drinking water.
2017-12-11T13:44:17.000000Z	I've been learning C from the second edition C Programming Language book by Kernighan and Ritchie. Good times.

2018-02-01T04:01:05.000000Z	@<freemor http://freemor.homelinux.net:16019/~freemor/twtxt.txt> I like it. You could optionally segment these lists somehow. It reminds me of how Mastodon instances represent a community of sorts. e.g. weare<something>.txt
2018-03-09T02:20:49.000000Z	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> Proseline reminds me of draftin.com
2018-03-29T22:06:26.000000Z	@<mdosch https://mdosch.de/twtxt.txt> Thank you very cool
2018-04-15T04:12:07.000000Z	Using termux on a 5-inch screen with a graffitti keyboard is a trip. A slow one.

2018-05-19T16:56:15.000000Z	@<skingrapher https://skingrapher.com/t/tw.txt> how is the speed on that? I recently tried a Grafitti kb and, while ergonomic, it was slow.
2018-05-26T23:47:47.000000Z	I'm loving the new CHVRCHES album.

2018-09-27T19:33:38.000000Z	Ever wake up in the morning, pick up your phone, and find a Wikipedia page that you pulled up while you were half-asleep? This morning it was John Candy.
