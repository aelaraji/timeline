2024-01-25T05:46:06-06:00	The temp forecast here for the next 48 hours looks like a straight line. It'll be hovering a few degrees above freezing, day and night, just fluctuating by a degree or two. Odd.
2024-01-26T09:16:51-06:00	Sam Scranton's new album _Body Pillow_ lives up to its name. Giving it a big hug again this morning. #nowplaying
2024-01-27T07:54:40-06:00	Very nice having a working cassette player again. I'm in a virtual jungle of lawnmowers with Coppice's Bypass Ideal tape. #nowplaying
2024-01-27T22:54:00-06:00	Hm, I just realized I probably need to finish the piano roll before I can finish 3walks...

2024-01-29T08:17:37-06:00	Radbound Mens' Three Pieces for Upper Partial Tones is very enjoyable on tape. Ever so slight wow and flutter bubbles nicely onto the surface of the long tones.
2024-01-29T13:52:59-06:00	I've never had a punch-tape style label maker before. This is super fun. Labels for everything!

2024-02-08T16:51:25-06:00	The country music vamp n' talk is a nice format. A stolen-from-the-blues-thing? I like the vibe of someone pouring out their heart into the mic in plain speech while their friends pour their hearts into their instruments gently in the background.
2024-02-08T19:52:08-06:00	It's nice to read [Emma's blog](https://emmas.site).

2024-02-12T11:57:55-06:00	I have a habit of running system updates on my work laptop before going out for coffee. Like some kind of ritual to prepare to go into the world fully patched.

2024-02-15T18:54:39-06:00	the hydrophone is back in the water again! two of them this time. i'm hoping the river will freeze soon. one will stay until the spring and the other will come in and out for me to listen in the meanwhile...
2024-02-17T04:57:59-06:00	The river was frozen for a few weeks this winter (somehow I even saw folks ice fishing at one point) but melted away again pretty fast. [NOAA is saying now it's probably not going to freeze again this year.](https://www.weather.gov/arx/2024_springflood) Wow.
2024-02-17T22:40:51-06:00	This is [a great performance of Scott Lindroth's *Bell Plates*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSO8d3tWjWQ) by Alyssa Resh.
2024-02-18T10:14:31-06:00	Sad to see `moc` removed from the official arch linux repos, but also cool to learn [the debian project has been quietly patching it](https://udd.debian.org/patches.cgi?src=moc&version=1%3A2.6.0~svn-r3005-3.1) and keeping it up to date in recent years. Long live the music on console player. (And debian!) :-)
2024-02-19T07:08:26-06:00	The last entry in my voice memos is a 436 minute mp3 recording documenting a period in the life of my pants pocket.
2024-02-19T14:08:28-06:00	The soundworld of the river in February is pretty different from August. There are so many sloshy water-type sounds right now. I suspect some of it is actually fishes vocalizing. So hard to tell!
2024-02-21T15:35:14-06:00	Today I have a feeling of déjà vu except it's a nightmare and it's happening in real life.
2024-02-23T18:45:06-06:00	Experimenting with going out at night and doing nothing much is a tentative success so far.

2024-01-24T10:27:17-06:00	The Rolling Stones doing Sympathy for the Devil always makes me think of slow panning studio shots interspersed with young people holding machine guns. Good job, Godard.
2024-02-28T10:27:26-06:00	I like it when I'm too distracted to want decide what to play, but there is a tape waiting to be flipped since yesterday.
2024-02-28T16:46:41-06:00	Starting (again) to work on something very old, I discovered it modulates up by a halfstep twice. Up, up, done. Maybe I can work in some extremely slow contrary motion, too.
2024-03-01T07:42:23-06:00	Somewhere I read that changing location, like entering a room, can rejigger neural pathways so that some thoughts and memories are somehow associated with the space. It's the same for me when picking up a laptop. My purpose feels clear until I open a blank web browser window and [my mind goes blank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-dependent_memory#The_outshining_hypothesis), too. In all the moments where I'm drawing a total blank, and then suddenly the thoughts come easily again: maybe that's my brain looking for the room it was in before.
