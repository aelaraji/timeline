2022-06-10T14:03:53Z	@<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> Hello, just getting started with the Android app. Lots to learn here. Will post more as I figure this out, but just wanted to say hello, world.
2022-06-17T14:47:44Z	@<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> (#wbhat6a) just started following. where are you based?
2022-07-01T01:04:16Z	1st world problem: too much yard work to do, to impress family members who will drive here in cars they own, burning $5 gas,  so we can eat plentiful grilled meat, to celebrate a country that is arguably not being invaded by Russia.
2022-11-30T14:12:41Z	Any USMNT fans?  Quite a relief to see them get squeak past Iran yesterday.
2022-12-04T03:41:25Z	Michigan finally taking it to Purdue. If they want to stay #<2 https://twtxt.net/search?tag=2>, better win this by 40 points.
2022-12-10T19:21:18Z	Great day for ice fishing in Minnesota. ![](https://imgur.com/a/pit090Q)
2022-12-10T23:52:35Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#qf5eudq) Yes it wasn't first attempt. From my phone I couldnt get my hands on the url with the file name. Maybe there's a better service to use.
2022-12-11T00:09:13Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#qf5eudq) I posted (and am posting at the moment) with Goryon
2022-12-17T14:53:44Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#35oynwa) Sounds like you have a little coder on your hands. I tried starting my boys like that, but they prefer that others write the code.
2022-12-17T15:15:08Z	(#dyqcq2q) Not for me. it's there till spring. trying to remove it would destroy my gutters.
2022-12-31T23:23:42Z	Happy New Year all. May 2023 bring you blessings and prosperity.
2023-03-08T00:29:02Z	Watched, "Everything Everywhere All At Once." wow, what a ride. Highly recommend. This should win Best Picture.
2023-03-12T22:09:43Z	Ok, I'll admit it. I'm tired of snow. I've done all my favorite winter activities.  Now I am ready to cut grass. This latest snow storm just wiped me out.
2023-03-22T17:16:11Z	Another 4 inches of snow last night.  I'm in the market for warmer climes.
2023-03-23T01:14:50Z	@<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> (#t2nex3q) I wouldn't put my name on AI generated text. God knows where those words have been. You think you've saved time then suddenly you're being harassed by DMCA take down letters, or worse.
2023-03-24T16:54:25Z	Didn't watch all 5 hours of the TikTok hearings but what I did see was a bunch of boomers asking dumb embarrass staff prepared, technically-nonsensical boomeresque questions like "Does it connect to the Wi-Fi?" and "Why have you not directed your engineers to change the source code?"  I hate TikTok but I hate stupid political shit like this even more. Even when it is "bi-partisan."
2023-04-18T19:35:38Z	You know that thing when a resting dog gets up and turns little circles before laying back down comfortably?  That's my iRobot today.  Do you think she might be a little sick, or just content?
2023-05-07T21:37:55Z	@<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> (#5pwcfqa) You just described my tinnitus.
2023-05-09T11:40:01Z	@niplav (#oq42zzq) Is there a practical difference in meaning that I have not known about my entire life?  $$$
2023-05-09T11:47:42Z	@@villares@ciberlandia.pt (#csldnxa) Fedilab client has a built in translator. its. become my favorite client for usin ng fediverse platforms.
2023-06-20T19:11:44Z	@<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> (#ossergq) Yes, Twitter is disgusting.
2023-11-11T22:10:28Z	Deer hunting opened last week. thought I'd try to share a pic here.  ![](https://www.amazon.com/photos/shared/2JuffnUuSUqhB9d4eBqb-A.0XQ_Gjk-WV_VCwAdiXH9NK/gallery/4PpVkflxTWWv_fTXTLgl_g)
2023-11-13T18:24:44Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#wo5dzsa) Did it work? Gorgon doesn't display the pic in my feed.
2023-11-17T12:22:56Z	I'm chheckin in here after being away for a bit. Glad to see new-to-me people, just followed a bunch. I like what's being built here.  I am most active on Mastodon, https://c.im/@darren  but would like to step up activity here, too. For ppl who post here on Android with Gorgon, which file host service do you use?
2023-11-18T13:15:59Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#wo5dzsa) Thank you, much appreciated.
2023-11-18T13:18:22Z	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#wo5dzsa) No, we saw a bunch, but I guess I was too picky and wound up with nothing this year. The does were everywhere.  This was north of Duluth, Minnesota.
2023-11-19T09:40:13Z	@<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> (#rg3d75q) I don't recall that symptom. The worst part for me was losing smell. I bought a scent kit to retrain, and it eventually came back.But 2 years later, I still occasionally get a phantom smell that resembles burnt rubber.
2023-11-19T09:44:19Z	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#wo5dzsa) Rifle season has ended, but bow and black powder seasons continue.  Yes its important to check the regs every year, they are always changing.
2023-11-20T11:49:31Z	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#wo5dzsa) I assume the success rate is lower with a bow and low power weapons, so they extend the season. Its probably also safer to divide the seasons.
2023-12-23T18:10:08Z	Let me begin my war on Christmas by wishing you all Happy Holidays!
2023-12-30T01:29:37Z	Took this during our ice storm 3 days ago.  ![](https://www.amazon.com/photos/shared/ibQmB0-qQteKK8RRrjAxaQ.-V8qFCGcw5F1-0WmE0ydtp)
2024-01-01T05:08:15Z	Happy New Year, peeps!
2024-01-21T19:30:24Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#hgwe26q) That will be a nice upgrade! Congrats.
2024-01-22T01:17:03Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#qqquveq) I totally agree.  Our work in aggregate is a competive advantage. We have been subject to medieval punishment for copying a fkng song. But OpenAi should be allowed to suck up all our work and derive value from it... for free??
2024-02-22T03:33:56Z	Today in NW Minnesota, its 52 degrees. In February. We are on track for the warmest winter on record. Its been disappointing not to be able to avail ourselves of all the winter activities and outdoor sports we typically enjoy. Instead, I am worrying about deer ticks in February. Wtf. Next week with temps that could reach the 60s, I will probably get a jump on spring cleanup (which usually happens here in May), with the lawn tractor.
2024-04-16T01:36:40Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#2hmj7aq) XMR has all but replaced Bitcoin on the dark web.
