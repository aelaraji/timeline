2023-03-04T00:54:33Z	Hello world
2023-03-04T00:54:50Z	(#zswuvaa) just setting up my twtxt
2023-03-06T23:36:29Z	(#zswuvaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hi! Thanks :) This seems fun!
2023-03-06T23:37:57Z	(#wcgaqkq) Haha thank you! :)
2023-03-06T23:48:20Z	Wait, does yarn.social support ActivityPub?
2023-03-07T01:48:07Z	@<rabble https://twtxt.net/user/rabble/twtxt.txt> on yarn.social too, wow! I've met you already on Mastodon and nostr... this is great.
2023-03-07T01:51:14Z	(#e5dvpma) replying to you from my yarn account - that was just me messing with hosting my own twtxt file on GitHub pages with the original twtxt client. I'll probably use yarn more often though...
2023-03-07T03:08:45Z	(#v6aozua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> that is so cool.
2023-03-07T03:43:19Z	(#v6aozua) Sadly I don't have much technical expertise :( but I can help with anything that doesn't require programming
2023-03-07T04:07:25Z	(#v6aozua) sure! happy to help.
2023-03-07T23:54:45Z	(#v6aozua) How do I contribute?
2023-03-11T23:44:19Z	(#v6aozua) not sure tbh.. also sorry for ghosting you for a 3 days :)
2023-03-11T23:47:41Z	(#nrp4ywq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> personally I think it should be there at user level for sure - that way ActivityPub-averse yarn users can join any pod and then decide for themselves whether they want ActivityPub or not, without requiring a pod owner to turn it off for everyone in the pod.
2023-03-13T22:24:21Z	(#v6aozua) plain and ordinary is cool üëç I will check it out and try
2023-03-15T04:03:54Z	Happy œÄ day
2023-03-15T04:07:07Z	(#ocbcqta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what do you think could help make it more decentralized?
2023-03-22T16:08:17Z	(#ocbcqta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Check out GNU Taler. It meets at least some of those goals :)
2023-03-28T03:22:45Z	(#55bjtha) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®‚Ä®Thank you! That's really useful.
2023-04-04T03:44:51Z	https://mstdn.social/@maxkennerly/110135002996685641
2023-04-04T05:45:24Z	(#r47kuyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ah thanks for doing that, forgot to do it myself. I'll remember next time üôÇ
2023-04-04T22:37:40Z	(#r47kuyq) @<screem https://twtxt.net/user/screem/twtxt.txt> Exactly, this kind of double standard is just plain stupid.
2023-04-07T02:14:35Z	(#taiqxpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> To be honest I find it pretty funny... just why the Bitcoin whitepaper? And what's with the other image in the same directory?‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm not anti-Bitcoin or pro-Bitcoin, it's just an _interesting_ choice
2023-04-07T02:45:32Z	(#65pchpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> how do you do that? sounds interesting.
2023-04-08T20:22:26Z	(#55bjtha) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> sorry not sure how to install it, downloading the zip didn't work for some reason
2023-04-11T04:15:48Z	(#s6rhqra) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ooh that's pretty cool
2023-04-12T02:24:51Z	twtxt is like social media but unix philosophy ü§Ø
2023-04-15T04:46:14Z	(#rsviqoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yep that's exactly what I meant
2023-04-15T04:56:07Z	(#55bjtha) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Ah thanks! Hooray, it worked!‚Ä®‚Ä®https://shreyanjain.net/twtxt
2023-04-16T05:37:39Z	(#gjst6xa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Honestly this is quite disappointing to see as someone new to the twtxt/yarn ecosystem - it feels like the entirety of the buckket argument is based on a "purist" viewpoint when nothing yarn does feels fundamentally incompatible with original twtxt ‚Ä®‚Ä®Very sad üòî ‚Ä®‚Ä®However I do agree with jan6 on that while yarn is a great twtxt client, twtxt is a terrible yarn client ‚Ä®‚Ä®That doesn't mean that yarn should change its underlying format away from twtxt though, twtxt is probably yarn's biggest selling point ‚Ä®‚Ä®my view of twxt is essentially a feed of arbitrary plain text data with timestamps, which can open up the ecosystem to all sorts of good experimentation in clients‚Ä®‚Ä®and for the specific case of multiline twts, when you actively have a pr waiting which addresses the issue, the stubbornness of the opposition seems quite unreasonable ‚Ä®‚Ä®that's just my two cents, didn't mean to write a paragraph (lol a multiline twt for you right here)
2023-04-17T01:10:58Z	In 2021 the next big thing in tech were craptocurrencies and shitcoins. Now it's LLMs (lying language models).‚Ä®‚Ä®What's next?
2023-04-17T20:03:05Z	(#eovso7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Pretty amazing how unprepared that guy went in
2023-04-17T23:19:23Z	(#eiv2qka) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I also feel it's not well maintained, when I tried to use it a lot of things felt pretty broken - no public nick, config not in the twtxt.txt, following list stored separately, etc...‚Ä®‚Ä®might even be best to just create a fork
2023-04-17T23:21:40Z	(#ftvuumq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What on earth does "cloud native" even mean? What is the cloud but someone else's server?
2023-04-21T01:52:49Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> get well soon! The COVID virus is a tough one
2023-04-22T00:30:19Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> is gonna be so mad at me for this but‚Ä®‚Ä®Ruby is my favorite language

2023-05-03T05:44:48Z	(#m37icwa) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> I have a few invite codes. Message me on matrix as shreyanjain:matrix.org or email me shreyan.jain.9@outlook.com ‚Ä®‚Ä®XRPC is pretty neat but yeah until federation hits it's a little iffy‚Ä®‚Ä®You can 100% host your own right now, but federation lands sometime next month
2023-05-03T16:52:28Z	(#fghhzwa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I'm on BlueSky. This isn't the case. Such accounts were banned within 7 minutes of reporting them. Federation is their top priority right now - it was just delayed by the sudden influx of users, which caused them to have to focus much more strongly on moderation.

2023-05-07T08:46:09Z	(#n2yrn6q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah. While I strongly dislike Jordan Peterson et al I would like to someday discuss some of these controversial things with you and others while not getting too heated.
2023-05-07T08:47:31Z	Maybe I did this just to get on @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>'s nerves, but: https://codeberg.org/shreyan/twtxt
2023-05-08T23:39:47Z	Hello from Ruby
2023-05-09T02:28:59Z	Dang this Yarn API is good
2023-05-09T04:49:23Z	(#pg5dg7q) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> That "lonely men bait" is quite possibly the most absurdist-seeming thing on this list.
2023-05-09T16:53:19Z	(#rt3ekma) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I would agree, but it feels like GPT already does that. :)
2023-05-09T16:55:07Z	(#rt3ekma) Indubitably, it would be an intellectually stimulating and intellectually invigorating exercise to endeavor to craft a prose devoid of any substantive idea or notion. To partake in such a linguistic activity, one must embrace the aphorism that the beauty of language lies not in its utilitarian function but rather in the aesthetic pleasure of its form. The pursuit of such an objective requires a mastery of language that transcends the pedestrian concerns of conveying meaning and instead focuses on the artful arrangement of words and phrases into a mosaic of syntactical structure. One must be cautious, however, not to fall into the trap of mistaking verbal acrobatics for genuine intellectual profundity. For while it may be entertaining to indulge in a linguistic parlor game, it is ultimately through the substantive and coherent expression of ideas that we achieve true intellectual enlightenment.
2023-05-09T21:44:40Z	(#ydoiv5q) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> What's your budget?

2023-05-10T16:16:15Z	(#5bl6sta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Oh wow, I hadn't heard of Vircadia before. This looks really cool.‚Ä®‚Ä®Also. The idea of Augmented Reality is much more appealling to me than full Virtual Reality. And a pair of glasses is a lot easier to wear than a headset.
2023-05-11T04:38:16Z	What if I implement twtxt or a yarn client in Elixir üò≥
2023-05-11T15:41:58Z	(#d7vpcza) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> The funny thing is that while there are many things wrong with the AT Protocol, almost none of them are what he described
2023-05-12T02:39:29Z	Posting this from Elixir

2023-05-15T05:38:30Z	(#kcf4vrq) God forbid I say that at first glance it might even look like a much more complicated twtxt???
2023-05-18T04:55:15Z	I truly despise the way Apple has slowly locked up macOS
2023-05-19T05:43:21Z	(#vdbrbha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's also been my primary OS for a long time, and I still love it, but I don't love some of Apple's decisions. What prompted me to write this specific post was having to take extra steps to open FOSS apps on macOS because they don't have an "Apple-approved" signature ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2023-05-19T17:02:11Z	https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2013/09/16/how-aaron-swartz-the-irresistible-force-and-ron-wyden-and-darrell-issa-the-immovable-object-saved-the-internet-part-ii/‚Ä®‚Ä®I find it deeply ironic that the site that ran this article, Forbes, has by now become enshittified with ads and paywall popups galore. Would they come out against stricter copyright laws again today?
2023-05-20T05:10:14Z	(#ux3bs2q) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> What about Ulysses?
2023-05-21T06:57:52Z	(#vdbrbha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> True, `brew` is very helpful in that regards, and yeah, security does matter. It just bothers me when they use such logic to, for example, restrict Safari WebExtensions to only being available through the App Store even if it's signed properly
2023-05-22T19:29:12Z	(#vdbrbha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I hope so. If there is, I haven't found it yet

2023-06-07T22:55:27Z	(#nwucftq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> for sure, the thought of being able to buy one does not even really cross my mind
2023-06-08T15:07:00Z	(#aere2za) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>  if the death threats are coming from Microsoft themselves that's a whole other can of worms, and I really hope it's not them. and if they aren't then who are these people who care so much about copilot they're willing to resort to others' deaths to keep it? the whole thing is very strange and horrifying.
2023-06-13T02:59:01Z	what's wrong with this headline? ü§îüßê‚Ä®‚Ä®![](https://twtxt.net/media/kNiR9jybEk9CPFsEUBwrbB.png)

2023-06-13T16:30:58Z	(#r7c56vq) the new headline isn't that much better. why is 'generational' in quotation marks? it just feels so silly üòî
2023-06-14T03:27:58Z	(#ructfwa) @<prologic https://neotxt.dk/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> personally loving Orion browser. so few left who don't pull BS like this

2023-08-13T04:40:11Z	(#ee63oea) Another thing I noticed - the Python implementation cannot handle 512-bit keys. Not sure if this is a limitation of the library or of BIP-39 itself.

2023-08-26T22:28:58Z	Taking a look at the [V Programming Language](https://vlang.io)
2023-08-27T02:52:54Z	Check out the [Nex Protocol](https://nightfall.city/nex/). It's designed to be even simpler than Gemini and Gopher. What do you think? Could be great to host a twtxt feed on.

2023-08-28T17:25:23Z	(#mfvalvq) My Go implementation of a server, for the curious: https://github.com/ShreyanJain9/nex-server

2023-08-31T15:16:20Z	(#ij6gpnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Last night's supermoon, I think
2023-09-19T05:45:05Z	(#ctloqvq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> very nice
2023-09-21T01:03:36Z	https://xeiaso.net/blog/gokrazy‚Ä®‚Ä®Check this out
2023-09-21T17:58:54Z	(#vs7s7ta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Even stupider considering that Google Authenticator is what they advertise as the main 2FA method *for your google account*. Now think about how that works when the authentication code for your account is being synced, *in your account*...
2023-09-26T23:00:52Z	Posting from Yarnc!
2023-09-27T02:38:58Z	(#4rioria) @<prologic https://neotxt.dk/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  indeed. I'm also trying to see if I can index all of twtxt (in a mix of Ruby and Go, haha) üòÜ
2023-09-27T23:51:23Z	(#4rioria) @<prologic https://neotxt.dk/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  yes haha, I'm using your stats to track completion. I also want to try some stupid things with it
2023-09-27T16:54:21-07:00	Testing yarn's sync function
2023-10-13T23:10:20Z	(#agjpbta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Quick question, does this mean you need to put the entirety of file contents in the URL? Why not instead put it in the POST request body?
2023-10-14T22:04:42Z	(#agjpbta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ah, thanks üôÇ, I wasn't sure
2023-10-20T01:15:02Z	(#b7srh4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> there is also an adblocker rule you can use to get rid of it:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®youtube.com##+js(set, yt.config_.openPopupConfig.supportedPopups.adBlockMessageViewModel, false)‚Ä®youtube.com##+js(set, Object.prototype.adBlocksFound, 0)‚Ä®youtube.com##+js(set, ytplayer.config.args.raw_player_response.adPlacements, [])‚Ä®youtube.com##+js(set, Object.prototype.hasAllowedInstreamAd, true)‚Ä®```
2023-10-21T21:06:03Z	(#b7srh4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> They have a [help center article](https://helpcenter.getadblock.com/hc/en-us/articles/9738501334035-How-to-use-custom-filters) about it - hope you're not using Safari...
2023-10-27T23:07:00Z	(#myx5gpq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ewwww
2023-11-05T17:37:49Z	Installing Haiku
2023-11-05T20:47:23Z	(#uapibtq) so, the installation went well, but I cannot figure out how to boot from the drive now
2023-11-23T02:15:26Z	(#wjky32a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I mean, at least there is a solution! Ideally though, this problem wouldn't exist in the first place; it's completely manufactured by all the sites trying to use cookies in harmful ways, lol
2023-11-23T02:16:45Z	OpenAI drama has been VERY weird. Betting that Altman is fired within a week again :0
2023-12-02T22:14:15Z	joining the twtxt aoc leaderboard..
2023-12-03T06:46:39Z	(#7whe4xa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> now i just need to actually start solving the problems lol
2023-12-04T02:22:49Z	literally cannot get past day one. what's the trick?
2023-12-06T05:07:24Z	(#u3exsfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Are word forms of digits supposed to be parsed as digits? I even did that and it still doesn't work
2023-12-15T00:26:47Z	Lost motivation for AoC. Lol.
2023-12-28T04:54:55Z	hmm all my old twts disappeared from the yarn webview, is that normal?
2024-01-01T19:32:23Z	Happy New Year!!!
2024-01-06T21:14:17Z	@<jan6 https://twtxt.net/user/jan6/twtxt.txt> it's your day!
2024-01-11T20:26:17Z	(#mznq45q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm fairly unimpressed with the actual product. The problem they're solving is real, but I don't think the way they're trying to solve it is correct.
2024-01-27T17:54:32Z	Oh no, I forgot to post this here three days ago! Here you go now:‚Ä®‚Ä®https://shreyanjain.net/2024/01/24/years-ago-today.html
2024-01-27T22:34:00Z	(#s5zyc6a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The one that shipped with the original Mac looked somewhat different:‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/QFx7oeidrSxfg7Eruxvu9J.png) ‚Ä®‚Ä®But the one in my post is the most famous/recognizable version, as it appeared in some of the later versions. Stephen Hackett documented [a lot of its history](https://512pixels.net/dogcow/) very well...
2024-01-29T04:01:21Z	So I assume nobody here will be buying a Vision Pro?
2024-02-02T06:11:43Z	(#rkc3iqa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I know right!
2024-02-02T06:12:15Z	(#ankvkia) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Interesting! I think Spatial Computing will be exciting, if they've done it well.
2024-02-03T17:38:18Z	(#g52ndpq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> seems like a good idea
2024-02-11T18:43:21Z	(#nxkzjiq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> The worst of Silicon Valley summed up in a nutshell, lol.
2024-02-12T05:56:05Z	(#ankvkia) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Lol! I'm implying that Twtxt users are too wise to buy a new hyped product
2024-02-16T00:28:13Z	What would the reaction here be if Twtxt were to be added to Bridgy Fed?
2024-02-16T21:19:34Z	(#hzujuvq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The only GPT I recognize is the GUID Partition Table
2024-02-19T19:50:20Z	(#mnpnvda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yes please, my default way of storing Twtxt usernames right now is as a URL, but I think Webfinger would be nice as well
2024-02-26T05:00:28Z	Wanna see something interesting?‚Ä®‚Ä®https://github.com/ovnanova/hexpds
2024-02-27T03:35:17Z	(#otuupfq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Nothing *that* cool, just happen to be working on it and it's an Elixir-based Personal Data Server for Bluesky/AT Protocol
2024-03-01T05:37:43Z	yarn should define its own federation protocol that extends the basic twtxt in ways that twtxt doesn't allow. it's time. and i've got ideas!
2024-03-02T18:43:59Z	(#7uxy6nq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I know yarn is culturally a slower place than most mainstream social, but I would like to enable servers to somewhat "broadcast" new events on some subscribable endpoint. Since much of the network relies on indexers, this would help the indexers get new posts more immediately, rather than having to schedule their crawls. That's just one idea to start with
2024-03-03T01:25:03Z	(#7uxy6nq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Cool! Now what might be useful is to take all the cool things Yarn does and spec them out into a full protocol. This is also where we might get into extending beyond what Twtxt can offer and into a yarn-specific spec.
2024-03-03T23:51:11Z	How is everyone?
2024-03-10T20:22:13Z	(#dpa3swq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Oh Chimera is the one using BSD userland?? Found that very interesting when I saw it a while back
2024-03-21T22:57:15Z	(#hnjfvrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I hope it kills the company
2024-03-26T23:23:53Z	Hello! How is everyone?
2024-04-03T01:12:15Z	I have decided to make Go good
2024-04-06T21:12:12Z	(#pcy4raq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It has been done https://github.com/ShreyanJain9/result
2024-04-06T21:12:23Z	Prolog is pretty neat
2024-04-08T04:16:17Z	I wanted to see if anybody had made a Gopher library for Go(lang) and turns out, I know the guy who did üòÇ @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>‚Ä®‚Ä®Referring, of course, to https://git.mills.io/prologic/go-gopher
2024-04-09T01:34:48Z	(#f3fjk3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Nice!
2024-04-11T17:08:48Z	Windows is such an awful OS nowadays
2024-04-12T01:45:26Z	I am going to make a library to add Monads to Go and call it Gonads
2024-04-13T20:10:59Z	(#cylt4ca) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Just a Monoid in the category of Endofunctors, what's the problem?
2024-04-13T20:11:38Z	Bitwarden is truly excellent. Highly recommend
2024-04-28T18:15:22Z	(#gxolr6a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Niche I think. Not a bad thing!
