2020-11-28T06:22:13Z	hello, world
2020-11-28T12:38:56Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<bsqmcqq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=bsqmcqq>) Thanks, glad to be here! Cool project!
2020-11-28T13:08:41Z	I think the crowd here would also be interested in my static site generator https://mkws.sh/!
2020-11-28T16:50:32Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<yg3xs2q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=yg3xs2q>) Alcohol is not a problem, alcohol is a (chemical) solution.
2020-11-29T08:07:08Z	(#<74ymzza https://twtxt.net/search?tag=74ymzza>) Thanks! Go ahead! It's also packaged in Void Linux https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/7acd21b605b2c418011657cd49a89568e2b39bc4/srcpkgs/pp/template.
2020-11-29T08:56:04Z	(#<74ymzza https://twtxt.net/search?tag=74ymzza>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<74ymzza https://twtxt.net/search?tag=74ymzza>) `pp(1)` compiles cleanly, `lts(5)` gives a `tcc: error: Unknown relocation type: 23` error.
2020-11-29T09:00:17Z	(#<74ymzza https://twtxt.net/search?tag=74ymzza>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> You can get away by not linking statically.
2020-11-29T23:33:17Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<dzxnjcq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=dzxnjcq>) How many people in total on this pod?
2020-11-30T20:26:53Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<odglxqq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=odglxqq>) Almost bed time for me! :P
2020-11-30T20:56:13Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<odglxqq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=odglxqq>) Romania. :) It's 23:00 here.
2020-11-30T21:40:20Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Who designed your https://jointwt.org/ landing page?
2020-11-30T22:09:42Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<antonio https://twtxt.net/user/antonio/twtxt.txt> (#<mxzusta https://twtxt.net/search?tag=mxzusta>) I was thinking to exchange some development for some design on my static site generator's website https://mkws.sh/ and asking around, and tbh, I was thinking of migrating your website to my solution to see how it fits because it looks like a good candidate but I postponed it because I got a headache from clicking "View Source" and didn't know if it would be well received. Maybe I'm old school, but I still prefer semantic selectors in my CSS.
2020-12-01T11:16:09Z	(#<arp4gzq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=arp4gzq>) I've been recently binge watching Fool Us https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fool+us.
2020-12-01T12:13:45Z	(#<arp4gzq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=arp4gzq>) Yeah, I was captivated by it! :D
2020-12-02T07:40:32Z	@<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<nfwt72a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=nfwt72a>) I remember ordering McDonald's for the first time a few years ago. Doesn't taste so good... Not lovin' it.
2020-12-02T07:44:31Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<qqgzqfa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=qqgzqfa>) `git` is a monopoly!
2020-12-02T08:08:38Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (#<nfwt72a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=nfwt72a>) I'm talking about ordered McDonald's specifically, it gets soggy on the way.
2020-12-02T12:02:45Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think optional self hosting and selling optional hosted services is the future of the web. https://sourcehut.org/ has a similiar business model.
2020-12-02T12:19:54Z	(#<2yw2goq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=2yw2goq>) Yeah, I understood that, that's why I wrote that. You "just need" to also acquire customers and sell. üòõ What's your target, technical people?
2020-12-02T12:48:41Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<2yw2goq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=2yw2goq>) It's not easy to sell, especially to anyone and everyone.
2020-12-02T13:22:35Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<2yw2goq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=2yw2goq>) Not that I'm great at sales. üòÅ
2020-12-02T14:11:54Z	(#<2yw2goq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=2yw2goq>) It's a reasonable price, but you got that right, people only recently started becoming "privacy aware", wouldn't be the first time I recommended people to switch to to "better" tech, but I personally, would probably host my own pod for nothing except the hosting costs.
2020-12-02T20:33:07Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I took a closer look at https://github.com/prologic/uLinux, pretty cool, although I prefer https://core.suckless.org/sbase/ to busybox but I guess sbase is imature? Is this https://github.com/prologic/ulinux.org what's on https://ulinux.org/?
2020-12-02T20:52:00Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<2yw2goq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=2yw2goq>) World is not ideal! üòõ
2020-12-02T20:56:16Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<ml5zfua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ml5zfua>) What's wrong with the website?
2020-12-02T20:59:31Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<ml5zfua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ml5zfua>) What's wrong with the website, sorry, I edited my twt, you said you need to fix it? üòõ
2020-12-02T21:11:17Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<ml5zfua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ml5zfua>) Is this the source code https://github.com/prologic/ulinux.org?
2020-12-02T21:19:04Z	I'm crying a little bit inside, why would you use bootstrap to develop this? https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-researcher/ üòî
2020-12-02T21:30:25Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<ml5zfua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ml5zfua>) So that's what's wrong with it. üòõ What kind of laziness? üòõ I might take a shot a writing it with `mkws(1)`. üòõ
2020-12-02T21:39:40Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<x677apa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=x677apa>) The original is pretty clean https://ankitsultana.com/researcher/, what a bad port...
2020-12-02T21:45:57Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<ml5zfua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ml5zfua>) So do I use this version https://github.com/prologic/ulinux.org?
2020-12-02T21:49:08Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<ml5zfua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ml5zfua>) Cool!
2020-12-02T22:21:49Z	@<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<ml5zfua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ml5zfua>) I don't think https://github.com/prologic/ulinux.org is complete, there are some menu items that don't have any pages like Documentation, Downloads, Packages, Ports? I think that's why there's a different version on http://ulinux.org/?
2020-12-02T22:28:00Z	This is pretty cool for live reloading https://livejs.com/, no `npm`, just drop in the script.
2020-12-02T22:39:56Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<ml5zfua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ml5zfua>) So I can just leave the links as they are?
2020-12-02T23:16:21Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<ml5zfua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ml5zfua>) But then you moved to GitHub pages because you didn't want to sync the README. üòõ I guess you could just fetch it when generating.
2020-12-03T18:01:42Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Does `ulinux` have `wget(1)`?
2020-12-04T09:08:07Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Did some work on https://ulinux.org website, do you think something like this would work https://file.io/23ohDS3bExeH?
2020-12-04T09:14:06Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<y7fshfa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=y7fshfa>) https://file.io/Cgp54amxhwVy
2020-12-04T09:18:13Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<y7fshfa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=y7fshfa>) Click "Download File"?
2020-12-04T09:23:56Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<y7fshfa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=y7fshfa>) Didn't want to host it in git yet, haha, hence the file, but I will, take a look at `./bin/mkws` and `./index.upphtml`, what do you think?
2020-12-04T09:28:44Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<y7fshfa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=y7fshfa>) https://github.com/adriangrigore/myulinux.org
2020-12-04T09:33:12Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<y7fshfa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=y7fshfa>) So you're fine with fetching stuff via `wget(1)`?
2020-12-04T09:52:11Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<y7fshfa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=y7fshfa>) Yup!
2020-12-04T15:29:23Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Can you show me the static files under 'Documentation', 'Downloads' etc...? I'd prefer to remove the https://purecss.io/ dependency, do they depend on it?
2020-12-04T15:35:02Z	Pretty cool tool https://github.com/client9/csstool !
2020-12-04T20:40:53Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<q33p37q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=q33p37q>) Cool! I prefer keeping the look & feel but without Pure.css.
2020-12-04T20:43:17Z	(#<r7ihflq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=r7ihflq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yup, also found these which are pretty cool https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/ .
2020-12-04T20:45:17Z	(#<r7ihflq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=r7ihflq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Also, this https://github.com/ericchiang/pup .

2020-12-05T11:16:45Z	(#<nb6nkoa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=nb6nkoa>) @<markwylde https://twtxt.net/user/markwylde/twtxt.txt> I would like to see OpenBSD on RISC-V and also an open GPU and then my preferred hardware and software stack would be complete. Add Plan9 as a bonus.
2020-12-05T23:43:07Z	(#<qh2d56q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=qh2d56q>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I forgot to ask, which shot hit the tree, 1st, 2nd or 3rd?
2020-12-06T11:55:48Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What about that "About" link on the ulinux.org website?

2020-12-07T10:02:50Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<aypjweq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=aypjweq>) And RSS? That would be for Posts?
2020-12-07T12:52:26Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<aypjweq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=aypjweq>) We'll have to do some minor editing to the README. https://github.com/karlb/smu can't handle those `[X]`'s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prologic/ulinux/master/README.md.
2020-12-07T21:17:24Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<uqzcwxa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=uqzcwxa>) Not bad! 1k growth in a month also!
2020-12-07T21:59:42Z	(#<uqzcwxa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=uqzcwxa>) I don't think it's 5000 uniques!
2020-12-08T10:30:55Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What do you think of this https://github.com/adriangrigore/myulinux.org? Look at https://github.com/adriangrigore/myulinux.org/blob/main/share/l.upphtml and https://github.com/adriangrigore/myulinux.org/blob/main/share/s.uppcss.

2020-12-08T12:48:16Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Why can't I see your replies in this conversation? https://twtxt.net/search?tag=74ymzza
2020-12-08T14:06:09Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<lyxal https://twtxt.net/user/lyxal/twtxt.txt> (#<tbcxz5a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tbcxz5a>) Not a big fan of deploying inside a container, I think it may hide unresolved portability issues and leads to less robust code? Prefer to deploy to "bare metal"?

2021-01-18T05:51:45Z	I believe `git` is overkill for most software projects. It was developed specifically for the Linux kernel which had 27.8 million lines of code at the start of 2020. https://www.linux.com/news/linux-in-2020-27-8-million-lines-of-code-in-the-kernel-1-3-million-in-systemd/

One security measure along chrooting is disallowing overwriting of already present `ENV` variables. Any other idea?

2021-01-23T12:45:28Z	For `mkws` I'm considering dropping version control completely as it's so small and I believe it's a good idea to send the message that you don't necessary need version control, but it's a good idea to be present on GitHub. What do you think?

On OpenBSD I run `cwm` as a window manager which can be customized to look pretty cool. Both Void Linux and OpenBSD can run GNOME. I used `dwm` and `spectrwm` also for a while. I had some problems with packages on Void Linux, not impossible to solve but if I you'd like more packages probably I'd go with Arch but there's some tinkering there also. For less tinkering, I'd probably go with Manjaro.

Yes, shell script fits the bill pretty well. One if its core strengths are working with the filesystem and working with plain text. Web sites are just files from the file system served by a web server, what better tool to work with the file system then shell. Also HTML is text, again good tool for the job. I understand its structured and a parser is better for complicated stuff but for simple stuff shell script is enough. Fits the worse is better philosophy pretty well also.‚Ä®‚Ä®I tend to see `pp` as scriptable plain text.

2021-02-07T09:37:47Z	(#<kzo5h7q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=kzo5h7q>) The alternative is what Hugo does, a single binary and having the static site as "source code" which Hugo compiles, but I believe the idea of customizing the main mkws script is really nice, I'm replacing config files with just scripting your generator, updating may be a problem but there's not much to update there anyway.

I _personally_ believe all tiny scripts there are at least decent, I believe the linters are nice and the log analytics scripts are nice although, both of them may be rewritten in C even tho `awk` fits so well for the log analytics. And `default.css` is nice. I've incorporated the linters in my `mkws` build process.

The security issue lays in overwriting any other variable already present in the global scope.

2021-02-17T23:21:18Z	(#<qrq326q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=qrq326q>) The reason I rarely use 2-3-4 SPAs is because they hog my computer. I put 2 more there just in case I forgot any. I don't believe buying better hardware that still hogs is an option.
2021-02-17T23:22:40Z	(#<qrq326q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=qrq326q>) From my experience SPAs hog on any computer!

Also, as you may have noticed I don't believe in hard "shoulds" or "shouldn'ts", but more on "it would be better to", "it would be a good idea to", "it's preferable to", this way, things are more relaxed.

2021-03-03T11:44:58Z	The recommended way to distribute dependencies with your `mkws` websites is to bundle them as static binaries so you don't have to run any package manager on the server side either. So, if your website uses `smu`, distribute a statically compiled `smu` in your website's `./bin` directory. The recommended way of doing this is to do a `make install PREFIX=/path/to/mkws/website/root`. Make sure the `-static` flag is set. That way you will also get the `man` pages installed in the `./share/man` directory.
2021-03-03T17:30:53Z	I'm getting lots of `404 page not found`, what's the deal?

2021-03-04T10:05:55Z	For compiling `mkws`'s binaries on OpenBSD and Linux I run a set of commands via `ssh`, create a binary archive, pipe it to `uuencode` on the remote server and pipe it back to `uudecode` locally. Great use case for `uuencode` and `uudecode` pair.

There are also other static site generators who deliver a single static executable, `hugo`, `zola`, [`saait`](https://git.codemadness.org/saait/file/README.html).

Makes sense to call `pp $anotherfile` than `singlebinary render $anotherfile` I guess.

2021-03-05T08:32:20Z	When calling `$ /bin/sh -c "$(cat foo); foo"`, the `$(cat foo)` part is evaluated in the outer `sh` process, so the actual argument your `sh` invocation is getting is:‚Ä®```‚Ä®$ /bin/sh -c "foo() {‚Ä®       printf "Hello World"‚Ä®}; foo"‚Ä®```‚Ä®You have the function definition there and the call which works.‚Ä®When calling `$ /bin/sh -c '$(cat foo); foo'`, the `$(cat foo)` part is evaluated in your `sh` process, so what's actually happening is `$(cat foo)`  is trying to interpret the first "command" from the `foo` file, `foo()` which is obviously `not found`.

Then it goes to the `foo` function call which is also not found because again there's no `foo` command anywhere, because the function definition wasn't parsed correctly earlier as preferred.

2021-09-27T10:12:51Z	@<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Are these `_copy` files just backups? Generally speaking, it's not recommended to store backups in a `git` repository.

2021-09-27T13:39:02Z	@<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> My favorite Linux distribution is Void Linux because it doesn't use musl like Alpine does and also uses the GNU userland so it's a nice complement to my OpenBSD install. I believe the install process is friendlier than Arch afaik and also it's relatively blotless.
2021-09-27T14:01:11Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> (#<qmm4ura https://twtxt.net/search?tag=qmm4ura>) GNU is bloated but lots of stuff depends on the userland hence my preference for Void when stuff doesn't run on OpenBSD. I believe you get the point. Void doesn't have systemd, the package manager is written from scratch so it's relatively bloatless but with a _bloated_ GNU userland.

2022-01-25T22:59:03Z	(#7kuwtmq) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Why PHP based and not `pp` based?
2022-01-25T23:02:57Z	Fixed download links on https://mkws.sh/, apparently they were broken.
2022-01-26T00:07:36Z	(#arfu2lq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> `mkws` doesn't support `Markdown` out of the box, nor does it watch files. Everything is stored in non-hidden directories, is scriptable and highly customizable as opposed to `zs`. Doesn't have the concept of "plugins", you just write shell code anywhere you prefer.
2022-01-26T00:12:13Z	(#arfu2lq) If you prefer `Markdown` or/and watching/live reloading, it takes a few minutes to set-up.
2022-01-26T00:29:16Z	(#3cw3oda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well regarding what `mkws` is, just imagine only your extension system. Everything is shell script.
2022-01-26T00:42:49Z	(#3cw3oda) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Well, regarding `mkws` is about the few conventions/features: layout file, sitemap generation, css file, cache file, and the shell based templating system. You don't actually _need_ `mkws` you could write all your website in shell script (@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> is doing that I believe), but there some subjectively nice small, _optional_, features. Same with `zs` I guess.
2022-01-26T00:44:05Z	(#3cw3oda) `mkws` is basically a small set of abstractions I believe are good for generating a static site, with a very powerful templating engine.
2022-01-26T01:00:40Z	(#3cw3oda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't believe in "needs", but that's your preference. üòÄ
2022-01-26T01:17:26Z	(#cosxrlq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> To solve the problem forever, you prefer `zs` over `mkws` and there's no problem with that.
2022-01-26T01:29:48Z	(#cosxrlq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I personally am not forcing you! üòÅ

2022-01-27T15:13:38Z	(#uc65s2a) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> Actually, here is a `pp` version of  your `gen_feed.sh` script https://clbin.com/gA609, not sure about about `test -f "$f"` or `test -f "$b"` tho.
2022-01-27T15:17:48Z	(#uc65s2a) https://clbin.com/o1gcB, run with `feed > rss.xml`.
2022-01-27T15:20:10Z	(#uc65s2a) Is testing for *.html and *.html.old files existing really required?
2022-01-27T15:24:54Z	(#uc65s2a) I'm pretty sure the `test -f "$f"` is redundant, how about `test -f "$b"`? https://clbin.com/NOJ2e
2022-01-27T15:33:28Z	(#uc65s2a) Also, we'll have to fix these errors https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclbin.com%2FYDJvr
2022-01-27T15:59:58Z	(#7kuwtmq) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> I understand your points, but this is very cheap https://tinykvm.com/, not trying to convince you of anything.
2022-01-27T16:06:22Z	(#uc65s2a) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> Not sure about the namespaces either, I'd go with something like https://support.tibco.com/s/article/RSS-feed-file-example-with-minimal-xml-tags-which-can-be-used-in-Spotfire-to-setup-RSS-Feed

2022-01-28T04:32:22Z	@<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> It's a good idea to integrate https://github.com/jlj77/bookclub/blob/master/grab_pads.sh in your `/bin/mkws` file and keep the feed file separate, something like `feed.upp` and call it from the main `/bin/mkws` file like `pp feed.upp > rss.xml`.
2022-01-28T04:33:19Z	(#gsuwpwq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's not easy for me to deal "diplomatically" with situations like these.
2022-01-28T04:34:13Z	(#gsuwpwq) Tbh, that reply is on the border of mental ilness.
2022-01-28T04:38:25Z	(#gsuwpwq) But hey, I don't have mortgage.
2022-01-28T04:42:22Z	(#gsuwpwq) So they MITM all traffic then? Stupid SSH and GitHub. Anyway, just use `https` for GitHub. I personally also prefer SSH.
2022-01-28T04:43:21Z	(#gsuwpwq) Why aren't they closing 443 also because they can't MITM https?
2022-01-28T06:43:27Z	(#6vkohjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Shouldn't you be working rather than wasting time here then, just a friendly advice! üòõ

2022-02-09T22:22:51Z	(#3bpnssa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> They're just themes, everybody has preferences. @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> uses a pixelated font. Monospaced fonts give a _hacker_ look to a web site: https://christine.website/
2022-02-09T22:36:17Z	(#3bpnssa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hacker as in someone who _hacks_ (tinkers, writes) computer software.
2022-02-09T22:42:31Z	(#phhl5bq) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Really simple with just `pp` or https://mkws.sh, check it out https://mkws.sh/pp.html‚Ä®‚Ä®    <!doctype html>‚Ä®    <title>fortune</title>‚Ä®    <h1>fortune</h1>‚Ä®    <pre>‚Ä®    <code>‚Ä®    #!‚Ä®    /usr/games/fortune‚Ä®    #!‚Ä®    </code>‚Ä®    </pre>
2022-02-09T22:47:05Z	(#3bpnssa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Depends on the person/community mostly.
2022-02-09T22:49:04Z	(#3bpnssa) Also https://envs.net/! üòã
2022-02-09T22:50:17Z	(#tamt5nq) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Would be nice if anybody would use them.
2022-02-09T23:05:46Z	(#tamt5nq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Did I ever hope? Yes, was it realistic? No! Am I hoping now? No! Did I ever make expectations? Yes, were they realistic? No!, So yes, I believe it's a bad idea to both hope or make expectations! ‚Ä®‚Ä®How can you be let down if you don't hope or don't have expectations, things are how they are, you're being honest rather than delusional! Regarding ending in up in despair, I answered here https://twtxt.net/twt/quxxkoa
2022-02-09T23:17:41Z	(#phhl5bq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> How is that simpler?‚Ä®But there:‚Ä®‚Ä®    <!doctype html>‚Ä®    <title>fortune</title>‚Ä®    <h1>fortune</h1>‚Ä®    <pre>‚Ä®    <code>$(/usr/games/fortune)</code>‚Ä®    </pre>
2022-02-09T23:22:05Z	(#wilgbuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I wonder if it's a good idea to assume that punctuation marks at the end of the url are not part of the url, they're more commonly punctuation marks?‚Ä®‚Ä®> Is this the correct url https://twtxt.net?
2022-02-09T23:26:27Z	(#phhl5bq) @<~duriny https://envs.net/~duriny/twtxt.txt> But you're serving as CGI. üòÅ
2022-02-09T23:28:26Z	(#phhl5bq) But! You could also run `pp` under CGI!
2022-02-09T23:38:32Z	(#phhl5bq) @<~duriny https://envs.net/~duriny/twtxt.txt> No, `pp` as in http://mkws.sh/pp.html
2022-02-09T23:59:36Z	(#tz5ls7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Oh, sarcastic!
2022-02-10T00:07:36Z	(#wilgbuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Your opinion!
2022-02-10T00:10:26Z	(#tamt5nq) You just live, that's all! Why desire anything? If you believe not desiring is unhealthy, ask a mental health proffesional for his opinion!
2022-02-10T00:11:02Z	(#tamt5nq) Yes, I'm content!
2022-02-10T00:14:00Z	(#a3uxbga) @<~duriny https://envs.net/~duriny/twtxt.txt> Either symlink or compile yourself.
2022-02-10T00:24:56Z	(#wilgbuq) I personally would violate it in this case.
2022-02-10T00:27:16Z	(#wilgbuq) I mean, what kind of url is https://mkws.sh? or https://mkws!. I would violate it only if the punctuation mark is the final caracter in the twt.
2022-02-10T00:32:12Z	(#hacvlua) I personally believe NFTs as technical idea is a good one, if the items are really that valuable, I really don't believe so, but people are paying for them, so...
2022-02-10T00:35:32Z	(#wilgbuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I, most of the time follow and agree with the standards and understand their value but there are exceptions when I believe it's not the end of the world to violate them for various reasons, like in this case. But it's my opinion, I'm not trying to convince you.
2022-02-10T00:45:18Z	(#wilgbuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sure man, no problem! üòÅ

2022-02-10T01:41:59Z	(#wilgbuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> But which standard do we respect, the URI one or English punctuation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_punctuation!
2022-02-10T01:47:28Z	(#wilgbuq) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Do you always link that?
2022-02-10T01:48:42Z	(#wilgbuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> So you'd rather respect the URI  standard rather than English punctuation?
2022-02-10T01:50:24Z	(#wilgbuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> No it's not a "standard" but it does have rules.

2022-02-10T02:15:58Z	(#lqhffuq) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I see, like you did here https://twtxt.net/twt/4cgtvoa!
2022-02-10T02:20:28Z	(#lqhffuq) Point is you do sometimes paste full urls and it's not a good idea to accuse everybody who does so of laziness, I say, lots of people paste full urls, it's not an abnormal behaviour and yes, I believe it's a good idea to allow ending a sentence with an url AND punctuation mark like English punctuation ALLOWS!
2022-02-10T02:21:30Z	(#lqhffuq) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Maybe if you weren't so lazy you would have deleted that exclamation mark from the address bar! üòé

2022-02-10T02:28:24Z	(#lqhffuq) I wonder which  _!_ is part of the URL and which _!_ is the punctuation mark? üòÅ
2022-02-10T02:33:03Z	(#lqhffuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I understand they're valid links, but they're VERY VERY RARE!

2022-02-10T02:43:46Z	(#lx6pa3q) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I personally don't interpret‚Ä®‚Ä®> VERY VERY RARE‚Ä®‚Ä®as yelling more of as "trying to make a point".
2022-02-10T02:47:11Z	(#lqhffuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> So you don't know of *any other example of an url ending with an !* that you have to personally craft one? üòÅ
2022-02-10T02:51:52Z	(#lqhffuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's a nice web site, I agree. üòÅ Can you give me 3 more examples of sites with urls ending in "!". I understand they're valid urls I'm just saying they're really rare.

This for my installation of Void Linux, your partition data may vary. Just download and run if you run a https://tinykvm.com/ instance.
2022-02-20T21:37:29Z	Also, this looks amazing, Lua in the browser [https://fengari.io/](https://fengari.io/)!
2022-02-20T23:29:04Z	(#cnzbvya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> If you're talking about the custom attributes and nesting code with `HTML`, I agree, but I agree with‚Ä®‚Ä®> ‚Äúsprinkling‚Äù a small amount of interactions on an existing HTML page rendered by a server framework

2022-02-21T00:25:03Z	(#inpmima) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> You could script a web page with Lua, not sure how fast it, not quite as impractical as Linux in the browser.
2022-02-21T00:54:45Z	(#inpmima) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, that's super weird!
2022-02-21T00:55:38Z	(#inpmima) Not sure if bad idea tho.
2022-02-21T03:00:20Z	(#inpmima) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> How would you use `mkws` and `lua`?
2022-02-21T03:06:30Z	(#inpmima) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Makes sense!
2022-02-21T03:08:59Z	(#inpmima) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> We're discussing `lua` as an alternative to `js` in the browser.
2022-02-21T03:11:24Z	(#inpmima) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I don't believe that's how you would use Lua in the browser with Fengari.
2022-02-21T03:16:45Z	(#inpmima) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Not sure how slow Fengari is.
2022-02-21T03:17:34Z	(#inpmima) But probably, yeah, I'd just write JavaScript tho.
2022-02-21T03:25:57Z	(#inpmima) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Great analogy!

2022-02-22T20:59:38Z	(#djb7lbq) When it comes to `zs`, I disagree with the hidden directories `.pub`, `.zs`, especially considering that hidden directories in `UNIX` where a _mistake_. Looks clean, but it's not. Plan 9 doesn't have them.‚Ä®‚Ä®It's like _hiding_ complexity, best is not to have complexity to hide.
2022-02-22T21:03:12Z	(#djb7lbq) Also `mkws` has a _familiar_ directory structure, you kinda intuit where stuff goes.
2022-02-22T21:04:36Z	(#djb7lbq) Any kind of _extensions_ go in `bin`, simple, shared stuff goes in `share`, again, familiar and simple, and in plain view, you KNOW the directories are there, no looking for them, plain `ls` just works, you don't have to `ls -a`.
2022-02-22T21:06:53Z	(#djb7lbq) > It‚Äôs like hiding complexity, best is not to have complexity to hide.‚Ä®‚Ä®Or if you have complexity, keep it as close to the reader's eyes as possible.

2022-02-22T21:13:48Z	(#djb7lbq) Also `Markdown` by default falls short when it comes to customizability, if you have lots of pages, then yes and maybe writing often (blog), I agree, it's a good idea to use `Markdown`, but if you have a 3-4 page site, that you don't update often, `HTML` is enough IMO and _the good tool_. Having to do all this in `Markdown` https://peguero.xyz/ might not work so great! I'm pretty sure he's using `Markdown` for the blog posts tho.
2022-02-22T21:21:31Z	Btw @<stutteringsteve https://twtxt.net/user/stutteringsteve/twtxt.txt> wrote a piece [https://peguero.xyz/blog/boston_im_breaking_up_with_you.html](https://peguero.xyz/blog/boston_im_breaking_up_with_you.html)!

2022-02-22T21:35:49Z	(#2k3rywq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> But disagree on _opinion_ but rather _fact_ that for complex pages `Markdown` is ill suited as you yourself saw when building https://prologic.shortcircuit.net.au/
2022-02-22T21:41:11Z	(#2k3rywq) Granted we simplified that and remove most `HTML` from `Markdown` as far as I remember.
2022-02-22T21:42:42Z	(#5g62wka) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> https://github.com/imdario/zas doesn't say anything about initials, is this the original repo?
2022-02-22T21:45:08Z	(#2k3rywq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Facts and opinions are different! It's a fact!
2022-02-22T21:47:48Z	(#2k3rywq) @<prologic https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Arguing doesn't work by us trying to convince each other, arguing works by us providing logically correct arguments and proof. When there is enough evidence (proof, arguments) that a statement is true, it becomes a _fact_, not an _opinion_.
2022-02-22T22:12:00Z	(#2k3rywq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®‚Ä®> fact that for complex pages Markdown is ill suited‚Ä®‚Ä®Do you believe `Markdown` is suited for something like this https://git.suckless.org/9base/log.html or this https://git.suckless.org/9base/commit/09e95a2d6f8dbafc6601147b2f5f150355813be6.html? Those are statically generated btw.
2022-02-22T22:14:42Z	(#2k3rywq) Or actually, if `Markdown` was that great for everything, we would all be writing `Markdown`, not `HTML`.
2022-02-22T22:22:29Z	(#2k3rywq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The fact that most of the WWW is written in `HTML` is evidence enough.
2022-02-22T22:23:38Z	(#2k3rywq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's evidence that you wouldn't have a great time writing https://git.suckless.org/9base/commit/09e95a2d6f8dbafc6601147b2f5f150355813be6.html in `Markdown`, don't nitpick on words, whereas `HTML` is doing a good job there.
2022-02-22T22:33:19Z	(#2k3rywq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Also, forms!
2022-02-22T22:37:01Z	(#2k3rywq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Also https://mkws.sh/
2022-02-22T22:50:23Z	(#2k3rywq) I say, use `Markdown` when you're updating often, like blog posts, `Markdown` is easier on the fingers indeed (less to write) but when doing the _presentation_ part, do `HTML`.
2022-02-22T22:54:43Z	(#2k3rywq) In `mkws`  I used `HTML` by default because using `Markdown` as most static site generators do feels limiting. That's why people complain they of the lack of customizability. In the `About Me`, `My Projects`, `Other Stuff` _presentation_ pages you can go as wild as you prefer with `HTML`, on the blog side, do `Markdown`.
2022-02-22T22:59:14Z	(#2k3rywq) When you get to customizing your _presentation_ pages  you wrote in `Markdown` you start to see its limits, that it's not that flexibile and you have to get in the internals of the static site generator, complicating things.
2022-02-22T23:02:35Z	(#pneitwq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yeah, that's pretty cool!
2022-02-22T23:05:14Z	(#pneitwq) `mdoc(7)` is also nice if you're on OpenBSD to get a nice `mdoc` template.
2022-02-22T23:07:03Z	(#2k3rywq) It's super complicated to customize these _simple_ `Markdown` based static site generator!
2022-02-22T23:08:51Z	(#2k3rywq) Because `Markdown` was made mostly for content less for presentation.
2022-02-22T23:23:41Z	(#2k3rywq) _article content_, _blog content_, rather than _presentation content_.
2022-02-22T23:34:58Z	(#2k3rywq) > The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.‚Ä®‚Ä®and‚Ä®‚Ä®> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web **writers**.
2022-02-23T00:04:17Z	(#2k3rywq) ‚Ä®‚Ä®> The idea was to make writing simple web pages, and **especially weblog entries**‚Ä®‚Ä®> We‚Äôve tested it extensively: on our blogs, in my comments form, in our emails.‚Ä®‚Ä®http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001189‚Ä®‚Ä®And by "simple web pages" he means this kind of _simple_ https://mkws.sh/docs.html !‚Ä®‚Ä®`Markdown` is not for landing pages like https://mkws.sh or https://peguero.xyz/ or https://www.andrewjvpowell.com/.
2022-02-23T00:21:17Z	(#2k3rywq) More proof!‚Ä®‚Ä®> The basic idea behind all weblog software ‚Äî reduced to a nutshell ‚Äî seems so simple in retrospect. Rather than managing a web site as a collection of pages, you manage **a collection of posts**, and the **weblog software** takes care of turning the posts into pages for you.‚Ä®‚Ä®https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/dive_into_markdown
2022-02-23T00:23:17Z	(#2k3rywq) ‚Ä®‚Ä®>That is of course your opinion bud üòÜ And one I don‚Äôt share ü§ó‚Ä®‚Ä®Not opinion but quotes from the authors!
2022-02-23T00:48:11Z	(#2k3rywq) So basically, **lots of static site generators are actually static blog generators!**
2022-02-23T00:55:22Z	We're using static blog generators to generate static sites and blogging software (Wordpress) to generate presentation sites, congratulations everyone for "succeeding"!
2022-02-23T01:05:33Z	(#2k3rywq) > Markdown is not for landing pages like https://mkws.sh or https://peguero.xyz/ or https://www.andrewjvpowell.com/.‚Ä®‚Ä®Ok, I misunderstood the term ‚Äúlanding page‚Äù, but the main idea is Markdown is for blog posts.
2022-02-23T02:08:44Z	(#bxxbuya) @<mutefall https://twtxt.net/user/mutefall/twtxt.txt> I believe most of us agree over here that it's a good idea that everybody runs their own website.
2022-02-23T04:33:58Z	(#dfxgdfq) This idea would go great with `mkws` http://s.minos.io/ (and other stuff too), but I don't see any http server or `Markdown` procesor (`smu`, `lowdown`, `cmark`, `discount`) inside.
2022-02-23T13:43:04Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Did you read the stuff about having `Markdown` by default in a ssg?
2022-02-23T23:41:52Z	(#djb7lbq) @<jan6 https://twtxt.net/user/jan6/twtxt.txt> Yes, I understand it supports inline html, is it a good idea to inline `HTML` in `Markdown`? I believe most of the times, no, but again `Markdown` is mostly for blog post like content.
2022-02-23T23:54:39Z	Discovered this these https://github.com/kyx0r/nextvi, small, clean `vi` implementation: https://github.com/kyx0r/nextvi
2022-02-23T23:57:46Z	(#djb7lbq) @<jan6 https://twtxt.net/user/jan6/twtxt.txt> Would like to see the source code, yes!
2022-02-24T00:01:41Z	(#djb7lbq) @<jan6 https://twtxt.net/user/jan6/twtxt.txt> Why not just do plain `HTML` then if you're getting into more complex stuff? Why insist on `Markdown`? Use `Markdown` for blog posts or similar content and use `HTML` for the complex stuff?
2022-02-24T00:11:27Z	(#djb7lbq) @<jan6 https://twtxt.net/user/jan6/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I see... Have you considered `m4(1)`, altough I'm not a big fan of the syntax?
2022-02-24T00:13:06Z	(#5g62wka) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Who, me?
2022-02-24T00:18:49Z	(#djb7lbq) @<jan6 https://twtxt.net/user/jan6/twtxt.txt> Well, `mkws` is my solution, you could replace the main script with `make(1)` or Plan9's `mk(1)`  if the build time gets too long, but it makes sense it works well, you're basically compiling "source code", `.upphtml` files to "binaries", `.html` files using a compiler, `pp`. All the tooling fits well.
2022-02-24T00:20:03Z	(#djb7lbq) Here's a `mk(1)` version https://adi.onl/bin/mkfile !

2022-03-23T18:33:15Z	(#iphs6mq) Having a Gopher server in shell sounds weird, maybe C or Go would be better for that, but for small, simple, UNIX automations nothing beats shell. Keywords are small and simple. If things get complex, either create a new script or switch languages.

2022-09-17T20:47:28Z	(#xsnmvda) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> It doesn't have to output specialized templates, it works with normal full server side pages. It extracts the `main` element's content and replaces it in the current page. Of course, it could be optimized for sending only fragments.
2022-09-17T20:48:43Z	(#xsnmvda) Basically, just add it over any server side rendered web site and it works.
2022-09-17T20:51:17Z	(#xsnmvda) I, personally am not a big fan of custom attributes, but that's what we have right now https://unpoly.com/, https://htmx.org/ and https://github.com/hotwired/turbo

I actually set up recurrent donations on the web site at https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7QXC2F3ANCDC2. I'd probably cancel the buy me a coffee subscription and go with that instead, I'd rather not pay a buy me a cofee comission. I really am required to get $40 by the 10th to renew the mkws.sh domain, so anybody who would like to contribute is welcomed!
2022-12-07T19:36:15Z	(#cpwvyxq) I believe you can also make recurrent payments from the Revolut app (I pay 0 comissions on Revolut), from the Hub->Pockets section!

2023-02-13T19:30:27Z	After seeing some ChatGPT interactions I believe all doomsday AI scenarios are stupid and I also believe it's impossible for an intelligent creature to create a _creature_ more intelligent than itself.
2023-02-13T19:33:20Z	I believe ChatGPT is just an example of Artificial Stupidity! Does that term exist?

2023-03-13T01:00:20Z	I recently discovered [Jack Harlow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6vZl7Qj7JglLDmN_7Or-ZQ/), all his pieces are great, but my favorites, in order of preference are [Side Piece ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2_8GkA3HA8) and [Like A Blade of Grass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0a5i-jJ77s)
2023-03-13T01:03:38Z	(#bg5l56q) He's _doing_ [Dua Lipa ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUqYdsBjZxg) as far as I know and not as in singing the song! Dua Lipa for me personally, is the most beautiful female artist at the moment.
2023-03-13T01:24:48Z	(#bg5l56q) Also kinda discovered [Mark Ronson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSY5V7BJSrxNvvBF0Drslow)
2023-03-13T02:11:11Z	(#fupapta) @<prologic https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I configured a DragonFlyBSD backup server recently on a https://www.kimsufi.com/en-ie/dedicated-servers/ 5‚Ç¨ dedicated server. 2 TB of disk space for 5‚Ç¨  a month, very good offer. Now I have to configure some cli  Bitcoin and Monero wallets on that server, but `monerod` is hogging all my CPU! It's weird that cyptocurrency is supposed to be decentralized and there we are keeping our money in centralized locations like FTX or Binance.
2023-03-13T02:39:41Z	(#fupapta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Centralized because of the mining process, right?
2023-03-13T02:40:25Z	(#wmv5u6a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, it's very cool!
2023-03-13T05:03:07Z	(#fupapta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®‚Ä®> but you are essentially centralizing the storage of transactions, the so-called block chain, ledger, onto infrastructure and computers that aren‚Äôt yours or in your control.‚Ä®‚Ä®Which exactly are those computers? Isn't the blockchain distributed and stored on each individual node?
2023-03-13T23:06:00Z	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I was talking more about political and financial decentralization, as in no institution to regulate it, but the discussion derailed to technical decentralization. The idea of an institution that can allow you or prevent you from withdrawing money for instance, like Binance or FTX.
2023-03-13T23:18:39Z	Now tell me how can I prevent `monerod` from hogging on my CPU. I'm on DragonFly BSD, `cpulimit` doesn't works, also `nice` doesn't. I believe this is an IRC question.
2023-03-14T00:09:14Z	(#7w2qk7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's just for a wallet?
2023-03-14T02:31:30Z	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I'm saying that this were the original ideas of cryptocurrency. Having no central institution to regulate it, like central banks or a central place that has controle over your money. The cryptocurrency  industry has collapsed exactly because people "invested" in an centralized exchange and hedge fund like FTX. Exactly what I'm saying, this is not a cryptocurrency issue, but just fraud.
2023-03-14T02:35:03Z	(#fupapta) @<prologic https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®‚Ä®> How is an institition different from a few powerful players that control >50% of the network? ü§î ‚Ä®‚Ä®I can't say I understand completely how cryptocurrency, works, I  wasn't interested in the subject until recently but this is what they say: https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-51-attack/‚Ä®‚Ä®> A 51% attack, however, is theoretically limited in the amount of disruption it can cause. While the attacker could trigger the double-spending problem, they cannot reverse others‚Äô transactions on the network or prevent users from broadcasting their transactions to the network. Additionally, a 51% attack is incapable of creating new assets, stealing assets from unrelated parties or altering the functionality of block rewards.‚Ä®‚Ä®This is not verified by me personally and and the source is a crypto exchange.
2023-03-14T02:43:47Z	(#7w2qk7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well, I'm using this https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/monero-wallet-cli.html, any other options?
2023-03-14T03:06:10Z	(#7w2qk7q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Any CLI one?
2023-03-14T03:21:29Z	(#7w2qk7q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Yes, I understand this!
2023-03-14T06:15:38Z	(#7w2qk7q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®‚Ä®I understand it's not a good idea to keep your wallet on the VPS. It is preferred to run your own node?
2023-03-14T06:16:49Z	It's interesting there's a "just works" philosophy and no "just doesn't work" philosphy!
2023-03-14T15:51:05Z	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®> Love it or hate it, institutionalized fiat currency has value because the issuing country has people with guns who will drag you off to a metal box if you don‚Äôt use the currency in the intended ways (unless you‚Äôre super rich I guess). ‚Ä®‚Ä®Yes, 100% agree on this!‚Ä®‚Ä®> The cryptocurrency industry collapsed because the idea at its core is a Ponzi scheme. It doesn‚Äôt matter how you implement the Ponzi scheme in software. The only way to accrue value is to bring in more people who are willing to pay more money for the currency than what you paid for it. That‚Äôs the literal definition of a Ponzi scheme and is inherently unstable (it crashes the moment the of rate of incoming new users slows down).‚Ä®‚Ä®That's the problem, people saw cryptocurrencies as way to make money quick (classic money making problem), it's not that the idea of cryptocurrency is a Ponzi scheme, is that people are using it to engineer Ponzi schemes or do fraud with it as they do with fiat money.
2023-03-14T16:07:14Z	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®‚Ä®>  The only way to accrue value is to bring in more people who are willing to pay more money for the currency than what you paid for it.‚Ä®‚Ä®Crypto increases or decreases in value just as any other good (or currency), based on demand, you can do Ponzi schemes with potatoes, you can't say potates at their core are Ponzi scheme.‚Ä®‚Ä®> institutionalized fiat currency has value because the issuing country has people with guns who will drag you off to a metal box if you don‚Äôt use the currency in the intended ways (unless you‚Äôre super rich I guess).‚Ä®‚Ä®And cypto's value is that it's  a currency outside the (at least the digital) reach of a countries institutions. No institution can give an order to block your transactions! Even if you're bank account is blocked, you can still trade with crypto! That's at least one of the reasons it has value!
2023-03-14T16:10:40Z	(#fupapta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I understand crypto is an implementation of the blockchain, distributed legder, if that's what you mean. I may use the terms as if they were same thing. Where do you think the confusion is?
2023-03-14T16:19:13Z	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®‚Ä®> That is not a value. I have absolutely no need or desire for that, nor do the vast majority of people. People avoiding accountability from their community might view it as such.‚Ä®‚Ä®You can never tell for sure, that's where crypto's values lies in.‚Ä®‚Ä®I have no doubt a lot of crypto transactions have been made with the West sanctions and all. That's value!
2023-03-14T16:29:19Z	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®‚Ä®> You‚Äôre literally trying to say that if your community has decided that you should not have access to certain funds, you should be empowered to thwart that decision.‚Ä®‚Ä®Yes, because it's YOUR money!‚Ä®‚Ä®> Banks can‚Äôt legally decide that you no longer have access to your funds. You have a right to those funds that is protected by law. Legal authorities in some cases can restrict your access to your funds, but there is a reason and purpose to that, and in theory that reason and purpose is protection of the community. Yes I know I‚Äôm being simplistic, but the alternative is to take the extreme libertarian view that these institutions are all broken and hostile beyond hope, we should resist them at all costs, everyone else be damned. ‚Ä®‚Ä®You're going to extremes now, I'm saying there MAY BE SOME situations when if would be a could idea to have some money outside of the institution control.
2023-03-14T16:32:56Z	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®‚Ä®> Get a bunch of cash, bonds, and prepaid debit cards and bury it all in your backyard. That‚Äôs far better.‚Ä®‚Ä®I believe that in those kind of situations is better to have your cash in digital form rather than in any kind of physical form, not sure if prepaid cards can't be blocked.
2023-03-14T16:33:57Z	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®‚Ä®> well, fuck Russia lol. Crypto should burn if only to deny those genocidal pricks access to money.‚Ä®‚Ä®What if the balance of power would change? What if you would be affected?

2023-04-10T12:38:00Z	Btw, `mkws` works GREAT with Plan9 [mk](https://9p.io/sys/doc/mk.html). You just replace the `bin/mkws` script with a `mkfile`. It's drop in! Just create a `mkfile` in the `bin` directory, name it `mkws` and use a `mk` shebank like `#!/usr/local/plan9/bin/mk -f`.‚Ä®‚Ä®    #!/usr/local/plan9/bin/mk -f‚Ä®‚Ä®    URL=//example.com‚Ä®    SHARE=share‚Ä®‚Ä®    THEMEFILES=$SHARE/l.upphtml\‚Ä®        $SHARE/s.uppcss\‚Ä®‚Ä®    TPLFILES=`{find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.upphtml" | cut -c3-}‚Ä®    HTMLFILES=${TPLFILES:%.upphtml=%.html}‚Ä®‚Ä®    $URL:V: sitemap.xml $HTMLFILES‚Ä®‚Ä®    %.html:Q: %.upphtml $THEMEFILES‚Ä®        echo Making $target‚Ä®        pp $SHARE/l.upphtml ${target%.html}.upphtml $URL > $target‚Ä®‚Ä®    sitemap.xml:Q: $HTMLFILES $SHARE/sitemap.uppxml‚Ä®        echo Making $target‚Ä®        pp $SHARE/sitemap.uppxml $URL > $target‚Ä®‚Ä®    clean:VQ:‚Ä®        echo "$HTMLFILES" sitemap.xml | xargs -n1 echo "Removing"‚Ä®        rm -f $HTMLFILES sitemap.xml‚Ä®‚Ä®There, your web site builds only when assets are out of date!`
2023-04-10T12:42:02Z	(#aq5xyja) `mk` can be installed on `Linux`/`BSD` systems via [plan9port](https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/)!

2023-04-10T14:26:43Z	@<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> Very grateful for the 5‚Ç¨/month donation, it's paying my backup server Intel ATOM N2800 [Kimsufi](https://www.kimsufi.com/en-ie/dedicated-servers/) dedicated server. It's running DragonflyBSD! :D
2023-04-10T19:45:33Z	(#2dlcg3a) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> And what's preventing you from running it?
2023-04-10T19:55:57Z	(#2dlcg3a) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Get the cheap 5‚Ç¨ server from [Kimsufi](https://www.kimsufi.com/en-ie/dedicated-servers/) when it's available and have fun installing it via `NFS` with no `VNC`. I had alot of fun installing it.
2023-04-10T20:01:59Z	(#2dlcg3a) Use it as backup machine!
2023-04-11T15:25:08Z	Ok, I have to make 200‚Ç¨ to pay rent. I've moved places in the meantime! Have a decent place. You're familiar with my work, let me know if you have some problems I could solve!
2023-04-11T15:42:31Z	Oh, btw, I'm considering building a VCS. The whole repository is just a single big patch file. It's for small projects tho. Ideas on what problems I might encounter with this approach?
2023-04-11T15:50:45Z	(#bcwm4fa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Is the repo plain text?
2023-04-11T15:51:39Z	(#bcwm4fa) My VCS would allow you use standard UNIX tools like `diff` and `patch`.
2023-04-11T15:55:18Z	(#bcwm4fa) Example _repo_ for my VCS‚Ä®‚Ä®https://envs.sh/hzH.diff
2023-04-11T16:19:44Z	(#alrqzkq) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Interested in migrating https://cbrueggenolte.de/ to `mkws`? Isn't flask a little bit overkill? :D I could do the work! :D
2023-04-11T17:19:06Z	(#bcwm4fa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Ah, I remember at leas one issue I had with Pijul. Rust....
2023-04-11T17:27:08Z	(#bcwm4fa) I'm installing now, It's not the first time. I remember tho I wasn't satisfied with their repo format.
2023-04-11T17:38:24Z	(#alrqzkq) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> Also, if you have any problems I could solve?
2023-04-11T17:40:25Z	(#bcwm4fa) Yeah, errors on ` cargo install pijul --version "~1.0.0-beta"`...
2023-04-11T17:49:36Z	(#alrqzkq) Also, don't tell me to get a job, my sleep schedule is fucked and I don't want to do React.
2023-04-11T17:50:29Z	(#alrqzkq) I was rejected for a `go` job a while ago @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> , weird reasons. Something that I sent a "Resume" instead of a "CV".
2023-04-11T18:27:52Z	(#bcwm4fa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Ran it on OpenBSD, running it on Linux now.
2023-04-11T19:26:12Z	(#bcwm4fa) Error compiling `nix`. Crap, so complicated! See, that's why I'm building a VCS and not doing React.
2023-04-12T12:57:04Z	(#bcwm4fa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm not a big fan of the CLI interface!
2023-04-12T12:57:25Z	(#bcwm4fa) And I'd rather have a plain text repo!
2023-04-12T18:19:09Z	(#bcwm4fa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I'm considering a simpler storage format.
2023-04-12T19:30:48Z	(#bcwm4fa) Like this https://envs.sh/hzH.diff, it's a single patch file.
2023-04-21T16:29:10Z	(#zyhzp7q) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Wow! You drew this?

2023-06-04T09:35:20Z	(#wqgxhea) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I've integrated it in my workflow! I can validate all my `HTML`s via a shell script before uploading!
2023-07-16T23:16:27Z	Been doing some embedded development lately. Building a driver for an electricity metering chip. First time I developed a driver. Got some $$$ also finally! :D
2023-07-26T10:21:06Z	@<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> Can you recommend me some good pixelated fonts?
2023-07-27T17:32:00Z	(#4sbpj2q) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> I may be settling on the one shown here https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser/
2023-07-27T17:35:22Z	(#4sbpj2q) Not sure about the licensing tho.
2023-08-31T04:17:41Z	Ok, broke off my relationship with the guys I developed the driver for. They're using a C framework which I find super crappy (https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) and I do plain C.‚Ä®‚Ä®I developed the driver in plain C.
2023-08-31T04:21:01Z	Also, I'll never take responsibility for other people's **expectations**! I do what I do, work as I work, am as I am, never do what _should_  do, work as I _should_ work, be as I _should_ be.

2023-09-01T09:30:54Z	I remember as a teenager thinking of [Republica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgffRW1fKDk) as _the other [Garbage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypr18UmxOas)_ :D
2023-09-01T12:15:02Z	(#7dxtvnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's the new model of Fairphone? :D It's self upgradable and repairable, not sure about the upgradable part.
2023-09-01T12:15:43Z	(#7dxtvnq) Self as in the user repairs his own phone.
2023-09-01T13:14:46Z	(#7dxtvnq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Let's say that for me personally it's an option that _sucks less_.
2023-09-01T13:17:19Z	I wonder why people didn't settle on `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` as `~/etc`. Makes so much sense!

2023-09-01T14:22:14Z	(#7doseoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ah, I personally wouldn't want a web app, just use whatever client you prefer.
2023-09-01T14:23:03Z	(#7doseoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> See https://www.sogo.nu/, it looks it has an web app.
2023-09-01T14:27:22Z	(#7doseoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Maybe install the server and a separate web app of your preference. Or use Gmail as a client if it works?
2023-09-01T15:00:30Z	(#7doseoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'd just go with radicale or kcaldav √Æn this situation.

2024-01-30T18:25:46Z	(#vt6nxha) You quit `cu` by pressing `~.`. If that doesn't work, "just hit Enter a couple of times before the combination" (read it on some forum).

2024-02-29T01:23:10Z	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> This is what I was using `cu` for https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf?tab=readme-ov-file#viewing-serial-output
2024-03-01T12:14:05Z	(#b3ia53a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> That was for an energy metering driver I made (EV charging stations).‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm currently working on a VCS for small projects. Single file, plain text repository made entirely of just patches. I'm currently porting to 9Front and all I have is to do add suport for 3 way merging (I think I'll just use `diff3` on Linux and `merge3` on OpenBSD for that. Currently it only supports plain text and no binaries.‚Ä®‚Ä®This an example repo for my dotfiles https://0x0.st/HRnc.diff, view log implementation in `awk`: https://0x0.st/HRnT.sh‚Ä®‚Ä®@everybody ‚Ä®If interested, some üíµ would be great as I've been out of job for a few months now and they payed like shit when I was working with them.‚Ä®‚Ä®https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7QXC2F3ANCDC2‚Ä®‚Ä®You could clone that repo with only:‚Ä®‚Ä®    curl https://0x0.st/HRnc.diff | tee v | patch -p0 ‚Ä®‚Ä®However, `patch` would leave some extra files in the directory.
2024-03-01T13:54:23Z	Oh, btw, previous guys I worked with never heard of Go!
2024-03-01T22:19:48Z	(#7wys7xa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah! They called themselves embedded C programmers, pretty sure they couldn't write a `Makefile`. I called them scammers tbh!
2024-03-01T22:24:54Z	(#7wys7xa) @<prologic https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> They knew about `microPython`, but the boss never heard about Go, the other guy may have heard of it tho,... I think!
2024-03-01T22:28:34Z	(#7wys7xa) The owner/boss was a Python progammer, never heard of Go!
2024-03-01T22:38:35Z	(#7wys7xa) @<prologic https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> They were doing embedded development just like you would JavaScript development, using only "the framework", as I said: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf, compile times were super long (20s), the boss asked "How many times do I compile **per day**?" I said: "constantly....". Just couldn't work with the framework, was super slow. Had to develop the driver bare metal and after that integrate it!
2024-03-02T00:43:07Z	I just figured out, their domain was just one letter different from another EV charging company domain.
2024-03-02T01:03:38Z	(#acum7hq) In their defense, they don't have a web site up at that domain address.
2024-03-02T14:37:54Z	(#rjfiy7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Lots of content is crap tbh!
2024-03-31T21:33:39Z	Ok, had some fun porting 9front virtio drivers to 9legacy for OpenBSD vmd:‚Ä®‚Ä®https://prnt.sc/xOCx0q7yT_WD
2024-04-01T18:20:50Z	(#stg6sjq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> https://9front.org/ is a fork of the original https://plan9.io/plan9/. I just ported 9fronts drivers (https://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/1b51d5683a5d8adcde03bbd277e6331f23c2f723/sys/src/9/pc/ethervirtio.c/f.html and https://git.9front.org/plan9front/plan9front/1b51d5683a5d8adcde03bbd277e6331f23c2f723/sys/src/9/pc/sdvirtio.c/f.html) to the original Plan 9. It was almost drop in to be honest. If I were to build one from scratch, there's this: https://brennan.io/2020/03/22/sos-block-device/, looks digestible.
2024-04-01T21:07:19Z	Oh, and I'm finally starting to feel confortable with `ed`. :D
2024-04-04T11:35:13Z	(#dabdvaq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> For some reason I kept reading `dusage` like you would read French `visage`.
2024-04-04T19:19:58Z	(#dabdvaq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Sounds very frenchy "d'usage" or something like that.
2024-04-04T19:23:57Z	Earliest version of `mkws` https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/ShellScript.html üòÄ from the first web site ever.
2024-04-04T19:27:10Z	I see myself slowly migrating to Plan 9.
2024-04-04T19:42:28Z	(#dabdvaq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I'm pretty happy with my naming abilites. I do alot of research before hand tho so that my names fit with the overall naming scheme. `dusage` is not a bad name to be honest, but we already have `du` with is short for "disk usage", if you don't have a `du` in OS/2 I think it's an ok name.
2024-04-05T06:05:44Z	(#stg6sjq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Ooops, there were already ported drivers http://9legacy.org/9legacy/patch/pc-sdvirtio.diff. Oh well, learning experience.
2024-04-05T08:21:18Z	(#ndaoqya) @<Anthony_Sorace http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt> That's money for p9f?
2024-04-05T17:35:26Z	(#dabdvaq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Matters for your own personal sense of satisfaction.
2024-04-08T22:53:54Z	(#ndaoqya) @<Anthony_Sorace http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt> Haha, no leads ! But would be cool! :)
2024-04-08T22:59:08Z	(#d6xxntq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  There's no guarantee you'll increase your portofolio and wealth if you invest, much less if you borrow to invest.
2024-04-08T23:42:39Z	I just remembered Mr. Oizo https://youtu.be/qmsbP13xu6k?si=g7yNfWeONis8D5Eh
2024-04-15T10:18:19Z	I'm tinkering with the Plan 9 9k kernel https://github.com/0intro/plan9-contrib/tree/main/sys/src/9k testing if I can boot it on OpenBSD `vmm`, it's booting but interrupts don't work.
2024-04-15T11:41:36Z	(#b6m7laq) And it booted‚Ä®‚Ä®https://prnt.sc/ftkB-yLhbccZ‚Ä®‚Ä®I can drawterm and all.
2024-04-15T11:43:43Z	(#b6m7laq) Serial console doesn't work tho.
2024-04-15T11:51:06Z	(#b6m7laq) Also, not sure about those _lost_ RAM.
2024-04-28T18:13:47Z	(#dxg2rta) @<Anthony_Sorace http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt> I have a ton of ideas to implement for Plan 9 but I recently discovered http://www.collyer.net/who/geoff/9/ Geoff's 9k but still didn't get it to boot on OpenBSD vmm. For now, main problem is the serial console is not working I think. I'll have to diff with jmk... I think again.
2024-04-29T01:26:04Z	(#dxg2rta) @<Anthony_Sorace http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt> I'm getting:‚Ä®‚Ä®    magicclock.c:189 function args not checked: drawclock‚Ä®    magicclock.c:234 function args not checked: drawclock‚Ä®‚Ä®btw, fixed it myself``
2024-04-29T01:37:40Z	(#dxg2rta) It somehow reminded me of https://youtu.be/FNE75XznfIE?si=Qw2E9VX9JPSSI70g, I was looking for hidden messages in the letters. :P
2024-04-30T13:51:45Z	(#am6pjbq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> To me it sounds just like Stairway to Heaven played backwards. :D
2024-04-30T16:35:12Z	(#poq3aqq) @<Anthony_Sorace http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt> Why not Go?
2024-05-01T20:41:02Z	(#poq3aqq) @<Anthony_Sorace http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt> There is no try! :D
