2022-04-02T14:36:30Z	Hi
2022-04-03T07:16:07Z	(#hfvas7a) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> haha i like the FAQ 😉
2022-04-03T09:27:29Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and @<mutefall https://twtxt.net/user/mutefall/twtxt.txt> and others. Is there somewhere I can adjust the update freq on my new pod? It seem to be very much behind twtxt.net. Like I can see the mention @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt>  in https://twtxt.net/twt/s7qszka on my own pod yet. ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/5yGD7hzjUmGv5a9fnfMe3g.png)
2022-04-03T09:51:58Z	does it work if I mention myself: @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt>
2022-04-03T09:52:08Z	(#zcap6ma) yup
2022-04-03T18:12:52Z	__Idea for events in the twtxt/yarnverse:__ 0. Just use [gath.io](//gath.io) as it is, and share the event link via twtxt 1.  Add a new feature to gath.io, so each event page will have a twtxt.txt: https://gath.io/uVA3cAckHXsRppB0sf551/twtxt.txt similar to how it already supports the fediverse `@uVA3cAckHXsRppB0sf551@gath.io` 2. Add option to signup to events with your feed URL (`neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt` or `darch.dk/twtx.txt`) to be able to comment on the events, so gath.io knows about your feed
2022-04-07T11:20:18Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> is there a way to turn off the whitelist feature for images?
2022-04-09T14:31:35Z	(#ypbpysq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I mangaged to fix it. There was still somewhere in the docker yarn.yaml that it said `twtxt.net`instead of `neotxt.dk` - Now I got nice avatars and my timeline on neotxt.dk is up to date with accounts from twtxt.net :)
2022-04-09T14:32:22Z	(#72hrtfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thx :)
2022-04-09T19:38:27Z	(#xbfjrma) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> We also call the orange thing "gulerod" (yellow-root) in danish. You call bananas for roots?
2022-04-10T09:12:27Z	(#ypbpysq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I believe `extra_hosts:` was still set to `twtxt.net`
2022-04-10T18:39:46Z	Hej @<hans https://neotxt.dk/user/hans/twtxt.txt>
2022-04-11T09:50:44Z	So anyone else up for doing a Easter hackaton this week(end)?  I would really like to work on Lists and other UI features. I got lots of ideas, but need help implementing them.  I imagine that we set up some video calls from Thursday till Monday (all holidays here in Denmark at least) and see what we can hack together:D
2022-04-11T16:38:42Z	@<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> and @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Can you help me with where  the build-in themes are stored?  ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/NkeUun2C8cBMi8ucVeDQdE.png)
2022-04-12T04:08:46Z	(#arnliya) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> ah thanks. So it is in two places, not one, that's why I did find it😉
2022-04-12T04:17:30Z	(#vnmtgkq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> the way I understand/envision list is a way to organise feed using tags or folder similar to many RSS readers. It would work like Timeline, Discover and Mentions. Down the line when we got full text search there could also be filters on any sting on a post level as well. But I guess we could do #<tags https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=tags> now already?! I got some idea for the datamodel and the GUI I would like to discuss with someone who knows what possible.
2022-04-13T16:57:29Z	(#vnmtgkq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> 5 full days off work and almost no set plans. Who is up for yarn hackatoning? What times are good for you folks?
2022-04-13T18:35:10Z	(#arnliya) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> What does `html[data-theme="simple"]` do compared to `html[data-theme="dark-classic"]` in internal/static/css/colors.css ?
2022-04-14T11:05:12Z	(#arnliya) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I kinda like it. What is the best way to set the default team for non-user to no use picoCSS, but use colors from colours.css?
2022-04-14T11:14:02Z	(#arnliya) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> and @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Also what is the proper way to change the titles from "Yarn.social Dark" and "Yarn.social Light" to something else when running yarnd via docker?  I can see the stings are defined in `active.en.toml` but I guess the are build into in binary?!
2022-04-14T14:19:30Z	testing #<tags https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=tags>

2022-04-15T05:18:42Z	(#7ssamna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> so I need compile my own binary to make this happen atm?
2022-04-15T09:17:00Z	(#7ssamna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> here ya go: https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/930
2022-04-15T09:23:24Z	(#yuoestq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and here is another one: https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/931
2022-04-16T14:39:49Z	(#tl3gdha) Yes, I have just been organizing my feeds today and trying out different readers such as MiniFlux (thanks @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> for hosting:), Selfoss, Feed-on-Feeds, fraidyc.at, and NetNewsWire. But as I talked with @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> about on the videocall I also want to use my Yarn-pod as way to read feeds, when we got the List-feature up and running.
2022-04-16T15:04:23Z	(#tl3gdha) @<mutefall https://twtxt.net/user/mutefall/twtxt.txt> what do you mean by  > aggregate via rss myself ?
2022-04-17T06:35:46Z	I looks okay on my laptop, but on my phone I looks like the JS i not loaded. Can you post a screenshot?
2022-04-17T07:05:29Z	(#5rgvxrq) Thx, it's the same in my mobile. I will take a look at it.
2022-04-17T10:22:20Z	(#tl3gdha) What happened to the feature where you could subscribe via atom to a yarn account?
2022-04-17T11:21:50Z	(#tl3gdha) Sweet🚀
2022-04-17T12:00:05Z	(#5rgvxrq) How does it look now?
2022-04-17T19:21:23Z	(#npmef2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> with the vultr yarn app, do I still need a reverse proxy like Træfik?
2022-04-18T05:38:57Z	(#4t7dyqa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what `mau` and `dau` ?
2022-04-18T05:42:54Z	(#npmef2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ah so I guess I missed the `:443` port thing🤔 I need to add the port number to the IP in my DNS (i.e. cloudflaire), right?
2022-04-18T05:44:05Z	(#5rgvxrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thanks for the hæds up
2022-04-18T06:12:51Z	(#npmef2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> hmm that's exactly what I tied but it didn't work... That is the IP without the port number 🤔
2022-04-18T08:41:37Z	(#wc33pfa) yeah, I'm having some issues with minifying the CSS compared to running my in dev-mode
2022-04-18T08:48:06Z	(#npmef2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> so it shoud be set to "Proxied" and not "DNS only" in cloudflare?!
2022-04-19T19:01:32Z	(#4t7dyqa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> also fine with me
2022-04-19T19:12:22Z	(#wc33pfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> is there an easy/propper way of changed the CSS colour scheme for users not logged into your pod? I'm currently on yarn 0.13 running in the vultr app
2022-04-20T08:28:08Z	(#wc33pfa) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> yes I did that already 😉 but I'm talking about people who just come across my pod and are not logged in. Can I use the custom CSS field to show other than the default pico/yarn colours to them?
2022-04-20T09:03:20Z	(#wc33pfa) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> Like on your pod you have set what looks like `--primary` to an orange color event for people not having an account there.
2022-04-20T11:00:28Z	(#wc33pfa) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> Thanks, yes, that was just what I was looking for👍
2022-04-20T12:28:37Z	(#wc33pfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you, and this is how it looks for my (2-4?) users:  ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/gNQPRaGRzQoLJH6XUfruZN.png)  ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/M47CAg6ww5g67XYkb8KrbF.png)
2022-04-20T12:34:17Z	(#cj6acfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> seem like twtxt.net does not whiteliste neotxt.dk as of yet
2022-04-22T07:10:49Z	(#oxrraea) Cool, is this someting that cane be used like dropbox?
2022-04-24T05:05:39Z	(#l3fhzqq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> see https://neotxt.dk/twt/cfovyhq where I list some that I been trying out.
2022-04-28T12:16:05Z	(#u5pdjka) @<prx https://si3t.ch/twtxt.txt> nice I will give this a go an maybe integrate into #<pixelblog https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=pixelblog> on [github](https://github.com/sorenpeter/pixelblog)
2022-04-30T08:14:46Z	@<prx https://si3t.ch/twtxt.txt> sure. My "band" hangs out on algorave.dk and a good friend in a jazz thing called kalaiido
2022-05-04T07:56:27Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What time of day/night is our next video call? I got some cents to add to your discussion on the list-feature aka Categorisation of feeds/users https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/937#issuecomment-11846
2022-05-04T09:13:00Z	(#gbqm4nq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I will do that👍
2022-05-04T09:14:26Z	(#gbqm4nq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Cool, that should be doable (7AM CEST)
2022-05-08T09:53:42Z	@<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> and @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Here are my ideas for a datamodel and UI for lists aka categorisation of feeds/users: https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/937#issuecomment-11967
2022-05-10T09:13:16Z	(#fgrlv3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> let me know if you need any clarifications :)
2022-05-12T03:51:17Z	(#sqpsahq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> signed up. Now I just hope I will wake up that early on Saturday 😃
2022-05-13T18:34:26Z	Why do I get `Bad request` when I try to reply to posts/yarn-treads? Like this one: https://neotxt.dk/conv/jp2bwta
2022-05-14T19:30:40Z	. ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/H2p4QotiEXoCkyuhhGZTk4.png)
2022-05-15T18:22:11Z	(#ej6bbpq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Do you mean to just refresh the page in the browser? Because I have tried it and it does not work. It seem to only happen when I try to replay
2022-05-15T18:22:53Z	(#ej6bbpq) So to post this is had to copy/past the twthash manually
2022-05-15T18:24:56Z	(#obnz45a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I hope to upgrade sometime this coming week. (Same thing for this reply - i need to copy/paste the twthash to avoid the `bad request`-error and creat a new post from the frontpage instead of in the conversation view)
2022-05-16T07:22:37Z	(#ej6bbpq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> i meant "reply"
2022-05-16T11:05:23Z	(#ej6bbpq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> maybe, but i doubt that is what happens all the time. Often it keeps the draft text from some other "session" if that makes sense and I have a suspension that this might be part of the problem. Like the hidden `(#txthash)` messing things up, maybe a JS-issue... CC: @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt>
2022-05-17T16:12:35Z	How to upgrade yarn.social running as a [vultr app](https://www.vultr.com/marketplace/apps/yarn):  - download the latest binary from https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases - `systemctl stop yarnd.service ` - `cd /usr/bin/local` - `cp yarnd yarnd_old` - upload yarnd to /usr/bin/local - `chmod +x yarnd` - `reboot`  Enjoy!
2022-05-17T17:29:45Z	(#sz5deea) @<novaburst https://twt.nfld.uk/user/novaburst/twtxt.txt> Thank you for that 👍
2022-05-17T18:32:56Z	(#qfztrga) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt>  that sound very expensive. But using a vultr VPS running the yarn app and cloudflaire can be set up fairly easy. The more pods the better 😃
2022-05-21T05:23:56Z	(#kuu4t7q) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> i read "beer" nap - still havn't had my coffee (it's 7am here)
2022-05-21T13:36:26Z	So I created a new issue on the matter of [ Multi-level navigations for making space for Lists and better UX #954 ](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/954) with a little quick mock-up of where I would like to  see the various nav-elements:  ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/UtAjUjABfxcsWqJR69g85G.png)

2022-06-04T11:53:46Z	(#qwpx7la) dunno... right now it seem i broke the CSS as well. how does neotxt.dk look at your end? it might be cloudflare caching that's the issue...

2022-06-04T13:34:07Z	Got it working now via opera's vpn ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/KPZBumF4YFwZR3WeQi9xRS.png)
2022-06-05T09:05:48Z	Pruned the cach at cloudflare and re-minified the yarn.min.js file seemed to do the trick. But now i get the "bad request" error again when i try to post via https://neotxt.dk/conv/qwpx7la to (#<qwpx7la https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=qwpx7la>)
2022-06-10T10:56:20Z	(#2yvq6ta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It could be nice if we could toggle flat view from the timeline
2022-06-10T11:00:48Z	(#jfhjnza) @<rrraksamam https://twtxt.net/user/rrraksamam/twtxt.txt> you can only delete or edit your last post. But if you delete you latest post, you can then edit/delete the second to last. Also if you selfhost your `twtxt.txt` (like I do at http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt ), you can just edit it whenever you want to. But this will break replies/treads because it based on the content of the message, and not just the URL+datetime as defined in https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/twtsubjectextension.html
2022-06-11T19:17:58Z	(#2hlggeq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> there are stateless rss-readers, that only shows you a list of feeds, and no indication about if it have been "read" or not. I'm using moonmoon at the moment, but I hope that yarn.social some day will be my stateless reader for everything
2022-06-11T19:21:23Z	(#2hlggeq) next level would be to only ofter your content via RSS: https://shinobi.website/index.txt  > A shinobi website is a text-based, RSS focused blogging "system". I put the word system in quotes since it's really just a simple bash script that converts plain text files into an RSS feed. So, it isn't an actual blogging platform or website in the traditional sense.

Jeg kan se at du har oprettet profiler både her på neotxt.dk og på twtxt.txt, korrekt? De opslagt du laver fra hver profil, vil blive gemt på dens server, men hvis folk følger din profil på andre servere, så vil dine besked også bliver vist her.

2022-09-18T06:46:04Z	(#kjsrlnq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> Cool idea
2022-09-19T22:45:02Z	I have been hacking away on replacing the PicoCSS with [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org), since it offer a much manageable set of color variables that can ease the work of making your own team a whole lot.  I have gotten to a place now with some sane default colors, so you are welcome to take it for a spin from: https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/src/branch/theme_simpleCSS  There are still some issues with the mobile menu and some side-effects of using headers in places it should not have been used in the first place.  Please let me know if this is something that you see worthy of being merged into main and what you like or dislike about it as it stands now.   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/zWpkqtRAzepjrbyEoEYbDD.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/CF7p9GRFMnCsM3Brn8G3fh.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/kW6jTrMaRG4EXHHyPwvQpG.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/BuB8myvQxThsob6SjYFuH9.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/HJnA5ZYfL2jbGy8keGAknF.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/Lur8Q9Bg5JC7vpwSPNKr3j.png)
2022-09-20T05:12:50Z	(#al2rgeq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> thank you:) you meen if there was no accent color so it would be all monochrome?  The only difference between 2nd and 4th is the accent, but you mean to have a light version with orange accent?
2022-09-20T05:28:18Z	(#al2rgeq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> thanks, yeah I also like the freshness of the blue/magenta the most. It is the the default light colors of simple.css and very similar to my colorscheme on [blog.neotxt.dk](http://blog.neotxt.dk) 😉
2022-09-20T05:31:55Z	(#al2rgeq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> oh you mean just the **icons**? Would that be the main text like the twts or do you mean the accent/link color?
2022-09-20T06:36:08Z	(#al2rgeq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> gotcha, so similar to how the `nav` elements are styled now on twtxt.net?  Actually if you look closely the icons are more yellow and the link text are orange, but I can try to make a version of the two first theme where icons and accent are the same or vrey close to the same color.
2022-09-20T16:27:56Z	(#zj3tzxq) It's homemade. And yes it is the one at https://git.mills.io/sorenpeter/neotxt_theme   You are welcome to fork it, but I will redo it when we got the new yarn_theme_simpleCSS in the main branch of yarn
2022-09-20T16:28:41Z	(#zj3tzxq) @<akoizumi https://social.kyoko-project.wer.ee/user/akoizumi/twtxt.txt> also some of the theming is done via the Poderator option to add custom css, which is a mess due to PicoCSS "design" choices
2022-09-20T18:34:56Z	(#al2rgeq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt>  Is this what you were asking for?  ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/4R9voNgsgKHS5hrqptmUJ6.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/pxBWCiXLBakFMmNKtqYkNA.png)
2022-09-20T19:46:27Z	(#al2rgeq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> The good thing is you we do not have to just pick one. The idea with themes are that people can pick what colors they want
2022-09-20T19:54:21Z	(#al2rgeq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> Ouch there is a scenario that I didn't anticipate... You might have to run you own pod to be able to change between two dark themes if the change is to be controlled automatically by your OS/browser.   Or we need to extend the option for custom CSS beyond just a primary/accent and secondary/icon color... Hmm we could add the option to just add each of those for a dark _and_ and light mode.
2022-09-20T20:11:33Z	(#al2rgeq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> Haha no worries 🤙 Maybe we will leave that [issue](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/986) for later. Just really great with all the feedback and to see that you guys want more color options 🎨
2022-09-20T21:50:40Z	(#al2rgeq) I believe I have fixed what I found of issues on the main pages, so [theme_simpleCSS](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/src/branch/theme_simpleCSS) should be ready for daily use and a merge with main soon.  One big change is that the Custom Secondary Color under Settings now control the icons and inline-code instead of Hover/Select Color as before  ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/xxU2u4Fy2hKo29Xzfd6a4B.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/XwWU73xUTnDSicdHwuup67.png)

2022-09-22T18:04:53Z	(#kqs5t5a) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Yeah I talked to the developer of picoblog via [twitter](https://twitter.com/paulglushak) and he said he would put a Apache License 2.0 on picoblog, which mean i guess pixelblog would have to use the same license since it to some extend is a fork of the former.

2022-09-22T19:40:02Z	(#bc5csba) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> that combinde could maybe be called "Chime in" in the UI

It could either be via webmetions or simply an option in the UI to email them if they have given disclose that in their twtxt.txt. There is also an option in the original spec to see who follows you in your webservers logfiles
2022-09-22T19:46:56Z	(#bc5csba) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> they are only visible in my custom theme on neotxt.dk, but if you hover the icons on twtxt.net you should see the times as well ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/TDDJoksXGwHyRPpn3PaeRk.png)

2022-10-06T05:01:35Z	(#2fkr5fq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> I kinda had the same idea for using a twtxt file for incoming comment on a blog and the people could follow that feed to see the comment.  A way to implement it would be like I did at http://algorave.dk/bbs where everyone can comment if they know know the password
2022-10-06T06:05:35Z	(#2fkr5fq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> if you can guess the password you are in. Not very secure, but maybe it does not need to be

2022-10-06T08:28:05Z	(#fv47lyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ah yeah, that's a cleaver way of doing it
2022-10-06T08:46:06Z	This is a cool way of adding commenting or a guestbook options to a webpage - if it is hosted on github, that is: https://garrit.xyz/posts/2022-10-05-simple-guestbook
2022-10-06T08:48:34Z	Interesting take on hashing. Maybe this approach can open up for allowing editing of twtxt posts without breaking the back-linking: https://matt-rickard.ghost.io/perceptual-hashing

2022-10-06T14:46:20Z	(#e2pzenq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> are you on your own pod? If you upgrade to the latest version of yarn from source it should look like this: ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/6gg553Fv3C5KJoYJM8pYLS.png)  You can also change it by targeting the element using the Custom CSS field, but I have also been thinking to change the colors myself in the new theme based on SimpleCSS

2022-10-08T06:29:06Z	(#6gdjuoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> not sure it fixed yet...
2022-10-08T12:19:34Z	(#6gdjuoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sorry to say that the issue seem to have started with your commit [ef79797f97](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/commit/ef79797f97f9123e80cb5f325f32715ccd2872c5)  When I checkout the previous commit by Tai Groot [649978bbd2](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/commit/649978bbd274fb8296705e5c62a2f0a0bb197ceb), build it and run on my server the issue with the disappearing Bookmark and Mute buttons are not there.
2022-10-10T12:34:55Z	(#6gdjuoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Not sure I know how to fix the issue, since I don't really know JS very well.
2022-10-11T19:11:42Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> here's a crude mock-up of a search interface ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/x46hkKXhRXEne6mv5S5bja.png)
2022-10-12T04:12:44Z	(#fypp3aq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> i imagine some of the filters cen be done by adding a `+author:datch` to the query.
2022-10-12T04:50:41Z	(#fypp3aq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ah okay, I imagine something like `greb author`
2022-10-12T04:52:07Z	(#fypp3aq) The filters shown will be depending on the  search results and the numbers/frequently will be used for sorting under each filter and the only show the first 3-5 names and an unfold option to get to the rest
2022-10-12T06:43:13Z	(#fypp3aq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes, I'm just dreaming big. Let's just get something working
2022-10-13T07:17:18Z	(#ldc656q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is fixed by borrowing code from picoCSS in 00-pico-tech-debt.css, but it would be nice to redo it more in line with simpleCSS (someday/maybe)
2022-10-13T09:12:02Z	(#ldc656q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I would leave it there now. Personally I'm not using link validation feature, so we could remove it of there is not objections. Regarding image view option, there are some improvements that I would like to do to how it's working atm
2022-10-14T16:49:46Z	(#y5rkw5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> great work. All booked this weekend with AFK stuff, but hope I will have time next week to do something about the UI/UX

2022-10-15T07:28:22Z	(#y5rkw5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> would i make sense to move the global search to http://search.yarn.social or get another domain for it so it is not as as tidly bound to twrxt.net?
2022-10-15T07:39:41Z	(#y5rkw5a) Down the line I like to see that the end user will be offer three leves if search:  - Personal(ized) for only searching in feeds you follow (scope: Timeline)  - Local/pod for search only feeds that are hosted or followed by other people on your home pod (scope: Discover)  - Global for searching in all indexed feed   Maybe the 2nd level can be skipped, but it might become usefulness if the network grows and we get pods with special profiles like regional ones
2022-10-15T08:04:59Z	(#y5rkw5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I do't want to split the index in 3. The first two would be on the user's home pod only, a then you would be taken to a `yarns` instance for the global search
2022-10-15T10:32:10Z	(#wv4r7cq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> right now it just part of `yarnd` right? I would make a lot of sense to have it as a separate app for deploying on other site
2022-10-15T10:58:37Z	(#kz4bgfq) @<quark https://ferengi.one/twtxt.txt> In what you do you experience the UI to have regressed?
2022-10-15T12:21:49Z	I've started working on the UI/UX of Yarn Search ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/NeRdQxRwngHPMUKrKba7MW.png)   But I would agree with @<quark https://ferengi.one/twtxt.txt> that the fuzzy search is a bit too fuzzy when `darch` gives hits likes `March`
2022-10-16T08:02:27Z	(#rxcajlq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes
2022-10-16T10:39:14Z	(#hmyzoaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> you can change all the colors in the 03-colors.css
2022-10-16T10:52:59Z	(#hmyzoaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> you can change all the colors in the 03-colors.css - or what do you mean?

2022-10-17T09:21:41Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> could this be something to consider for yarn? https://jlelse.blog/micro/2022/10/goblog-editor-sync
2022-10-18T04:28:09Z	(#wum6ztq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> not the worst
2022-10-18T04:30:17Z	(#sws5nrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes yes yes, that what I been taking about since join this network. By my idea was just to filter the feeds you already follow.  So some way of reposting or embedded posts in post could be a way to do what you are imaging.   f we get link preview in the yarn UI, like we are already offering for other sites when they post a link to a yarn post, then I see this feature not too hard to make.
2022-10-18T07:48:58Z	(#sws5nrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> hmm then i guess we need to come up with a way of showing authorship on individual post, if we are to compose new feeds based on others posts
2022-10-19T04:08:21Z	(#23bjfdq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes I think so
2022-10-19T12:01:30Z	(#sws5nrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Chould these seach-feeds just post the links to the posts that matches the searches like the way feeds.twtxt.net does it, and then it up to `yarnd` to show the preview of the post, which would be a nice feature to build anyway  `2022-10-19T13:57Z     **Yarn Search alert:** ⌘  https://neotxt.dk/twt/sws5nrq`
2022-10-19T18:56:17Z	(#hmyzoaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Okay so I noticed some issues looking at the working almond theme:   - the `--accent-bg` is too light compared to the all `#000` background, so I would suggest that it will turned down to something like `#111` and maybe also the border color to `#333`  - It seem that I have not styled the new `in-reply-to` multiline design to look right with **Compact View** turned on, so that will go on my todo-list...  - My hack to use `--code` for coloring the icons does not really make sense, when you go a make them the same color as `--accent`, so I think i will make a new `--icon` css var, which I been planing to anyhow    ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/zN9ZbTH77eaUgZdUH3AURj.png) Colors☝️ before and after 👇  ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/A2UQNdMePNEPmqzauNH83N.png)
2022-10-20T05:19:32Z	(#hmyzoaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> should we make the amoled theme the default dark yarn theme?
2022-10-20T07:10:24Z	(#sws5nrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> hmm what about that `yarnd `talks to `yarns` behind the scenes, and `yarnd `then have a timeline that is just all the know feeds (global search) and we do filtering on that one?
2022-10-20T17:18:30Z	(#hmyzoaa) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> and @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I updated the Amoled theme and added the `--icon` css var to this [PR](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/commit/0ea9f4731343b9ecca9b833ff6fc215102dc2760)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/vLjZ9CmyVNFgmmhQLMuUQS.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/UpdUnymV2tpNWyenwnpxZA.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/VVsmVvAewfG5DWVEbJ4UJi.png)   We need to rollback the [addition of the Amoled](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/commit/06f1e88186a283f532fe917b1bc9f7085bc31dae), but first when we are sure we want to do that?
2022-10-20T18:53:24Z	(#hmyzoaa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> tbh I didn't read the post before, i just needed something with `code` in it. Reading it now it quite funny
2022-10-21T04:06:34Z	(#5um7k4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> i can also just barely make out the difference tbh. In my first commit it was #<222 https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=222>, but I cange it to #<111 https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=111>, so let's go back to #<212121 https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=212121>

2022-10-22T21:14:38Z	Just came accross the #<storyofthehashtag https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=storyofthehashtag> at: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/09/how-chris-messina-got-twitter-to-use-the-hashtag.html  So right now we don't see an lot of use af #<tags https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=tags> here on yarn/twtxt. I believe it's because it not very useful atm. You can put in hashtags in your post, but there are no way of discovering other tags or see posts and treads with a tag.  I like what [Scuttlebutt](https://ssb.nz) do, when they turn the hashtags (back) into channels: ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/oaZHAtxnLawjgBatBEpRsM.png)   And with the new search #<comingsoon https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=comingsoon> I believe we can have something similar
2022-10-22T21:29:10Z	(#vkyo24q) So to begin with, is there or will there be a `list tags` option in the new search?
2022-10-22T21:55:14Z	(#uisi5sa) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> scuttlebutt is very cool indeed

2022-10-22T22:21:02Z	(#vkyo24q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> that is seem to still be a query search for when you know what tag your are looking for as I read it, not a way to list the tags that are being used

2022-10-23T10:55:31Z	(#6k4tcaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> So I did something else with the Setting page: I added tabs, which mean that I got some new issues with `<form action="/settings" ... >` since it now split into three.  I got it working now by using `id=updateSettings` in an empty form at the top, and then adding  form="updateSettings" to all the now orphaned inputs etc., but now the existing settings are not loaded into the form elements, as you can see on the radio buttons in the screenshots.  Anyhow have a go at in the new [settings_with_tabs](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/src/branch/settings_with_tabs) branch :)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/AJiRGq2yn2nLCG7xNqTg8d.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/v367C2GKk9kut2bGupd3oZ.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/4GnL7hydQs6xUVZzCGge55.png)
2022-10-23T11:08:45Z	(#6k4tcaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> one nice way to fix this would be to split up `action="/settings"` into 3 endpoints, so we chould have 3 normal forms instead of all the orphans
2022-10-23T11:44:58Z	(#6k4tcaa) ha! I think i "accidentally" fixed it, by adding `id` to all the labels, which was missing them and was not clickable.
2022-10-23T12:11:04Z	(#6k4tcaa) Hmm for some reason the Custom Secondary Colors is filled in with the content from the tagline-fields...  ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/47T6cgzYrVqkQnkwyPN8EP.png)

2022-10-24T21:49:26Z	(#6k4tcaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I didn't find a better way allow the form to work across the tabs, than what I made yesterday, so I just made some small CSS fixes and cleaned up the code a bit.  The issue with the autofill in seem to be related to my Firefox settings.  Can someone else take the  [settings_with_tabs](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/src/branch/settings_with_tabs) branch for a spin on a dev-pod, to make sure it doesn't accidentally delete the users settings or something, before I make a PR?
2022-10-25T05:32:35Z	(#6k4tcaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thanks😊 yes that was also my idea that we could reuse the design other places. If you check under Poderator on that branch you shoulde see it effects there too.   We still need to work out the mobil view for the tabs-desig - I would like it to show the tab-labels all stacked on the top so it's easier to pick the one you want to go to instead of scrolling and then clicking the next one to show.
2022-10-25T05:34:00Z	(#6k4tcaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> also was the radio buttons or check boxes emnty when you first loaded the new branch?

2022-10-28T12:44:56Z	(#b6oc3qq) @<hashrock https://twtxt.net/user/hashrock/twtxt.txt> you can edit you latest post, so that kinda works like a preview, but yes that would be a nice feature to have a proper preview before posting
2022-10-28T17:37:58Z	(#vnfboya) @<hashrock https://twtxt.net/user/hashrock/twtxt.txt> you can log in with you existing GitHub account, that's what I do
2022-11-06T08:23:21Z	(#mo4espq) @<hashrock https://twtxt.net/user/hashrock/twtxt.txt>  yes that is exactly my idea with pixelblog, and I'm up for working together on improving it or making it part of `yarnd`
2022-11-06T08:28:45Z	(#mo4espq)  one option is to make an extension for a CMS like [yellow](https://datenstrom.se/yellow/) which i been using for years and I already talked with the devs about twtxt
2022-11-06T08:32:09Z	(#mo4espq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it could look like the gallery/grid view on http://darch.dk/pixelblog and work in a similar way where each thumbnail links back to the post containing it
2022-11-06T08:34:44Z	(#yux6gca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  a sort option would be nice for newest/oldest
2022-11-06T08:39:00Z	(#efpfjgq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> sure, but first I a couple of days since I'm still traveling (will post photos soon too;)  Will you make an issue and tag me on gitea?
2022-11-06T08:39:46Z	(#bysf6ra) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> the CMS I use for www.darch.dk and blog.neotxt.dk
2022-11-06T10:31:59Z	(#bysf6ra) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> a flat files and folders CMS written in PHP, similar til WordPress but way  simpler. Does the link not work? 🤔
2022-11-06T10:58:46Z	(#yux6gca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  Can you also try to make a filter for posts containing images and other media? both markdown `![]()` and links to .png .jpg .gif etc.  Then we would already have most of what we need for a thumblr/Instagram view for yarn/twtxt
2022-11-09T21:22:39Z	(#3dgf3ma) I would suggest putteing the filters in a sidebar. With simple.css we can already use `<aside>` for this and from the new tabs in settings we can reuse the style for getting the boxes
2022-11-09T21:31:53Z	(#3dgf3ma) Something like this: ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/rnGKEKdQxFWt6hgaqqztd9.png)   ``` <main class="container float"> <aside class="filternav"> <h4>Filters</h4> <nav class="tabs"> <a href="https://twtxt.net/?f=localonly" class="current">On twtxt.net</a> <a href="https://twtxt.net/?f=noreplies">No Replies</a> <a href="https://twtxt.net/?f=nobots">Exclude Bots</a> <a href="https://twtxt.net/?f=norss">Exclude Feeds</a> <a href="https://twtxt.net/">Clear</a> </nav> </aside> ```
2022-11-09T21:53:46Z	(#3dgf3ma) @<eaplmx https://texto-plano.xyz/~eaplmx/twtxt.txt>  good idea to use check boxes, but not sure how to make it work...
2022-11-10T06:06:19Z	(#ctx4zca) you can make an raspberry pi into a fm transmitter by just attaching a wire to one of the gpio pins. i tired it and it work
2022-11-10T06:12:01Z	(#3dgf3ma) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> tooo.muutch.animaaation but otherwise cool
2022-11-10T10:46:21Z	(#owkdycq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  i also find this confusing, both the text and icons for reply and fork so I'm planning to come up with a more clear design where there might also be some visual ques to if this is a reply to the ongoing conversation or a branc/fork/sub-tread
2022-11-10T19:56:20Z	(#wgoglpq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> unfollowed https://texto-plano.xyz/~eaplmx/twtxt.txt  now
2022-11-10T21:52:34Z	(#j25cvcq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> yes that would be a nice feature. An easy way of indicating it would be a border around the avatar in a specific color -- or that might be taking too much attention. It could also be a hover/alt text
2022-11-10T22:09:19Z	(#j25cvcq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> maybe, but we already got a lot of icons in the ui. Also what would be a good icons for "you already follow this feed / you do not follow this feed" ? and thidly all icons is for actions, this would only be information.
2022-11-10T22:14:04Z	(#j25cvcq) okay, so the icons for type of feed (bot, rss, human?) could be in different colors depending on if you follow it or not: `--text-light` for not following and `--accent` if you follow them.
2022-11-11T07:18:11Z	(#j25cvcq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  yup I think that will do for now, though it is not available on mobil.
2022-11-11T07:19:36Z	(#j25cvcq)  and then this could be a reason to show the type for Normals feeds as well and then do the color thung
2022-11-11T09:57:35Z	(#eo6dbga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> that is 4 in the morning, so it will be sleeping there💤
2022-11-11T22:20:42Z	(#mo4espq) @<hashrock https://twtxt.net/user/hashrock/twtxt.txt> you can already point pixelblog to an external twtxt.txt, but generating thumbnails does only work for local files.  And for mockup take a look at: https://darch.dk/pixelblog/gallery/  But it would be nice to have a more tumblr look with thumbnails in their propper aspect ration as in your mockup above.
2022-11-11T23:09:20Z	(#eo6dbga) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I will probably be going out at that hour tomorrow. But your guys should just go ahead a have a yarn if more people can meet there
2022-11-12T07:27:51Z	@<hashrock https://twtxt.net/user/hashrock/twtxt.txt> how do I setup and start using https://github.com/anydown/kanbandown when I don't know yarn.js (not be confused with yard/twtxt;)
2022-11-13T12:21:29Z	(#qu4rdxq) It says here that you can run your own server: https://gitlab.com/jam-systems/jam
2022-11-14T09:11:16Z	(#j25cvcq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> twtxt don't have headings, so do you mean the username?
2022-11-14T19:06:00Z	[Mastodon is Email? – Email is good.](https://email-is-good.com/2022/11/14/mastodon-is-email/) and the same goes for twtxt+yarn  When I try to explain yarn.social to others i also tell them that's like email, but not sure many people get it.  What are your experience with getting others on board to yarn and twtxt?
2022-11-14T19:24:33Z	(#4ust3oa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> no, because twtxt is pull only. The comparison with email is more that is not just one server by one company, but that no one owns the platform, since it not a platform but at protocol
2022-11-15T04:42:27Z	(#pxnfqia) You could set up a RSS for your miniblog (if it's not already thee?) that people could then followed via feeds.twtxt.net
2022-11-16T19:40:44Z	(#zuhxkla) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> danke, i've fixed that now
2022-11-18T14:49:36Z	(#ahadpba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> link is not working....
2022-11-19T07:34:27Z	(#eb6oqxq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> you posted the timeslots when I was sleeping so it was a bit hard to set my alarm for 06 CET😴  I would prefer if both times lots was an hour later, but I could do both/either if I knew it 1.5 days in advance so I could plan accordingly 😊
2022-11-19T08:27:13Z	(#eb6oqxq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes, see ya later
2022-11-19T10:41:50Z	(#eb6oqxq) we can start now or in 5 min
2022-11-19T13:38:20Z	This seem to mostly apply to yarnSocial as well: [How Mastodon is different (than twitter)](https://gilest.org/mastodon.html)
2022-11-19T17:45:14Z	(#fczllqq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> do you have any always on devices in your setup? That one of my biggest concerns for me to switch from dropbox - that I would not always be working on the latest version of a file.
2022-11-20T07:05:01Z	(#2eeieda) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> hmm it doesn't seem that ladybird support CSS gird, which is was a lot of the changes/improvementsvare using instead of flexbox.
2022-11-20T18:54:31Z	New nicer looking filters with icons now online at http://neotxt.dk along with a new [PR #1081](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/pulls/1081)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/nxs3DKVZGS3W9ZXz6dQkV4.png)
2022-11-20T18:56:14Z	(#hhxkqdq) Aslo made a page on the wiki explaining how to [Update the icon font file](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/wiki/Updating-the-icon-font-file)
2022-11-22T18:17:50Z	(#rpyrpra) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I been thinking about that too at some point. I believe that was the original reason form the 140 character limit on twitter.
2022-11-24T06:17:22Z	(#wbcubwa) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> look good, great work. I'm getting a bit confused with the icons, especially the colours. If preferred is to be above available the the colour should be flipped so preferred is green and available is yellow similar to a traffic light 🚦  Doodle.com uses `(✓)` for their middle level called something like `yes if needed` vs just `✓` for `yes`
2022-11-27T06:38:26Z	(#wnvp5ja) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> wow that is a fucking goldmine of good observations working with you guys on yarn.social - especially the previous article: https://www.kooslooijesteijn.net/blog/why-is-free-open-source-software-badly-designed
2022-11-27T09:29:21Z	(#wnvp5ja) From: https://www.kooslooijesteijn.net/blog/why-is-free-open-source-software-badly-designed  > With software it’s clear: when you don’t have programmers, you don’t get a computer program. But when a team is employed to develop a product without designers, a design gets made nonetheless. Accidental design. Bad design, most likely. But with no designer around and no one listening to users, the client is not going to notice.  > (...)  > Great design isn’t done by picking up a tiny issue and creating a solution for it. It’s done by gaining deep understanding for the problems people have, the context in which they use products and by testing solutions with people. It’s labor-intensive and requires people who are engaged with their users over long periods of time.  > (...)  > In volunteer-to-volunteer situation, they just have to hope someone feels like doing it. **If the frontend developer is like, ‘Yeah, but I like it the other way’, designers are shit out of luck.**

You’re not going to get this right on your own: you need people to provide feedback and you need people who can write well, translate and present it visually.  > Even if the hands-on design work would be covered by volunteers, we need someone to make sure that it all comes together. That all that work has unity and consistency within and between products.

2022-11-27T09:50:04Z	Vote/opinion: which is the preferred or correct render of block quotes - yarnd or the yarn app? ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/cr9JbECpTwNGrnqaApSt6D.png)   ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/3Adew3qexnvCaAwtZMSVAW.png)   I would have expected it to look like it does in the app when I wrote the posts, but yarnd collapsed it allo into one blockquoute, which intrired to fix by adding `(...)`  Is this a problem with the markdown parser not being the same used in the app and in yarnd?
2022-11-27T13:37:18Z	(#da2esnq) this might be an option for yarn pods to get a a little funding
2022-11-27T17:29:47Z	(#27ednhq)  it not a trick. just a convention for splitting up quotes. if you look at the two post i may earlier today you will see what I mean
2022-11-27T18:13:59Z	(#27ednhq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> if you look at my two replies to https://neotxt.dk/conv/wnvp5ja i hope it makes sense. Looking at the raw txt that is.
2022-11-27T18:23:04Z	(#oqxwrkq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> yes that I how I think it should work too here on the web app
2022-11-27T19:15:24Z	(#vqertyq) WINAMP
2022-11-28T13:58:03Z	(#ybid3lq) @<zags https://octobloc.xyz/user/zags/twtxt.txt> i guess not, since the hash is calculated from the content of the post
2022-11-28T16:24:21Z	(#2giomoq) @<movq https://uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I think the webclient on my phone "cookie jar'ed" that mention. We need to find a way to clear the postbox so prefilled text is not carries over from difference view. Right now it seem to just store whatever. @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or others, do you have any idea how to fix this?
2022-11-29T04:27:05Z	(#xe67zvq) Interesting that they point at #<autocrypt https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=autocrypt> and #<deltachat https://neotxt.dk/search?tag=deltachat>    Not sure how the two would work together though is that is at all possible
2022-12-01T04:44:55Z	(#x7oliha) Hi @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> and thanks for letting us know. I have never noticed this, but I see it now too. What device and browser are you using?
2022-12-01T04:52:27Z	(#rgv7q3a) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> cool, how do we see the results? On mobil is looks and works fine but yeah there are stuff that can be done to improve the layout.
2022-12-01T08:25:27Z	(#x7oliha) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> thanks for that. I hope that will be easy to fix
2022-12-01T19:32:57Z	(#x7oliha) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt>  yup I just had a look at it: https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/src/branch/footer_overflow  not sure if I fixed the issue yet or just created more problems...
2022-12-01T20:41:42Z	(#x7oliha) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> try to visit my pod http://neotxt.dk and see if it's better there now
2022-12-01T20:52:10Z	(#x7oliha) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> great to hear. And yeah I know I need to fix the top banner on my server 😉
2022-12-01T21:01:16Z	(#x7oliha) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> thanks I will make a PR over the weekend then
2022-12-02T12:26:13Z	(#wzcc6pq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yes I been thinking about the same. Epecially ~~if~~ when we are to have more filter. I would go for putting the filters in an `<aside>`-menu and the make it collapsible on mobile. Maybe make a setting for pinning some filters like __Mentions__ entions and then have the other hidden under a "More..."-label
2022-12-02T17:28:50Z	(#wzcc6pq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> yes that is also a solution I've been pondering and easier to implement for now
2022-12-02T17:31:33Z	(#wzcc6pq)  seem straight forward: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_menu_horizontal_scroll.asp
2022-12-02T18:57:44Z	Are we having a video call this weekend?
2022-12-02T20:03:16Z	(#gzuilta) At 07 AM CET which should be 06 AM UTC works for me, but I'm also fine skipping it and sleeping longer on my Saturday for once like a sane person
2022-12-02T20:16:24Z	(#gzuilta) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> sure thing, see you (and other?) there!
2022-12-02T20:52:14Z	(#wzcc6pq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> good to know. And I think we can either pop out the `.filer-nav` element from `<main>` or use some absolute position to make it work. I also seen some implementations with a gradient fade to each side.
2022-12-02T21:04:17Z	(#wzcc6pq) ``` Ha! I've just noticed that code blocks already work this way and it got a nice border around it which we could render on mobile ```

2022-12-03T20:43:05Z	(#hqyfl3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes, if you don't click on either the reply or fork button, and just start typing without reading what is already in the postbox, this has happens to me several times.

2022-12-22T07:13:09Z	(#m7d2pba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ah got it. It' because I never use the window capture - only full screen or selection.

2022-12-26T09:35:24Z	(#kms34ea) I have summarized what is needed to implement lists a feature in yarn and maybe other clients too. I it broken in to steps where we need to work out step 1 (backend and data storage) before we can start to implement the UI (step 2-5): [#937 - Categorisation of feeds/users - aka. "Lists" - yarn - Mills](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/937#issuecomment-14835)  @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt/1> and other, when we got a way to store the data about list for each user and functions to view and edit them, I will continue working on the UI:)
2022-12-26T09:43:54Z	(#x7oliha) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> _and_ @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> try to visit my pod https://neotxt.dk where I'm now running the overflow_bug branch and let me know if the issue is fixed when using your phones, so I can make a PR.
2022-12-26T17:37:06Z	(#x7oliha) Added horizontal scroll for the filters now too: ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/JZ3rwdfypPPk3hGRXZCoD5.png)
2022-12-26T21:51:11Z	(#6k2pwsq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> so it doen't work or??
2022-12-26T21:51:49Z	(#6k2pwsq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> it was on someones request not that long ago
2022-12-26T22:38:54Z	(#6k2pwsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> nope, do you mean topics like https://github.com/topics/twtxt ?
2022-12-26T22:59:24Z	(#6k2pwsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ah okay, so just like using `site:` or `date:` in any mainstream search engine. Why do you bring this up here?
2022-12-26T23:00:46Z	(#6k2pwsq) or do you mean the filters in the side menu?
2022-12-26T23:11:57Z	(#6k2pwsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> so it is the dropdown feature that you like?!  Sure we can do that, but then the user have to type out what they want and it don't see that as very mobile friendly...
2022-12-26T23:19:25Z	(#6k2pwsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> so you just want a dropdown instead of a horizontal scroll? I'm not gonna do it this year, since I believe what we have now is sufficient. At least until we got lists up and running as I posted about earlier today: https://neotxt.dk/twt/vef7xva
2022-12-27T07:10:03Z	(#6k2pwsq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> also: [mobile - Filters in a horizontal scroll or in a dropdown; what is better?

2022-12-27T07:13:06Z	(#x7oliha) There is a PR waiting to be merge now [fixing the overflow causing horizontal scroll on mobile](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/pulls/1105)   It includes the horizontal scroll for filters on mobile, but it commented out in the CSS for the time being.
2022-12-27T20:46:57Z	(#6k2pwsq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> that's great and the horizontal scroll should first kick in below 740px, above that the filters simply do a line wrap as before. But I guess you already know that after trawling thought the code😉

2023-01-05T08:32:03Z	(#7ai23la) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yarnd simply does not understand markdown tables, i guess it not included in the parser.
2023-01-05T12:20:35Z	(#xzi7m6q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> no but we could make some recommendations for how clients are to deal with issues like this
2023-01-05T16:00:59Z	(#xzi7m6q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> cool, so can this be used to improve the data quality of various nicks on each pod? I don't see a `"nick":` field in the JSON
2023-01-05T16:16:50Z	(#oovemcq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm still on MacOS 11, but can you still use apps such as [Caffeine](https://intelliscapesolutions.com/apps/caffeine)?
2023-01-05T16:30:30Z	(#oovemcq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I only had MacBooks where it a reasonable feature to put the computer to sleep to conserve battery
2023-01-05T16:36:56Z	(#4kw64qq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> so anyway people should start using the longform mentions of `@nick@url` and not just `@nick` and the the client (yarnd) need to verify it and convert it to the proper mentions. Maybe even just as `@<source.url>` over `@<source.nick>`  to omitting the spreading of bad nicks. (Ref: [twtxt file — twtxt 1.3.2-dev documentation](https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/twtxtfile.html) )
2023-01-05T16:50:00Z	(#4kw64qq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> My point was also that the client should match and replace `@prologic` with `@<https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>` and prompt the use in some way if there are more than one prologic like yarnd already does with the popup and autofill.
2023-01-05T16:58:02Z	(#4kw64qq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes and leaving out the nicks which you can also not really edit when they are saved to to yarnd following list. You need to delete and re-add them. But if we get around to building something like this http://darch.dk/yarn/lists-mockup-01.html then it would be easier to fix
2023-01-05T19:54:40Z	(#5m7jmeq) New [profile_ui](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/src/branch/profile_ui) is slowing coming together: ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/Np26TCNtkZKdM94Qo8bPVD.png)
2023-01-06T09:48:54Z	(#756zhuq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> yes to what @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> said
2023-01-06T13:24:39Z	(#756zhuq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I'm no longer using my account on twtxt.net, so no real need to still follow it. I just keep it around to preserve the history and if I ever need to log in and test something on twtxt.net.
2023-01-06T13:28:37Z	(#ugq2bpq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I like the idea that you are still using the original client as a backend and `tt `is just a frontend. And would like to be able to use it one day
2023-01-06T13:40:44Z	(#ugq2bpq)  but I do get that you want to build something better
2023-01-07T08:08:26Z	(#mf4kvaa) It is not all twtxt.txt file that adhere to having a `nick = ` or `url =` field int them, so the only information we can be sure of is a URL to where the twtxt.txt is served from. That leads to using a domain+path-to-twtxt.txt as be most unambiguous identification and also how the original `@<URL>` mention are defined in line with the indieweb way of using a domain as id. But with muti-user pods this get messing with urls like `https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.net`, when it would be much nicer if we had `http://darch.neotxt.dk/twtxt.txt` like on https://darch.neocities.org/twtxt.txt and then we could omit the `/twtxt.txt` in daily conversation. `</ramble>`
2023-01-07T08:11:52Z	(#4g3egda) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> agree so much with these problems. When it looks like an e-mail, but is not, that will confuse the hell out of most people compared to a (sub.)domain syntax.

2023-01-09T05:37:55Z	(#5m7jmeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I could use some help in figuring out how to only show the homepod and RSS link if it is actually there. Is there as way to know in yarnd if the feed is on an another pod or if it is self hosted and does not have RSS or profile page?
2023-01-09T09:09:29Z	(#5m7jmeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  and that will not just give me internal users instead?
2023-01-09T10:22:08Z	(#5m7jmeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I need to filter out profiles or feeds that are not on any pod, but selfhosted like with lyse, movq and my own at http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt, since these does not have a rss/atom feed (https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/atom.xml) or a profile page (https://neotxt.dk/user/darch) and it therefor makes no sense to show links pointing to 404
2023-01-09T12:31:20Z	(#5m7jmeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> so you don't think we can test for it in any way? Like there are some backend communication happening between pods, right?
2023-01-09T17:44:08Z	(#5m7jmeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> fair enough. I will find a way to design around it then
2023-01-09T19:27:34Z	(#5m7jmeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think i found a hack: `{{ if not (eq $.Profile.NFollowers 0) }}`

2023-01-10T08:37:45Z	(#hv772iq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes that is about right
2023-01-10T08:56:56Z	(#hv772iq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> a what?
2023-01-10T12:43:11Z	(#ob3tdza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> So each user on a pod would no even be able to the list of who follows them? Or is it just the counter you want to get rid of? And both for Followers and Following?

2023-01-11T05:36:24Z	(#ob3tdza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> so will you still be able to see who follows you? But other users/guests will not be able to see a followers list fo other user besides themselves?
2023-01-11T08:08:58Z	(#ob3tdza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I can live with that. And it's also more in line with the "privacy-first focus" of yarn.social.

2023-01-18T20:49:28Z	(#y463i3a) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> ah okay, so nothing to do with the horizontal scroll. Thanks for notices and bringing to attention
2023-01-18T20:58:12Z	(#y463i3a) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> you did not. i just didn't notice it was not the same tread.
2023-01-18T21:05:55Z	(#vopoy2q) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> what do you mean with "content creation" ?
2023-01-18T21:15:23Z	(#cgqn6wq) This is also how I mosty been working with all the UI design I have been doing for yarn social
2023-01-21T04:57:08Z	(#mfyoqpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> will bebther shortly. Just need my  ☕ and breakfast
2023-01-21T07:08:08Z	(#feqgkqa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> and @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what version of Safari are you guys using? On my MacBook im stuck on Safarie 15, but in Safari 16`overflow-clip` is supported and sounds like something that could fix the unwanted horizontal scrolling issue: https://kilianvalkhof.com/2022/css-html/do-you-know-about-overflow-clip/
2023-01-21T08:03:44Z	(#feqgkqa) [(maybe) fixed the overflow issue on safari · f1d4b6a0f2 - yarn - Mills](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/commit/f1d4b6a0f245b338e4892c96ffa5a070d804d2fc) It live on neotxt.dk so i will open up for registation today, if anyone with an iOS want to test it

2023-01-21T17:53:33Z	(#fzu257a) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> great, glad to hear. Then @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> just needs to merge the pr and update his pod for bender to be a happy 🤖

2023-01-22T05:44:19Z	(#fzu257a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> you are welcome 😊
2023-01-24T09:28:43Z	(#qvmpv3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Would it make more sense to put it under Settings? I think it is a waste of space to have a dedicated icon in the topnav for something that most people would not be using on a daily basis.
2023-01-24T12:33:43Z	(#qvmpv3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yes I have tried to have the avatar in the top right in an earlier design, but it still needs some work - especially on mobile (not shown) ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/gJsBmUbAdhVLGPSq44LCrZ.png)
2023-01-24T12:51:51Z	(#qvmpv3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes I also made something like that once way way back😉

2023-01-25T06:36:37Z	(#qvmpv3a) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> I have also played with idea about splitting up the navigation into a pod level and user level. And interesting idea to have a bottom navbar for mobile.
2023-01-26T19:15:24Z	(#qvmpv3a) How about putting the logout under settings like this? ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/RF4mnsYjGgATHbeHMCwxj3.png)
2023-01-26T19:33:51Z	(#qvmpv3a) And now also the user's avarar instead of the profile icon: ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/WJuJEMw44fCD4LcubUYz49.png)
2023-01-27T08:05:17Z	(#qvmpv3a) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> so align the logout to the right maybe?
2023-01-27T08:07:17Z	(#jaidpfa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> in what way?
2023-01-27T08:10:56Z	(#y4bsmja) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>   - I tried with the username instead of "profile", but year we can do that. - before we make a dropdown we need to think how that should work on mobile
2023-01-27T08:40:02Z	(#y4bsmja) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yeah we can do something like that for the mobile-web version as well
2023-01-27T15:52:15Z	(#qvmpv3a) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> no idea for mobile (yet). But we could also use different colors for the logout. Like we used to have a secondary (grey) color for settings and logout, before I came in and messed with the css 😅
2023-01-29T08:09:02Z	(#vc6fcta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> to combat spam and badly implement clients? Is the issue really that big?  Also it cloud be turned on/off under the poderator settings, maybe as a feature flag
2023-01-29T08:35:30Z	(#vc6fcta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> then what is the reason then?
2023-01-29T09:24:50Z	(#peg6yga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm not a big fan of dropshadows tbh. Why the hover effect? And the use of a button design for Reply, Yarn, Mute and bookmarks, become a bit to cluttered for my minimalist taste. But good to see you exploring CSS :)
2023-03-01T11:28:23Z	(#6kmegzq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hard if you are a bot...
2023-03-01T11:33:20Z	(#ahw6eha) Guess I need to update my pod then, but it still say Success when adding `https://mastodon.ar.al/@aral` as a new feed.
2023-03-01T12:19:04Z	(#jm3kkrq) @<screem https://twtxt.net/user/screem/twtxt.txt> What are you plans for a "nice(r) UI/UX"? Is it for the web or app version?
2023-03-11T13:41:19Z	(#zbsrabq) I don't like where this is going with a push-model like Activity Pub being mixed up with yarn social. Activity Pub might be all for **freedom of speech**, but with the issue that @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> outline the is a real potential of it turning into **freedom of shouting**.  What I really like about twtxt is that is based on a principle of **freedom to listen**  where you can chose who to follow and are not force-fed someone else's agenda, that you don't care about or want to deal with.
2023-03-12T09:04:13Z	(#fdscdpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> How do I turn these notifications off?  I also believe it should be it's own bot 🤖 instead of using the support-account
2023-03-12T10:42:05Z	(#6awomaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> works now after upgrading. Super cool feature
2023-03-12T10:42:41Z	(#fdscdpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> How was this a bug?
2023-03-12T10:46:01Z	(#6awomaa) Let's see how it handles soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/darchdk/clamsong
2023-03-12T11:02:49Z	(#c43rorq) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Yes, an option for deliberate cross-posting or [POSSE the IndieWeb way](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) is more appealing to me also to keep yarn.social feeling light and clean. In that way your twtxt feed would be the backbone of your own site and then have some middle-ware, which cross-post to your mastodon account and whatever service you fancy to use:  ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/zvRu5G5uPJKbJTERCxHyYF.png)
2023-03-12T11:14:44Z	(#6awomaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It looks and works fine at my end (the sounds are suppose to be weird ;)
2023-03-12T11:16:08Z	(#kq4353a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Agree 💯 (which should not suppose you after our talk yesterday)
2023-03-12T11:42:22Z	(#kq4353a) Looking at the IndieWeb service of Bridgy there might be a fairly easy way of connecing ones yarn-profile to ones mastodon via: [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/)
2023-03-12T11:46:53Z	(#kq4353a) And quote of the day from [On POSSE and IndieWeb | Joel Auterson](https://www.joelotter.com/posts/2023/03/indieweb/)  > I’ve largely avoided Twitter since Space Karen took over
2023-03-12T12:03:23Z	(#kq4353a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Really? You can't `telsa` who it is?
2023-03-12T12:05:10Z	(#z2s376a) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> So you want a gallery view of all you uploaded media?
2023-03-12T12:06:01Z	(#kq4353a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> but you do know who bought twitter last year?
2023-03-12T12:09:11Z	(#pl6ggrq) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> not for syndicating/re-posting your posts from a yarn social to other platforms. But I guess the might already be some indieweb tools for taking in a RSS-feed and posting it to other places.
2023-03-12T12:12:32Z	(#6awomaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I just copied it from: [#1135 - Add support for converting URL into embed code - yarn - Mills](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/pulls/1135)

2023-03-27T07:25:22Z	(#xi2yuya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Then it should only be `filters_` since we don't have `and_lists` yet😅  But there are still an inconsistency with what you get with the mentions-filter vs. the` /mentions` page.  ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/4UBZCtrSLLQ7qLgi7rXmUF.png) ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/dxbd56bGmVjGczNue8Bjp6.png) I'm voting for removing the mentions-filter and keeping the `/mentions` page, since the latter shows the latest mentions and I like to have it as a top-level view: ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/MVcDuycxkC8WB65Tx2g944.png)    And yes, where do we want the logout button instead?
2023-03-27T08:27:12Z	(#xi2yuya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I got an idea for splitting up the feature under `/feed` and move it to either `/discover` and `/settings` which will free up a slot for `/logout` in the topnav - how does that sound?

2023-04-16T07:56:13Z	(#gjst6xa) I don't buy jan6's premise that twts with markdown and image links is hard to read. Markdown came out of how people simulated typeset text in plain text and the URL part of links to images and others resources are also easy for humans to read and parse.  Multi-line is another matter, but I also never used the original client. I guess it could have been implemented in a was that would not break other clients. Using something like `--` or just two space at the end of a line like in markdown would also work.
2023-04-16T08:03:58Z	(#gjst6xa) This is a nice idea: [Suggestion: a convention for multiline statuses (line breaks) · Issue #157 · buckket/twtxt](https://github.com/buckket/twtxt/issues/157) -- But it would break out treading model with `(#hash)`
2023-04-16T10:14:43Z	(#twfherq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> Also considering the original tagline of twtxt:  > twtxt is a decentralised, minimalist microblogging service for __hackers__.  if a hacker can't handle some markdown and urls in their microblogging, then user != hacker
2023-04-17T15:05:21Z	(#oyi5iua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Having to deal with json and cryptography is not very appealing to me. It's the simplicity and hackability of twtxt.txt that I'm drawn by. That you can in fact handwrite your posts and you can throw pretty much anything at it after the datetime+tab and it still being somewhat human readable and work in most clients. If you do something that a client does not like, then you will have to take up the debate with the devs or make your own. And if people like some features that you invented, then your new client might get more users, or your end up doing something just or for yourself.
2023-04-18T15:25:23Z	(#54piw5q) I'm with @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>  here. Let's enjoy our freedom to listen i.e. not pay too much attention to people how argue for the sake of arguing.  A way around their criticism choud be to put a disclaimer in our twtxt.txts stating that this feed uses features that might not be compatible with some clients. Like the old "Best viewed in Netscape"-icons
2023-04-18T15:45:12Z	(#54piw5q) The "problem" as I see it is not technical, but social, so we should try to approach solving it according.
2023-04-18T17:44:58Z	(#aj6qgoa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> thanks for bringing it to my attention. I have unfollowed your archive feed now

2023-04-24T10:47:39Z	An idea for helping humans and machines understand when a twtxt-feed are using some of the yarn.social extensions by applying a mix of a [hash-bang](hashbang) and a [DTD](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp) to the first line of the txt-file:  ```#! DOCTYPE = twtxt (https://twtxt.readthedocs.io) with extension for multi-line and conversation treading from Yarn.social (https://dev.twtxt.net)```  It would be nice if the link to the extension could be to `dev.yarn.social`, `docs.yarn.social` or similar instead of `dev.twtxt.net` to make it less confusing.
2023-04-24T12:25:46Z	(#yrhfw7q) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> obrigado 🙏

2023-04-24T23:15:38Z	(#gfhperq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think both me and @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> are both only talking about getting a delete bottom, not edit besides on the latest post.  UI wise I would only put it under one's own profile or even only under settings, so it will.

2023-04-25T13:11:16Z	(#rjpq7la) @<kevin https://oh.mg/text/twtxt.txt> 🤩 not sure about the view for individual post... Will you open at issue on github about it?
2023-04-25T14:53:09Z	(#yrhfw7q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> i don't have much more than this. But I agree to keep it simple. I like your approach.
2023-04-25T18:12:55Z	(#rjpq7la) Ah, I what the problem is now: You are using [+00:00](https://sus.fr/twtxt.txt) instead of [Z](http://www.darch.dk/twtxt.txt) in the end of the datetime. I'm sure `+00:00` can be supported as well as `Z`, but if you are up for it take a look at the source code if you are not allergenic to PHP
2023-04-25T18:14:33Z	(#rjpq7la) If you delete the `+00:00` part form the URL it works: https://sus.fr/en/social/twtxt/?id=2021-08-02T19:02:37
2023-04-26T09:02:58Z	(#yrhfw7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Come to think about it, I'm more in favor of @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> 's approach; Make it human readable with relevant links and not do anything specific for the machines. This is almost already the case for [twtxt.txt ](https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt) served by yarnd, we just need to add a line to the Yarn.social section explaining about the extensions.
2023-04-26T09:55:03Z	(#rsdxtda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> yes, just build it on a dev environment and uploaded the files to my website before uploading the files to GitHub. I got it running on http://darch.dk/social
2023-04-26T10:56:16Z	(#gic5j4q) @<chunkimo https://twtxt.net/user/chunkimo/twtxt.txt> It's not that much work to setup a pod, but selfhosting your twtxt.txt is easier, but then you will be lacking a UI for reading and posting.  I'm self-hosting [this feed](http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt) and displaying it on my site and got a post and image upload feature going using my own php-tools. You can learn more about it on http://darch.dk/social  There are also terminal base solicitous, such as @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>'s [jenny ](https://uninformativ.de/git/jenny)and @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>'s [tt](https://git.isobeef.org/lyse/tt)
2023-04-26T12:23:39Z	(#rjpq7la) @<kevin https://oh.mg/text/twtxt.txt> All right so the problem is that `+` are converted to spaces in URLs.  It would be better if you used `Z` instead of `+00:00` in your twtxt.txt, but editing this for existing posts will break threading (which you do not seem to use anyway).  I can also try to make a fix, so `+00:00` is stripped from the links.
2023-04-26T18:05:46Z	(#rjpq7la) Should be fixed now in and can be downloaded from: https://github.com/sorenpeter/yellow-twtxt

2023-09-09T20:46:06Z	(#jvs2zmq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> not sure I follow?  There is not metadata extension for lists just yet, but my idea is to have lines like this in your main twtxt.txt: `# list = Name of List https://darch.dk/twtxt-lists/twtxt-feeds_by_me.txt`.  Each list-file is then just simply as list of feeds like this: `# follow = darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt`
2023-09-11T07:54:24Z	(#jvs2zmq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> My idea is that lists can be both private and public, so you can share as list of curated feeds on a specific topic with others and also have a private list of feeds you don't want the world to know that you are reading. Making it work as a public format first was the easiest to do on top of twtxt-php.

2023-11-19T11:51:26Z	(#5rrjaoa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I'm also on the e-mail wagon here. On http://darch.dk/timeline/conv/oe3howa I have added a "Comment via email" botten if uses are not logged in. This feature could be extend to other places in the various UIs. Like we already got the "Does not follow your" / "Follow you" on the profile page in yarnd, so this detection could be used to sugget the user to email that person, when mentioning them.
2023-11-20T05:03:39Z	(#plb77ba) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> hmm yeah, also not sure how this should work for multi-user pods. It should only trigger an email when it show that they do not follow you and, it should not be an automatic one. If spam becomes an issue you could use a forward email address for this feature.
2023-11-20T13:55:48Z	(#plb77ba) I have added a webmention endpoint to https://darch.dk using https://webmention.io - let see if it work from neotxt.dk to @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt>
2023-11-20T19:06:28Z	(#3x6bsna) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> nope
2023-11-20T20:23:47Z	(#3x6bsna) But I manged to send myself a webmetion using `curl -i -d "source=http://algorave.dk&target=http://darch.dk" https://webmention.io/darch.dk/webmention` since I got a link on algorave.dk to darch.dk  @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> is there a feature flag to add for webmention support or how does it work? I excepted if I mentioned my feed on darch.dk @<sorenpeter https://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> then it would send a webmention to that domain, but where is the link on the yarn pod, that confirms the mention?  EDIT: I found this 7 months old issue: [#1156 - Webmention: a source doesn't mention the target - yarn - Mills](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/1156)
2023-11-22T04:22:26Z	(#cef4pvq) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> cool, how you you like it? (And sh!t now I have to make sure it works, not just for me;)
2023-11-23T06:19:28Z	(#3x6bsna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> here is your reminder in form of my [Notes on Webmetions for Twtxt](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Notes-on-Webmetions-for-Twtxt--CERHmQF8iG4g~nRBmeyZM1ugAQ-Eg0T7WqsMsMrZ5rCrZj6N)
2023-11-23T08:53:42Z	(#3x6bsna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> To outline what is needed for implementing webmetnion in a twtxt-webapp like twtxt-php/timeline or yarnd
2023-11-23T11:07:07Z	(#3x6bsna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm trying to figure out how it works to begin with and how I can make it work with my own domain http://darch.dk -- See my questions above in https://neotxt.dk/conv/3x6bsna#jlrsduq
2023-11-23T21:01:40Z	(#3x6bsna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> So I had a look at the yarnd source code, but can't say that I'm much wiser on how it send out webmention or how to send them to a yarnd pod. Can you break it down?
2023-11-23T22:03:25Z	(#3x6bsna) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> thank you, but does it only work between yarnd pods or also to endpoints like https://webmention.io and does it it detect that I declared such an endpoint on darch.dk when someone mentions @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> ?
2023-11-24T23:08:13Z	(#fhf5c7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> i am, but closed open registration long along, so don't think anyone uses neotxt besides me. And with Twtxt-php/timeline I'm getting closer to pulling the plug now I got a working alternative.
2023-11-25T09:40:31Z	(#3x6bsna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it does not😢
2023-11-25T10:55:23Z	(#3x6bsna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> a link header where? It also need a link from here back to the link referred in the webmention like this http://darch.dk/social/ and @<that http://darch.dk/social/> might work
2023-11-25T10:56:41Z	(#3x6bsna) Jibii!  ![](https://neotxt.dk/media/6SjQspG9kZqW8HDkRPktvZ.png)
2023-11-25T10:58:04Z	(#3x6bsna) So this was right all along: [#1156 - Webmention: a source doesn't mention the target - yarn - Mills](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/1156)
2023-11-25T13:49:16Z	(#3x6bsna) Yarns does not generate a link back to the site that is being mentioned (eg. `<a href="http://darch.dk/social">look here</a>`) which is needed for validating that it is indeed a real webmention, ant not just spam. Try rereading the specs😉
2023-11-25T15:24:24Z	(#3x6bsna) It need to be a proper link to the domain. And mention is linking to a profile page on the pod, so it doesn't validate.
