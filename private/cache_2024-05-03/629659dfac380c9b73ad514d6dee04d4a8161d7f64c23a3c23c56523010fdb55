2020-09-30T12:50:42Z	Sitting at the bar, wondering what Twt is.
2020-09-30T12:55:54Z	![](https://twtxt.net/media/kwbQwQzqtYA2LeZcrrTzCn)
2020-11-04T03:07:29Z	Just installed the Goryon app. It's looking good. Wish it was on F-Droid :P
2020-11-04T12:47:22Z	@<dooven https://twtxt.net/user/dooven/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<db5icuq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=db5icuq>) nice one :D
2020-11-04T12:47:55Z	@<korynunn https://twtxt.net/user/korynunn/twtxt.txt> (#<olmnajq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=olmnajq>) as a non Aussie I still found it quite funny, despite not knowing who that guy is
2020-11-05T03:14:54Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I tried your ulinux and managed to get it running on vultr. Really fast, not just to boot, but running commands. I see it comes with box, but also supports docker. How do you install docker on it?
2020-11-05T05:19:46Z	Pretty cool little idea: https://ugliest.app/  Shame it's not open source but I bet it'd be pretty easy to implement.
2020-11-05T10:06:57Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<kosjbnq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=kosjbnq>) I just copied some of their example docs and ended up with: https://ugliest.app/l/30a08f20-1264-437c-aed2-b3d892513fc5/test  I like the simplicity. It's very centralised though. I wonder if there's a federated or decentralised way of doing this (without going down the block chain path).
2020-11-08T00:23:11Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<kakg74a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=kakg74a>) Yeah seriously loving the idea of ulinux. I actually brought it up on Vultr last week and it was lightening fast. I've always wants an OS with "NOTHING" on it, apart from containers. But you always end up getting "freebies", like systemd, video drivers, etc. I got stumped with installing go, but I see you did a commit a few days ago. Will try again...
2020-11-08T00:25:27Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<kosjbnq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=kosjbnq>) I think for centralised services I would rather use render.com, vercel, heroku or even google app engine. Or even better, puzed when I finally get it stable :P
2020-11-08T02:26:26Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<5ay47yq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=5ay47yq>) Done! I think.
2020-11-08T06:03:34Z	(#<5ay47yq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=5ay47yq>) I didn't really notice before :P But yeah, it seems crisp :)
2020-11-08T12:37:32Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<febk7dq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=febk7dq>) Nice one. I'm building now...
2020-11-11T04:39:30Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<g5mw7za https://twtxt.net/search?tag=g5mw7za>) yeah that alley is scary as hell. I constantly worry that door is gonna slam into me.
2020-11-11T22:17:39Z	@<deebs https://twtxt.net/user/deebs/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<4umo5kq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=4umo5kq>) that looks really slick. I wondee how it sends SMS. twilio?
2020-11-12T11:10:43Z	So I was just about to install proxmox on my machine, then realised there's no way to encrypt the hard drive (using their ISO installer). Is there a way to encrypt the hard drive after installation?
2020-11-12T11:49:07Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<d4tbuya https://twtxt.net/search?tag=d4tbuya>) Yeah I saw that thread but it's too complicated. I want to encrypt the whole OS disk. I just ask for too much :P
2020-11-16T13:50:17Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<mgeijyq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=mgeijyq>) That's seems amazing. So at a very basic level, I could build a "Hello World" app in go, and have my OS/VM/(laptop one day :P) boot straight to it? Although my Go isn't so good, and that does seem like a large project. Seems actively maintained though.
2020-11-16T13:51:44Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<pxf2qpq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=pxf2qpq>) THIS! It looks perfect. Was just about to go to bed, but thought I'd check this out before. I feel this was a mistake, as I'm not gonna try and spin this up on vultr lol
2020-11-16T14:04:03Z	(#<pxf2qpq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=pxf2qpq>) Hmm, disappointing. It installed perfectly, fast, very intuitive. I ran the command, it seemed to connect for a minute, then "Destination host unreachable". I also couldn't really understand how to "give" my VM an ip address. I need to do more reading I think.
2020-11-18T21:11:14Z	So I was hoping to spin up a large 24 CPU server on vultr for only a few minutes to see if building ulinux could be done extremely fast.  But I'm not allowed to create it because it goes over my allowed "monthly" limit.  So, I asked for the limit to be increased.  Support gets back to me, saying I can't get the limit increased until I'm using my current limit.  I'm trying the imagine the scenario below:  Mark: hello bartender, may I have 1 IPA please?  Bartender: sorry sir, we can't give you an IPA until you've drank at least 5 Heineken  Mark: Oh no, I really don't want Heineken. I have no use for it. It's too weak and tastes like urine.  Bartender: I'm sorry sir. You must buy the Heineken before we can serve you the good beers.  I hope one day my business makes so much money I can turn away paying customers.
2020-11-21T03:59:14Z	@<oevl https://twtxt.net/user/oevl/twtxt.txt> (#<aepd6nq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=aepd6nq>) yeah that was the same as me, I didn't add go to my path. once I did, it installed smoothly.
2020-11-21T23:18:17Z	(#<bpsds4a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=bpsds4a>) This is cool. Was it easy enough to port this to golang?
2020-11-21T23:47:40Z	(#<bpsds4a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=bpsds4a>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm absolutely in love with `box`. I feel like this, along with ulinux, is something I've wanted for years. I don't want/need/use 90% of the features of docker or linux.
2020-12-05T08:24:22Z	(#<qh2d56q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=qh2d56q>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> that's awesome James. I've only tried archery once and failed miserably.
2020-12-05T08:42:43Z	This is great, I've just seen HiFive have released their Unmatched ITX board: https://www.crowdsupply.com/sifive/hifive-unmatched  While the specs are still quite poor compared to Intel and even ARM, the progress seems great. 500mhz to 1.5ghz in just over a year.  For some background, RISC-V is an open source. free (as in freedom) architecture that should facilitate more open hardware.
2021-07-04T08:13:41Z	(#<rh56t3a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=rh56t3a>) @lyse @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Done, I put a loading spinner against each file.
2021-07-04T08:14:31Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<xv2o3ua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=xv2o3ua>) I'm very interested James if they're taking my AGPL code bases and not releasing their own source code.
2021-07-04T08:15:35Z	@movq @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<xv2o3ua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=xv2o3ua>) Yeah, you can still use github for discovery if you ever want. Just goto github.com/trending or search without actually signing in. But yeah, I think other sources are way better for discovery.
2021-07-04T08:17:22Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @movq (#<xv2o3ua https://twtxt.net/search?tag=xv2o3ua>) James I'd be really interested in how you got fbox out to so many people so quick. You launched it only a day ago and already 17 stars and some great interest. Do you publish to other posts, or have you just grown your github followers?
2021-08-13T04:46:13Z	I really hate CAPTCHA's. They should be illegal on accessibility (and ethical) grounds.  I use DuckDuckGo for more of my searches, but sometimes I'm lazy and use the !g hash bang to just redirect me to Google. But most of the times Google wants me to fill in a CAPTCHA.  That means I lose my search term and have to type it in again, or just solve it.  But no more! I have made a simple extensi that puts your query into another search engine.  https://github.com/markwylde/google-to-ddg  ![captchas](https://github.com/markwylde/google-to-ddg/raw/master/screenshot.png)
2021-08-13T04:48:57Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @maya (#<whhtila https://twtxt.net/search?tag=whhtila>) It's crazy. The best one yet is Netflix. They block paying customers from viewing their content, if it's not available in that country. Paying customers.  The big media corps are just hanging on by threads to their old fashioned ways.  https://www.vpncompare.co.uk/netflix-vpn-crackdown/
2021-08-13T04:49:16Z	@<markwylde https://twtxt.net/user/markwylde/twtxt.txt> (#<mfmgkmq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=mfmgkmq>) Sorry about the github @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> :P
2021-08-13T04:52:20Z	(#<amuk2ja https://twtxt.net/search?tag=amuk2ja>) @jlj @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @osnews It would be a really good move, but I think Apple will resist this like the plague.  An even better move would be to just keep their Safari browser up to date with the web standards from at least 3 years ago. From my perspective, the only time I ever need an actual App, is for Push Notifications or File API access.  The only reason you should "need" to be in the App Store, is if you want Apple to market your app. If you are happy to market your "app" yourself (by that I mean Progressive Web App), then you shouldn't need Apple.
2021-08-14T11:01:10Z	(#<mfmgkmq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=mfmgkmq>) @lyse Probably :P But for !g is actually a duckduckgo thing. They have a bunch of them. So if you are on duckduckgo.com things like this work:  "!yt testing" => https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=testing "!g testing" => https://www.google.com/search?q=testing "!b testing" => https://www.bing.com/search?q=testing  More here: https://duckduckgo.com/bang
2021-08-22T03:53:56Z	Really interesting idea. My domain registrar only allows a god mode API token. I feel really scared having that on a server somewhere. This could really help secure the certificate renewal process.  https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/DNS-alias-mode
2021-09-12T13:31:10Z	@<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> @<brasshopper https://twtxt.net/user/brasshopper/twtxt.txt> @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<bkydgsq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=bkydgsq>) I completely agree. I loved the whole idea/concept of scuttlebutt, and the fact that you don't even need to be connected to the internet to make it work.  But the client is slow and bloated. Syncing would frequently make my laptop fans go mad.  I looked into implementing a lightweight client for it, but the rabbit hole was too deep when reading about the protocol and how everything was stitched together.
2021-09-15T07:34:31Z	(#<ahbigzq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ahbigzq>) Ahh just testing the new Fork feature!
2021-09-15T12:39:42Z	(#<mbc2l4a https://twtxt.net/search?tag=mbc2l4a>) Really simple change, but I think it worked well. I would love to have a highlight/active class on the current sort, so I could underline it or add an up/down arrow. But wasn't sure how the go template literal stuff worked.
2021-09-15T20:45:08Z	(#<oat4yva https://twtxt.net/search?tag=oat4yva>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Yeah it's a tricky one. If you are using React with Hooks (not all the class based rubbish), it's actually alright. Have a look at the below.  It's just when compared to something like [MithrilJS](https://mithril.js.org/), it's very complicated and slow. But it's definitely the lesser of the evils (popular frameworks/libraries) out there.  But to answer why everybody is doing it, I think it's community, ecosystem and echo chambers.
2021-09-15T20:45:14Z	(#<oat4yva https://twtxt.net/search?tag=oat4yva>) ![screenshot of react demo](https://twtxt.net/media/eGCVVvG4heJmYLhqKGNAjB)   Play here: [https://tinyurl.com/25h7fjk9](https://tinyurl.com/25h7fjk9)
2021-09-15T21:03:53Z	@<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#<oat4yva https://twtxt.net/search?tag=oat4yva>) Yeah, Mithril is actually based off hyperscript. You should check it out.  I used Riot for a bit and it was alright, but again with the transpiler tag file syntax, it just gets needlessly complex. It's actually what introduced me to [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/).
2021-09-15T21:08:14Z	> I prefer the ARM version  @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#<zbdjjsq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=zbdjjsq>) Do they have an ARM version? I couldn't see it on their website. Unfortunately, I think this is the only option for those who want an ARM laptop, and care about their security/privacy: https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/
2021-09-15T21:14:35Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<aikugtq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=aikugtq>) Nope, it's just not powerful enough for daily use. I have the [sytem75 Oryx Pro](https://system76.com/laptops/oryx). Best laptop I've ever had. But it's still Intel :(
2021-09-18T00:32:13Z	(#<5p7t4xq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=5p7t4xq>) @<brasshopper https://twtxt.net/user/brasshopper/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I read something years ago online that says we all should do a thought experiment. When reading a newspaper, we might see on one page something about a domain we are an expert in. We'll instantly think "this is complete bullshit, and wrong in every way". But then we'll turn the page and read something we know much less about, and take the article as scientific fact.  My take away is that basically all of mainstream news/media is entertainment, and not actual news. I ignore most of it.
2021-09-18T00:34:09Z	@<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @jlj (#<qc5b6ba https://twtxt.net/search?tag=qc5b6ba>) I'm not sure @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt>, but I've never actually used tilde. I like the concept, and a quick look at the homepage and it looks alright in quality. I'll try adding it to my daily reads for a bit.
2021-12-19T22:56:23Z	(#wv47yyq) Hey @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Haven't signed in on here for a while :( New theme is looking cool! I should be more active in the future once I've settled back in the UK and got our own place. Housing market's still nuts over here :(
2021-12-19T22:59:44Z	(#di4txra) Honestly, what a mess :( Very disappointing the way the world seems to be heading.
2021-12-19T23:03:35Z	(#rylp6xa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> +1 for the VSCodium. VSCode has too much spyware in it.
2021-12-19T23:05:47Z	(#warnokq) Woohoo! 🥳️
2021-12-20T22:04:38Z	(#warnokq) Haha @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> sometimes it just takes a fresh pair of eyes :P
2021-12-20T22:11:16Z	(#e2xipiq) Looks good to me on Chrome Desktop (using mobile mode) 🤔   ![](https://twtxt.net/media/iMKFa9TzytTrWwax8TvJxE)
2021-12-25T15:03:29Z	Merry Christmas everyone! Hope you're all enjoying your time with friends/family :)
2021-12-31T09:10:36Z	(#vgxay4a) Nicely said @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> All this is doing is showing how trash the web is.  Although, I think the problem also stems from web browsers not doing enough to sandbox domains. A huge benefit of web and the web browser, is that you can go to untrusted websites, and not have it compromise/track/monitor/leak info to other sites/app on your device.  Third party cookies should never have been a thing.
2021-12-31T11:35:18Z	(#7ee3vzq) Yeah the day's just starting for us in the UK :P
2022-01-15T20:55:20Z	> Now your website will seem like it was made by a PRO  I'm in tears. I just had to share this one. https://hiccupfx.telnet.asia/
2022-01-16T18:14:46Z	(#e2sd5pq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> for me the site loads so fast I can't notice a single layout shift :P Just give all `img` a `width` and `height`.
2022-01-17T21:23:45Z	Well, in the latest game of "Which of the UK and Australia is worse?", UK scores some points: https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/revealed-uk-government-publicity-blitz-to-undermine-privacy-encryption-1285453/  We're struggling to fund our national health service, but yet our tax money can be spent towards this uneducated and ill-informed anti encryption and privacy campaign.  What an embarrassment for the UK.
2022-01-17T21:32:58Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what happened to private messaging James? Did it get removed?
2022-01-20T08:16:54Z	(#igt4mga) Gitea is lovely. Its amazing how fast it is.  What feature in this release are you liking the most?
2022-01-20T08:22:11Z	(#s4nrvja) I wish the web was like this. I would 100% take this over the spying, tracking, huge file sizes, adverts, popups, chat windows, cookie banners, forced signups, centralised hosting, social sharing.
2022-01-20T17:29:42Z	(#nhelsza) It always amazes me just how bad Microsoft's "products" are. I actually thought Windows 95 to XP where really good, lightweight (relatively speaking) and flexible.  I got a Windows PC for gaming a while back, which is Windows 10 I think. The entire thing is just a cesspit of surveillance and adverts. But, with the added benefit, of having to pay for a closed source proprietary piece of garbage.  Why anyone would choose to use that over Linux or a Mac is beyond me. Don't get me wrong, macOS is still trash. But miles better than that Windows disaster.
2022-01-20T18:05:59Z	(#bweqbwa) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> yeah, I'm really fussy over software and a big supporter of the GPL/GNU/FSF stuff. So pretty much any proprietary software, I'm against 😛 I'm very unreasonable, I know 😛  But I really hate: - telemetry - signing/gatekeeping software - can't actually download it in a nice iso - lots of legal conditions, like only allowed on Apple hardware. Can't just buy the os. - closed source - its huge. Like GBs in size  Currently I use popOS on a System76 laptop. It's pretty good, although I wish it wasn't based on Ubuntu.
2022-01-20T19:14:14Z	(#bweqbwa) Yeah, absoluteky. The closed source  reason doesn't make it trash. Sublime text is in no way trash, but is closed source and proprietary.  It's the points I listed after, that gets me to the conclusion macOS is trash.  Signing is a great feature. But the gatekeeper shouldn't be Apple.  8gb is huge. But I guess, like everything, it's subjective.
2022-01-20T19:17:41Z	(#bweqbwa) Yeah I'm using Windows for a bit of gaming. But most stuff on Steam actually works on Linux, via Wine. I think/hope you're right, we'll finally have a year of the Linux desktop 😁

2022-01-22T06:20:11Z	I'm confused. There is a hacker-news feed here, and I can see an interesting post I wanted to comment on:   Twtxt search says it's there, but I can't actually see the post. I do follow hacker-news on twtxt, but there's only like 5 posts from there.    Is this expected or a bug?  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/jK3GY9ruRaXeHqWWHexdF6.png)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/77paR9v8xFKGLAp2xVfZvG.png)

2022-08-02T19:38:40Z	(#qrpxafq) Yeah I get your dilemma James. I have almost the same one. I hate how Intel and AMD chips have built in backdoors [1] that Intel/AMD can take control of your machine without you knowing/agreeing. But it's impossible to find a laptop/machine that doesn't use Intel. There are a few ARM chromebooks, but they're really not good enough for a daily driver.  Apple managed to escape by using their own ARM mobile chips in the M1/M2 laptops. But the problem is Apple still create's a walled garden they can take over without your knowledge at any time. So we're back to square one.  I've had to suck it up, stick with this stupid Intel processor, but I'm on a system76 [2] (an amazing linux laptop to be fair) which uses coreboot , which at least frees me from the UEFI [3] firmware mess (which is Microsoft's control over what OS you can boot).  1. https://libreboot.org/faq.html#intelme 2. https://system76.com/laptops/oryx 3. http://techrights.org/2012/07/17/rms-on-uefi/  Oh wow, maximum message length? Annoying.
2022-08-02T19:40:50Z	(#qrpxafq) Okay to bring this back on topic. The reason I said all the above, is because I see the cloud hosting crap as a similar problem.  I think really we're stuck with them and their vendor locked, restricted, marketplace centric platforms. But we can minimize the lockin we use.  Make sure you only use VM's. Don't use any of their cloud databases, build, pipelines, kubernetes, containers, etc. Just use, simple, basic, abundant virtual machines that can be portable to other cloud companies.

2022-11-05T19:50:16Z	Are there many JavaScript developers on here? I've built a super basic testing library, because pretty much every library out there does a bunch of magic like auto running the suite, auto loading files, hooks (beforeEach/beforeAll/etc) and all the nesting (describe/it).  I don't think it's needed and have pretty much exclusively been doing "no mocking", "no hooks", and it's worked well for me.  https://github.com/markwylde/just-tap
2022-11-07T21:37:45Z	I'm looking into building a standalone app that can connect to any twtxt pod.  I'm considering a slack like approach, where down the left hand side you can have multiple pod instances.  Do people have an account on multiple pods? Or is there not really any point since you can feed into any pod from any other pod?
2022-11-07T21:41:31Z	(#wsj4ayq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm defo looking into building a multi pod PWA, especially now there shouldn't be any CORS issues between pods. But I'm struggling to get enough time to build it.
2022-11-07T21:44:54Z	(#glf7isq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, this is what I'm thinking. How about, since the app would technically be able to connect to any pod, it could store a list of pods you're a member of. For redundancy, for example.  So you would add an account (minimum of one), then you could also add additional. Then if you can't connect to the first pod, you can connect to the second?  Still pointless? I mean. It's easier to just have 1 account that's stored and connected to every time. But I'm just wondering if anyone here does have multiple accounts.
2022-11-07T21:52:08Z	(#glf7isq) I think maybe an account swither in the nav would be a good balance to start with. If it turns out many people use multiple pods, we could improve the UI to make switching easier.
2022-11-11T11:37:58Z	(#ag3ln3a) I love it. Just signed in and wondered if anyone had mentioned me. Clicked and saw this thread. ❤️
2022-11-11T11:41:55Z	I love simple, lightweight, small, minimal tools that just do the bare minimum. Based on that, does anyone have any good recommendations for a key value store that is: - lightweight - clustered - sharded (so if I have 5 instances and 100 keys, each node will roughly have 20 keys on it). - easy to join nodes: as in `kv-server --join somehost:1111`  For reference, I think Consul is too heavy (and not sharded I believe).  It would be great to have a small go executable, that I can run on 10 servers, all connected up, that exposes a redis like api. Simple GET, PUT and STREAM would be great.  @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> anyone else here I can ping?
2022-11-11T21:20:17Z	(#nlcsjfa) Thanks guys. Bitraft is awesome @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> but yeah, not sharded :( I did try etcd before @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> but I did find it tricker to setup than Bitraft. But again, it's not sharded :(
2022-11-11T21:22:52Z	(#nlcsjfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ever done any stress testing on bitraft? In a cluster, do you know that the throughput would be? Like, PUT's per second and GET's per second?
2022-11-11T21:40:25Z	(#nlcsjfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm happy to do it. Might try now actually. It was just incase you knew. I'll post in the README if I get it working. I'm hoping redis-benchmark will work since it's got the same api as redis.  I wonder if sharding could be implemented by:  Presumptions:  - redis can broadcast to all nodes in the cluster - REPLICA_COUNT is 3  PUT workflow: - a PUT get's forwarded to REPLICA_COUNT random nodes in the cluster  GET workflow: - a broadcast is made to the cluster saying "I NEED A VALUE FOR KEY 'TEST'" - all nodes that contain that value reply to the server - the first response get's forwarded to the client - the other responses are discarded  I'm sure there would be some edges cases, like syncing.  - What if 1 of the random node's is full and therefore only REPLICA_COUNT-1 nodes received the document - This could me 2 nodes have the new value, but the 3rd has the old value  Maybe it could be solved by only committing once REPLICA_COUNT nodes successfully receive the message.
2022-11-11T21:48:41Z	(#nlcsjfa) But in Bitraft every node contains every key + value, right? I probably wasn't clear above, but in my idea REPLICA_COUNT would be 3 but the NODE_COUNT may be 10. So a put would go to 3 of 10 of the nodes.
2022-11-11T22:03:40Z	(#nlcsjfa) Did a quick benchmark: https://git.mills.io/prologic/bitraft/issues/58  Seems the summary benchmark of a 5node cluster on my laptop is:  ``` GET: 1165.64 requests per second SET: 1061.80 requests per second ```
2022-11-11T22:19:34Z	How come there is only 25 pages of twts on the feed?  Does it cut off at 25 pages max, or 2 weeks old max?  What happens to older twts?   ![](https://twtxt.net/media/miDL8TYghEiMX3hKfXjg4g.png)
2022-11-11T22:30:37Z	(#eo6dbga) @<markwylde https://twtxt.net/user/markwylde/twtxt.txt> I would but 5.00am is _really_ early for a Saturday :(
2022-11-11T22:39:08Z	(#i4iupta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> for example, looking at your feed it says your first post was at 2022-03-09T23:38:24Z. But I know you were posting way before that. But if I look at mine, I see my first post was 2020-09-30T12:50:42Z.  So maybe it's cut off by file size?
2022-11-21T18:43:03Z	(#ym74jaa) The problem isn't with NodeJS or NPM, it's the developers that are so willing to use horrible frameworks/libraries/tooling that is just simply not needed. NodeJS gives you so much out of the box, and NPM is simply a place to store your packages. With Deno, you won't even need a package manager as it takes a step closer to go modules approach.  If you're going to use React, TypeScript, NextJs, Webpack, Styled Components, Material UI, Jest, and the 10k dependencies that comes with it, then yeah, your dev environment is going to be slow, bloated, and incredibly frustrating to work with. Not to mention have security issues. I've literally just done a fresh `create-react-app` installation (latest version 5.0.1 as I write this), and boom, 6 high severity vulnerabilities.  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/X6wMD86e6kwoFeSHS7TtNN.png)   But it doesn't have to be this way. Choose lightweight libraries that do one thing really well, and build your project from the ground up yourself.

2023-09-01T19:57:26Z	(#kudffeq) Interesting, it looks a little better for me, but it's a bit slow and laggy.  I've tried to stay away from hosting email servers myself. It's really hard. But I've thought about a project which uses something like mailgun or SES, but then I create a ui and restful server over the top of it. But, priorities....  ![screenshot of sogo](https://twtxt.net/media/HFkkx7sbo5VBUy7GfS4xy7.png)
2023-09-01T20:05:53Z	(#if5eb2a) I've really hated the entire idea of app stores. I have been on Google Pixels since the 4, and use Calyxos, so can't use PlayStore. Aurora comes preinstalled, but it's kinda flakey.  F-Droid is ideal, all reproducible builds, opensource. It's totally doable, but thinks like banking apps and utility apps, aren't on there, as probably never will be as they all do dodgy stuff they don't want you knowing about.  The reason I hate app stores, is because we already have a (somewhat decentralised) trusted transport in TLS/HTTPS. Like, I know if I'm on the hsbc.co.uk website, I'm 99.999999% sure I'm actually speaking to hsbc. So, then provide me the APK and let me down it. Or, make a decent PWA/WebApp so I don't need your app.  Thing is. I don't trust Google or Apple even a fraction as much as I would trust the TLS of the companies domain.
2023-09-01T20:07:55Z	(#kudffeq) @ada interesting. Is blacklisting/spam much of an issue? As in, will I have to constantly change fight to get my IP to be trusted with the big email providers?
