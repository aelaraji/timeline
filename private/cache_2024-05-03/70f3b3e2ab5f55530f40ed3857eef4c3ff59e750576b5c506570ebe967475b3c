2023-04-24T10:55:42Z	@<prologic https://gts.mills.io/users/prologic> (#m2elthq) Hello! 👋
2023-05-21T21:35:39Z	(#ux3bs2q) I started with Evernote, but for quick notes I went through TiddlyWiki and ended with a self-written link blog, which uses bookmarklet for input and stores everything in a RSS file. This way I am able to access my notes with a RSS reader app.  For a "pile of knowledge", I love to use TiddlyWiki though.  In any case, everyone has a different workflow with different requirements.
