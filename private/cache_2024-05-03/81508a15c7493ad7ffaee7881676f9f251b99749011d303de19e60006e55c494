2023-11-13T20:02:00+01:00	Testing posting for my new http://darch.dk/timeline/
2023-11-13T21:32:35+01:00	(#urautqa) Gracias. Also the [git repo](https://github.com/sorenpeter/timeline)  now contain code that should actually work
2023-11-14T10:26:57+01:00	(#ressqqa) I think is part of the code by @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> that I have based my project on. So try to ask him.
2023-11-15T22:30:14+01:00	@<johanbove https://johanbove.info/twtxt.txt> (#ieox7kq) Sounds interesting. It is only for reading or also posting?
2023-12-27T00:52:32+01:00	(#fh4u7va) danke sch√∏n, yes the idea was that it should work for all feeds
2024-02-01T07:09:05+01:00	(#fytbg6a) What about using the blockquote format with `>` ?‚Ä®‚Ä®> Snippet from someone else's post‚Ä®> by: @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt>‚Ä®‚Ä®Would it not also make sense to have the repost be a reply to the original post using the `(#twthash)`, and maybe using a tag like #repost so it eaier to filter them out?
2024-02-02T10:33:16+01:00	(#tjevvyq) I'm also more in favor of #reposts being human readable and writable.  A client might implement a bottom that posts something simple like: `#repost Look at this cool stuff, because bla bla [alt](url)`‚Ä®‚Ä®This will then make it possible to also "repost" stuff from other platforms/protocols.‚Ä®‚Ä®The reader part of a client, can then render a preview of the link, which we talked about would be a nice (optional) feature to have in yarnd.
2024-02-02T20:31:28+01:00	(#bfkzeva) I like this one the most
2024-02-19T12:31:01+01:00	(#mnpnvda) It already works: https://webfinger.net/lookup/?resource=xuu%40txt.sour.is‚Ä®but it not very well described afak
2024-02-20T22:44:34+01:00	Cool news from: https://signal.org/blog/phone-number-privacy-usernames/
2024-02-28T10:45:01+01:00	(#k2gqfxq) yeah, where and how can we sign up?
2024-03-01T13:29:36+01:00	(#7uxy6nq) ‚Ä®‚Ä®@<shreyan https://twtxt.net/user/shreyan/twtxt.txt> What do you mean when you say federation protocol?‚Ä®‚Ä®- Either use webfinger for identity like mastodon etc. or use ATproto from Bluesky (or both?)‚Ä®‚Ä®- We can use webmentions or create our own twt-mentions for notifying someones feed (WIP code at: https://github.com/sorenpeter/timeline/tree/webmention/views)‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm not sure we need much else. I would not even bother with encryption since other platforms does that better, and for me twtxt/yarn/timeline is for making things public
2024-03-04T17:11:38+01:00	(#7uxy6nq) So where do we start wring down the specs/protocol for twtxt2/yarn?
2024-03-10T19:57:19+01:00	I've gathers my ideas about mentions for twtxt/yarn here: [Webmentions vs. custom mentions spec for twtxt/yarn - HedgeDoc](https://docs.mills.io/s/s-b2CG020#)‚Ä®You are welcome to edit and comment in the doc, so our ideas are not fragment into a bunch of treads
2024-03-11T16:03:31+01:00	Did another write up on #webfinger and DIDs for twtxt/yarn that you can read and edit/comment in: [User lookup for twtxt/yarn - Webfinger or Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) - HedgeDoc](https://docs.mills.io/rRpmdWHRT7Kg7nTYnXleSg?view)
2024-03-11T19:20:40+01:00	(#i4nt3ma) Just hacked together this small webfinger endpoint to be used as a companion with timeline: [.well-known/webfinger/index.php at main ¬∑ sorenpeter/timeline](https://github.com/sorenpeter/timeline/blob/main/__webfinger_companion__/.well-known/webfinger/index.php)
2024-03-13T15:13:00+01:00	(#i4nt3ma) Also made a webfinger lookup resolver that works with my own webfinger endpoint as well as yarnd servers:‚Ä®http://darch.dk/wf-lookup.php ![](http://darch.dk/twtxt/wf_lookup_01.png) ![](http://darch.dk/twtxt/wf_lookup_02.png)
2024-03-16T16:28:25+01:00	(#qfge7za) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> For syncing notes between computers and phones I've been very happy with [Simple Text - w Dropbox sync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=simple.text.dropbox&hl=en&gl=US) for some year, but transitioned to [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) around new year. Both sync via Dropbox and for Joplin there are also more free options. I guess you could even use something like [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
2024-03-16T20:09:34Z	@<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> Take a look at http://darch.dk/timeline/conv/i4nt3ma
2024-03-17T00:07:32Z	(#dzobbnq) Thanks @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, I also just manage to get my own version of webmentions working. Please have a read at [Webmentions vs. Custom Mentions Spec for Twtxt/Yarn - HedgeDoc](https://docs.mills.io/NEOwhHmqTfOejKWiaOw9rw#) and [User Lookup for Twtxt/Yarn - Webfinger or Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) - HedgeDoc](https://docs.mills.io/rRpmdWHRT7Kg7nTYnXleSg#) for how it sorta works
2024-03-17T18:50:17Z	(#e4q7sgq) It not that easy @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> since I implemented webmentions in a different way that how it have been done in yarnd to work with txt-files. You can find the code in [webmention\_endpoint.php](https://github.com/sorenpeter/timeline/blob/main/views/webmention_endpoint.php) and [new\_twt.php at main ¬∑ sorenpeter/timeline](https://github.com/sorenpeter/timeline/blob/main/views/new_twt.php)
2024-03-27T08:25:03Z	(#6bi3lga) Same, got one more day at the office, but most folks are already away and the city have shifted from locals to tourists üåû
2024-03-27T18:48:52Z	(#geladtq) What? was? that? Music videos in the 90s was just something else. Especially like the guy in the straitjacket on a pogostick
2024-03-28T19:12:59Z	(#pssl4pa) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I'm over here now. And yes I can send a PR to repo or your are welcome to add it. Credits also to @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> for making a working yarn compatible parser.
2024-03-28T19:16:14Z	(#bhslreq) you need to send an email @<quark https://ferengi.one/twtxt.txt> if you want an account. I know that it might not be very profitable. Maybe Odo can disclose it if I give him a new bucket.
2024-04-01T15:24:56Z	(#vw3qicq) Hi @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>, is it better now?‚Ä®I have put in a psudo twthash since I did not archive from a specific date/post, but just what I did not find relevant to keep in my main feed.

2024-04-07T22:18:42Z	(#ba3xbfa) Thanks for your feedback @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>. For some reason i missed it until now. For now I have implemented endpoint discovery for #webmentions as a metadata field in the twtxt.txt like this:‚Ä®`# webmention = http://darch.dk/timeline/webmention`
2024-04-08T12:16:05Z	(#ba3xbfa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> you can over at http://darch.dk/timeline/conv/ba3xbfa or by looking at the raw txt https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt ‚Ä®I can't help it that twtxt.net only have temporary caching ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
2024-04-08T13:28:40Z	(#hn4hnma) yes i know @<bender  https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt>, it's on my to-do

2024-04-10T07:41:06Z	(#twnno2a) @<hecanjog https://hecanjog.com/twtxt.txt> You need to include the full URL for the audio file for this to work across servers/pods ;)
2024-04-14T16:53:29Z	Just fleshed out the README for timeline at https://github.com/sorenpeter/timeline - Comments/corrections and PRs are welcome:)
2024-04-21T07:43:39Z	(#7ef2sea) The wording can be more subtle like "This feed have not seen much activity within the last year" and maybe adding a UI like I did in timeline showing time ago for all feeds ![](https://darch.dk/twtxt/following-time-ago.png)‚Ä®‚Ä®I agree that it good to clean up the Mastodon re-feeds, but it should also be okay for anyone to spin up a twtxt.txt just for syndicating they stuff from blog or what ever.‚Ä®‚Ä®The "not receiving replies" could partly be fixed by implementing a working webmentions for twtxt.txt
2024-04-26T19:46:38Z	I just "published" a #draft on my blog about "How I've implemented #webmentions for twtxt" (http://darch.dk/mentions-twtxt), so I wanted to know from you guys if you see yourself doing a similar thing with `yarnd` @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or others with custom setups?
2024-04-27T05:57:12Z	(#lhfziyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> for a start a [single user twtxt/yarn pod](https://github.com/sorenpeter/timeline) could look like this üòâ ![](https://darch.dk/timeline/media/timeline_conv.png) ![](https://darch.dk/timeline/media/timeline_gallery.jpg)
2024-04-27T06:06:59Z	(#nypdk5a) @<dfaria https://twtxt.net/user/dfaria/twtxt.txt> the difference is that these other servers does not post several times a day with content that are not informative/interesting to people outside your academic context, which can be perceived as noise.‚Ä®‚Ä®What @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> have done is what I would call curation of the service he offers to the world for free (as in beer). It's no one right to have their posts syndicated to the frontpage of twtxt.net, it's simply a gift he gives to the world and he is free (as in speak) to wrap is anyway he sees fit.‚Ä®‚Ä®@<dfaria.eu https://dfaria.eu/twtxt.txt> I hope you stay around üåû
2024-04-29T09:03:33Z	(#jleb2hq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  Haha, that sh!t is pure (net)art!
