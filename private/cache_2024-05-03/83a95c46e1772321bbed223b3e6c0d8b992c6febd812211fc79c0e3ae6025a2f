2017-11-03T20:29:16-04:00	Made something because my head was on sideways all day.
2021-01-03T16:40:12-05:00	Hello, world.
2021-01-03T22:14:55-05:00	Apparently I did something for this like three years ago, and can't find it. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
2021-01-04T02:34:37-05:00	Okay, well, if we're being all txtpunk, I want troff macros for zines.
2021-01-04T13:50:22-05:00	I have a working model for the reader portion of what I want this twtxt client to do.
2021-01-05T00:43:29-05:00	Okay, my #twtxt reader works-ish. Need to properly deal with timezones (and, um, maybe do *any* error checking).
2021-01-12T00:15:15-05:00	Well, my twtxt reader is a bit *too* simple; drops who actually wrote the message before it's printed. ü§¶üèª
2021-01-11T23:48:37-08:00	Okay, a bit better: it now preserves the author, although it prints a hash right now. Tomorrow's problem.
2021-01-12T23:39:21-08:00	Wrote a man page for this thing. I miss writing man pages.
2021-01-17T02:53:16-05:00	Thanks to a pointer from Richard Miller, got screen rotation working on my Pi 4s. Makes this absurdly wide display more practical.
2021-01-21T20:10:31-08:00	I have ~10 different kinds of USB cables/adaptors, and I can't make the conversion I need.üòû
2021-01-21T20:12:18-08:00	On the up side: I got my first successful comunication over i2c on Plan 9 on a Raspberry Pi today! Looking forward to playing with that more.
2021-01-21T20:13:01-08:00	Documentation on i2c devices is so-so. Lots of good documentation on higher-level APIs, but not a lot of "this register does this" stuff.
2021-01-23T03:19:58-05:00	My daughter grabbed my mouse and started smacking it arouond and managed to do things I didn't know you could do with my WM with a mouse... nor how to undo them.
2021-01-30T22:57:56-08:00	Started the #gsoc application for Plan 9 yesterday morning; spun up a new cpu server last night; poking at it today. I miss being able to spend more time on this.
2021-02-08T18:11:22-08:00	One of these days I will learn not to argue with the bitcoin bros.
2021-02-09T00:16:31-08:00	Today, out of the blue, somebody thanked me for some minor tech work I did in 2008. That felt pretty nice.
2021-02-09T18:08:31-08:00	Last night I spent about 30 minutes putting together the bare framework for a dumb project I want to do. I'm so excited to work on it, I keep checking the website to see if I've posted anything new.Ôøº
2021-02-09T23:52:37-08:00	Announcing the Plan 9 Foundation ‚Äî http://p9f.org/ ‚Äî https://9fans.topicbox.com/groups/9fans/T973ff41a99053355/plan-9-foundation
2021-02-12T22:57:41-08:00	I ran fortune for something to stick in a text-centric side project, and it said "You can't build a bomb at 300 baud." which is just about perfect.
2021-02-13T23:22:57-08:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<ihfvsia https://twtxt.net/search?tag=ihfvsia>) rc, the Plan 9 shell.
2021-02-13T23:24:18-08:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<l6klv2q https://twtxt.net/search?tag=l6klv2q>) I've just never had it be a rewarding experience.
2021-02-13T23:36:30-08:00	I don't think I'm implementing twtxt.net-style hashtags (for now?). The "<foo url>" is bad enough for nicks, but they just make the plain text unreadable.
2021-02-14T01:25:30-08:00	Hah... my silly twtxt client now has "stories" mode.‚ò∫
2021-02-14T12:57:20-08:00	(#<v5yaeha https://twtxt.net/search?tag=v5yaeha>) I don't have any issue with the (foo) subjects, it's the proliferation of the (foo url) tags. They're just too long and ugly.
2021-02-14T12:57:33-08:00	(#<v5yaeha https://twtxt.net/search?tag=v5yaeha>) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> No argument that threading is an improvement. But I think (#hash) does that, and I think figuring out how to search should mostly be up to the client.
2021-02-14T12:57:47-08:00	(#<v5yaeha https://twtxt.net/search?tag=v5yaeha>) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yes, I often read the raw messages. But more to the point, the simplicity of the format is the bulk of the appeal.
2021-02-14T15:10:56-08:00	(#<v5yaeha https://twtxt.net/search?tag=v5yaeha>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>Yes, I think tags should just be #foo, and let the client figure out searching if it cares.
2021-02-14T15:11:28-08:00	(#v5yaeha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>For example, this should work (no idea if it does).
2021-02-14T15:12:38-08:00	My silly Plan 9 rc twtxt client now has a web page: http://txtpunk.com/tw/index.html
2021-02-14T17:57:04-08:00	(#v5yaeha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Looks like twtxt.net is already happy with it, so that's good! I'm just going to aim for that.
2021-02-14T20:52:16-08:00	I'm unclear if I'm going to do the twtxt.net discovery protocol; neither my web server nor Plan 9's default capture agent strings. :-/
2021-02-14T23:53:29-08:00	(#yh3bdga) @<https://twtxt.net/user/bml/twtxt.txt> It was totally an April Fools' joke; the IETF has a bunch of those. But! It has also been implemented. And 418 is my favorite error code.
2021-02-15T00:00:12-08:00	(#xo4qava) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> You may be interested in https://github.com/u-root/u-root (I work with a contributor).
2021-02-15T11:15:00-08:00	(#yh3bdga) @<bml https://twtxt.net/user/bml/twtxt.txt> Yup, several. My favorite is RFC 1149, another that's since been implemented. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day_Request_for_Comments
2021-02-15T14:09:11-08:00	(#v5yaeha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Exactly, but that reduces the argument for URLs in the post. The client should figure out how to search based on the hashtag.
2021-02-15T14:11:30-08:00	(#v5yaeha) I agree clients should present things better (part of why I'm writing one!). But that should be additive. There's a reason we're not passing json around.
2021-02-15T15:06:50-08:00	@<xjix https://xj-ix.luxe/.well-known/webring/tw.txt> Saw your oldish note about wanting an offline/async twtxt workflow. Do you have something that works for you? My (very young!) client was designed with that in mind.
2021-02-15T23:31:53-08:00	Pushed small updates to tw. Next: make discoverability optional.
2021-02-15T23:35:27-08:00	I want read-only iOS client that just does the simplest model: pull a list of feeds, make a timeline.
2021-02-19T01:12:04-08:00	Plan 9's GSoC application is now in. üéâ
2021-02-19T01:16:13-08:00	Ooo, tw has a race condition between tw/r and pull/mktl, in the case you /r after a new post but before pull & mktl have run. Oops.
2021-02-19T19:12:38-08:00	The GSoC application period is closed, and Plan 9's is in. Now the waiting.
2021-02-19T23:04:08-08:00	Fixed the race in tw. Mostly; now it's just while tw/r is running. Close enough.
2021-02-24T20:30:42-08:00	I have been using Unix for 25+ years and I just learned about the status character in shells (often ^T). Huh.
2021-02-25T11:04:34-08:00	(#mxlhmsq) I was reading dd(1), where it is mentioned in passing, obliquely. Then stty(1) has more info.
2021-02-26T19:38:51-08:00	(#mxlhmsq) This was macOS. I don't really use gnu. Of course, it's also not on Plan 9, the system I know best.
2021-02-26T21:09:30-08:00	I just made the decision to allow a domain I own to expire. Personal growth is possible!
2021-02-26T21:43:19-08:00	My finger server now includes the last post from tw that doesn't have a subject. 'finger a@9srv.net'
2021-02-26T22:03:28-08:00	(#ptxp5ca) With the finger server specifically? No idea, it's a toy. I'd honestly forgotten I had it on until someone mentioned finger.farm and I was inspired to poke at it again.
2021-02-26T22:04:54-08:00	(#ptxp5ca) I like finger, but outside of a shared system, the complete lack of discoverability is pretty fatal.
2021-02-26T22:09:44-08:00	(#ptxp5ca) No, totally not useful. ü§£ I mean, the finger protocol is pretty trivial, and it'd be fun to add, but doesn't replace anything you're doing.
2021-02-26T22:35:25-08:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Bug in your profile links: it's repeating a segment. For example, your face tries to get to https://twtxt.net/user/https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt
2021-02-26T23:01:29-08:00	(#ptxp5ca) I don't think the pod would have to be large. Even on tilde.club and the like, with a few dozen active users, it adds to the fun.
2021-02-27T07:05:24-08:00	(#ptxp5ca) Ah, no; and there we have a good example of finger's poor discoverability! It matches my email address, though: echo a.9srv.net | sed 's/\./@/'
2021-02-27T09:47:29-08:00	(#ptxp5ca) Huh. In my feed, there is (correctly) a backslash before that . in the sed command, but twtxt.net is stripping it.
2021-02-27T13:42:11-08:00	(#s5ncraa) Yup, 1997 to... 2000 or 2001.
2021-02-27T21:17:51-08:00	I am very excited about this, and it seems like something the twtxt crowd might enjoy: https://anewsession.com/
2021-03-05T08:39:03-08:00	This is a good morning. üöÄüêá
2021-03-05T09:06:28-08:00	(#prm7aaa) Plan 9 doesn't really do text-mode pseudo-graphics at all, or even cursor addressing, on philosophical grounds.
2021-03-05T09:40:53-08:00	(#fx4xdiq) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Some linux; how does one tell which?
2021-03-05T09:53:06-08:00	(#fx4xdiq) uname; I have an account. I just don't know how to differentiate linux especially.
2021-03-05T16:26:02-08:00	(#fx4xdiq) Thanks! According to /etc/os-releases, it's Fedora 32.
2021-03-05T18:02:58-08:00	(#fx4xdiq) Hey, from my perspective on Plan 9, all these linuxes are the same junk.
2021-03-05T20:15:49-08:00	(#fx4xdiq) Hrm, that would've been csh probably, or tcsh if you were lucky. But Plan 9 uses rc, which is so lovely I use it everywhere.
2021-03-05T21:05:09-08:00	(#fx4xdiq) Oh no, so much better than that. Worth checking out.
2021-03-05T21:43:18-08:00	(#fx4xdiq) I've got it running on a pair of commercial kvm providers right now (vultr and ramnode). It works on many, but edge cases can cause some issues.
2021-03-06T07:25:09-08:00	(#fx4xdiq) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I am not. :-)
2021-03-09T16:17:44-08:00	Plan 9 is GSoC! üéâüêá I've missed participating this program. https://9fans.topicbox.com/groups/9fans/Ta35cde1382617430-M32af07f289087f227189b74f/plan-9-in-summer-of-code
2021-03-10T08:37:47-08:00	At some point, for reasons I do not understand, my feed reader replaced cabinporn dot com with freecabinporn dot com, which is *not* the same thing.
2021-03-10T08:45:45-08:00	(#hd4zrla) We welcome prospective students to submit their own ideas, but we've got a page full of suggestions: http://p9f.org/wiki/gsoc-2021-ideas/index.html
2021-03-14T20:02:57-07:00	Someone brought us pie for Pi Day. üíØ
2021-03-22T08:19:25-07:00	I am very excited for tomorrow.
2021-03-23T16:10:09-07:00	Bell Labs has now transferred Plan 9 to the Plan 9 Foundation, who has in turn re-released all releases under the MIT license. I am *very* excited about this. üêáüéâ
2021-03-23T23:04:29-07:00	(#3jypihq) Not even a little. So pumped. https://9fans.topicbox.com/groups/9fans/Tf20bce89ef96d4b6-M63f81768e4ffdfa4df402ec5/transfer-of-plan-9-to-the-plan-9-foundation
2021-03-24T00:09:21-07:00	(#gcw2syq) This is an awful take. The issue isn't that he's cantankerous and rigid; it's that he's sexist, misogynistic, ableist, transphobic, and has a decades-long history of making women feel unsafe. This isn't "cancel culture", it's "consequences" (as is usually the case with that term).
2021-03-24T01:01:25-07:00	(#6ecbdxq) I actually haven't yet, it's just easy enough to manually prepend the subject for now, if I skip the search URL. ü§£ I'll do it properly eventually.
2021-03-24T01:03:33-07:00	(#gcw2syq) He's fine with gender-neutral pronouns when he gets to pick them, but insists on policing others'. The open letter calling for his removal has references.
2021-03-24T23:54:42-07:00	(#6ecbdxq) Sure. I think search, if it's going to exist, should be the client's responsibility. But I also value the readability of the raw twtxt file a lot more than y'all do.
2021-03-26T21:36:24-07:00	(#fwlweuq) What a terrible video. "Cancel culture" is not a thing, and when you hear someone complaining about it, 99% of the time they just don't want consequences for bad behavior.
2021-03-27T08:45:21-07:00	(#fwlweuq) I can't believe it's controversial to say "somebody with a 30+ year history making women uncomfortable shouldn't be in a leadership position". That's not "cancel culture", it's just friggin' obvious.
2021-03-27T08:47:47-07:00	(#fwlweuq) Nobody's saying he can't write code any more (I mean, I think his code is crap and wish he'd stop, but that's another issue). But he should not be on any board, should not be in any leadership position, should not be held up as a role model or even vaguely okay.
2021-04-05T16:51:47-07:00	Just over a week left to apply to Summer of Code. Plan 9 is in there, and ~200 other good orgs. Go apply and tell students you know. https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/
2021-04-06T10:12:24-07:00	Anyone (preferably in the PDX area) have a way to read QIC-80 tapes?
2021-04-06T17:54:59-07:00	(#2lpzvhq) Think of it like buying a signed print of a photo, instead of the photo itself, but the "signature" is an entry in a database and that's all you get. Still dumb.
2021-04-07T21:26:23-07:00	Dynamic linking was a mistake.
2021-04-14T20:59:45-07:00	(#xyiy3da) Good idea. Plan 9 sets $NPROC on boot to the number of cores, so other things can use it. mk will dispatch things in just that way.
2021-04-27T23:13:58-07:00	Pinboard describes itself as "Social bookmarking for introverts". Maybe txtxt is social networking for introverts.
2021-04-27T23:18:27-07:00	(#klffeva) Or maybe that's old-school twtxt, and twtxt.net is those people who're constantly trying to coax the introverts out. ;-)
2021-04-27T23:18:59-07:00	(#klffeva) Then finger is for the straight-up shut-ins.
2021-04-29T13:35:29-07:00	I've published my silly finger implementation: http://txtpunk.com/finger
2021-05-10T14:14:32-07:00	I just timed it: 59 seconds for my Raspberry Pi to boot, 33 of which is waiting for my keyboard firmware to initialize. That's just absurd.
2021-05-10T23:28:04-07:00	(#qao7fha) ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø It's a funky mechanical thing running QMK, but I have two others that fit that description which don't behave like this.
2021-05-11T06:36:09-07:00	(#qao7fha) For sure. The pi progresses normally until it prints that it's initializing the keyboard, at which point the keyboard spends ~30 seconds beeping.
2021-05-11T06:39:18-07:00	(#qao7fha) Unrelated: my first response shows a rendering bug on your site: it's dropping a backslash. Hard to mix markdown and genuine plain text.

2021-05-17T15:29:03-07:00	Plan 9 got three slots in GSoC; we'll be working on an updated Japanese input method, updating edwood, and getting Oauth2 support. üéâüêá
2021-05-28T13:02:14-07:00	Fixed a bug. Found a new bug in yesterday's work. Fixed that bug.
2021-06-06T08:06:27-07:00	Looking at raw IRC traffic streams to debug a client issue and it's 1997 again.
2021-06-06T15:37:55-07:00	(#jwzkdea) Indeed! I think the first "network protocol client" I ever wrote was something that just did the PING/PONG part and passed everything else raw.
2021-06-08T21:43:54-07:00	Fixed another bug in my finger client: rfc1288 says lines have to end with crlf, but I was just sending lf.
2021-06-12T09:06:10-07:00	(#nj3rtxa) Why can't you have : in file names? What file system is this?
2021-06-12T17:07:35-07:00	(#nj3rtxa) macOS doesn't care, at least on apfs; just tested. How are you hitting this?
2021-06-13T17:46:35-07:00	(#nj3rtxa) Entirely sensible, & no reason for file storage to match the wire format. I'm just really curious what's going on on macOS! I can test on hfs+ later.Ôøº
2021-06-15T15:01:23-07:00	[20:22:00] -tower.freenode.net- Server Terminating. Received SIGTERM
2021-06-15T20:56:53-07:00	(#ciwsjga) You've basically already left, whether you know it or not. Yesterday they nuked their services database. I'd been there ~20 years, but it's dead. Libera.chat has been lovely.
2021-06-16T16:20:53-07:00	(#ciwsjga) Yes, this all matches my experience as someone connected to "classic" Freenode, right up until they killed the server (after the last step that page describes).Ôøº
2021-06-17T13:29:10-07:00	(#whcybdq) i'm not really advocating that anybody should be on *more* networks, but FWIW libera.chat has been very nice, the staff has been doing a great job, and it's the nearest "spiritual successor" to what we all liked about Freenode.Ôøº
2021-06-18T07:43:19-07:00	My toddler just figured out "hey Siri".
2021-06-18T22:32:33-07:00	First pass at sticking my twtxt in a web page. It's not escaping all the html properly, and generally needs work, but it's a start: http://a.9srv.net/tw/following.html
2021-06-20T01:14:24-07:00	(#eymhvia) Honestly, probably not directly, but that's mostly because of my weird environment. I'd love to see it as a reference!
2021-06-21T22:08:52-07:00	Today I swapped out our water heater for a new hybrid one. It took twice as long as it should have and 3 extra trips to the hardware store, but it doesn't seem to be leaking and is producing hot water, so üéâüéäüéá
2021-06-27T14:39:49-07:00	(#dzmkf4a) Yeah, what'd you have in mind?
2021-06-29T22:18:04-07:00	As of about an hour ago, I'm the chair of the Columbia County Democrats. üò≥üéâüò±
2021-06-29T23:07:27-07:00	(#dzmkf4a) Potentially. What environment/language(s) are you working in? I'd dump fuse for 9p, personally :-)
2021-07-03T14:44:18-07:00	I wrote a 'banner'-like program for Plan 9 (and p9p) that uses the Unicode box drawing characters: http://txtpunk.com/banner/index.html
2021-07-05T02:06:56-07:00	(#bwtffpa) Cleaned up a bit, with installation instructions for Plan 9 and p9p, tiny character tweaks, and a change log.
2021-07-05T02:09:39-07:00	(#bwtffpa) I feel like this could be borderline useful if I stuck a web UI on it. ü§î
2021-07-05T07:52:42-07:00	(#bwtffpa) No, I'm still doing them manually. ü§£ü§¶üèª But I do think they are a good idea and will be adding them, I just haven't gotten around to finding a compatible implementation of the hash yet.ÔøºÔøº
2021-07-06T22:45:22-07:00	My kid just uncovered a bug in a program I wrote by grabbing my laptop and smacking the keyboard a bunch. Biological input fuzzing; a real-life chaos monkey.
2021-07-07T07:28:37-07:00	(#2gpk2ma) It did! And I fixed the bug last night. And now I'm curious how your pod deals with spam. üëÜüèº
2021-07-07T07:32:01-07:00	(#gjjwa6q) Move your code. Copilot is just one more reason. I maintain an account to work with other projects, but won't host my stuff there.
2021-07-07T22:29:13-07:00	(#2gpk2ma) And yes, I was able to reproduce the "test" input. It wasn't a complicated test, she just beat me to it.
2021-07-08T23:15:55-07:00	(#2gpk2ma) "√ß", I think. Anything above 7-bit ASCII would've done it, though.
2021-07-09T13:13:42-07:00	(#2gpk2ma) Well I'm happy to accept patches to linebanner if you'd like to add characters. :-) http://txtpunk.com/banner/index.html
2021-07-30T21:57:33-07:00	Get vaccinated if you are able. At this point, if you are able and choosing not to, you are being incredibly selfish, full stop.
2021-07-31T07:12:22-07:00	(#3qbo22q) Whole lot of false statements here. The vaccines are well-tested & well-studied, and are safe and effective. Breakthrough cases exist with every vaccine. If you are able and the vaccine is approved for you, choosing not to get it puts everyone around you at risk, including risk of additional variants developing.
2021-08-22T17:24:07-07:00	Yesterday's surprising find: a little Gochu Jang (~tsp) does a nice job of improving uninspiring Italian tomato sauce. Nothing dramatic, but good.
2021-08-31T09:26:53-07:00	‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt have time at the moment to defend positions you‚Äôve made up for me. Have a nice day.‚Äù
2021-09-09T21:27:54-07:00	I was on a call this evening discussing various redistricting proposals. Some dude seriously asserted that over-representation by Multnomah county in regional politics might lead to... *genocide*. üò≥
2021-09-10T06:32:04-07:00	(#zizoxoa) His argument hung on Soviet-era experiments with centrally-planned farming. üôÑ The man did not seem well.
2021-09-18T14:39:00-07:00	Based on spam logs, I am (again) considering banning a bunch of TLDs at the server level. Has anyone ever gotten legitimate email from a .work, .casa, or .today domain, for example?
2021-09-22T10:16:13-07:00	(#k2d5k6a) I think I was some many years ago? They are neat and so some good stuff.
2021-09-22T10:20:21-07:00	@<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> I like your website's look, but i was disappointed to find that 'finger' doesn't seem to actually work. ;-)
2021-09-22T17:34:57-07:00	(#m6fesrq) You need better pen test scripts. :-) Seriously, the protocol is absurdly simple. Turn it on! Don't trust any of the implementations? Write your own!
2021-09-22T17:43:56-07:00	(#m6fesrq) It seems like something *especially* all the tilde-inspired things should have on.
2021-09-23T00:16:15-07:00	(#m6fesrq) Yup, and my answer's the same: very little. But it's fun! Have fun with computers!
2021-09-23T00:28:17-07:00	(#m6fesrq) To be clear, it isn't that it doesn't provide a valuable service; it's just that there are more convenient ways of doing it. But screw convenience!
2021-10-16T09:12:46-07:00	This week I turned 16,000 days old.
2021-10-26T12:40:41-07:00	Dug out my old usb audio device and now my Plan 9 raspberry pi can play music. üíØ
2021-10-26T21:17:29-07:00	(#j4xqvna) Lots. ü§£ The system is small, coherent, and understandable in a way no modern unix is. The namespace operations remain incredibly powerful. And several of the tools built on it, like the way network listeners and the mail server are built, are just much nicer to use, modify, and build on.
2021-10-26T21:20:23-07:00	(#j4xqvna) Lots of downsides, too, but overall I still find it the most comfortable environment for anything that doesn't need a web browser. :-)
2021-10-26T21:57:06-07:00	(#j4xqvna) Oh, me too: FreeBSD, macOS, and Solaris in server environments extensively, and Linux, AIX, HP/UX, Irix, probably others I'm forgetting. Plan 9 is a whole other class of thing.
2021-11-01T21:47:17-07:00	I want NaNoWriMo but for tech writing.

2021-11-17T14:41:49-08:00	Use C do crime! https://cdn.masto.host/pdxsocial/media_attachments/files/107/294/565/215/390/680/original/1d29c85c0aa4c9a5.png
2021-11-17T20:09:19-08:00	(#wqrpbyq) Hah. It's an edit of a "be gay do crimes" meme, in response to this: https://twitter.com/Cor3ntin/status/1460614695564496901
2021-11-18T09:11:19-08:00	(#wqrpbyq) Uh, I think you are taking every line of that *way* too seriously.
2021-11-29T14:24:29-08:00	A 556 IC is functionally the same as two 555 ICs, but I've decided the 555 is better because search engines don't confuse it for ammunition as much.
2021-12-07T20:09:21-08:00	I fork bombed my computer! With ed(1)!!! Haven't done that in a while.
2021-12-08T00:02:02-08:00	(#wkul3na) I made a gpio button on my raspberry pi which opens a new window running ed. I screwed up while testing it and launched maaaaany ed windows.
2021-12-08T11:50:22-08:00	(#wkul3na) @lyse ed(1) is the standard editor. ;-)
2021-12-08T11:51:31-08:00	(#wkul3na) @lyse This was basically a trial/proof-of-concept for the real goal: a switch which, if on at boot time, causes the pi to boot straight to ed.
2021-12-08T13:05:08-08:00	(#wkul3na) I am not launching it with a specific file right now, but I'll likely have it default to my daily work log shortly.
2021-12-08T17:12:28-08:00	(#wkul3na) This pi will now boot directly to ed if the gpio pin is grounded at boot time. ed(1)term v1. :-) http://txtpunk.com/edterm/
2021-12-09T11:02:35-08:00	Killing time in Goodwill, I picked up a desk calculator from a pile. Dude standing next to me goes "what's that for?". üò≥üíÄ
2021-12-13T08:20:55-08:00	Spent the weekend with the state Democrats at our platform convention. Good work and glad to have participated, but 20 hours of zoom over 60 hours is a lot of zoom.
2021-12-13T15:02:43-08:00	(#fx74tha) It's the (roughly) bi-annual platform convention. I think the new platform does a good job of holding to progressive values (even if I wish it went farther in places). I got an amendment in to improve our stance on encryption-related issues, which was nice.
2021-12-13T15:03:53-08:00	(#fx74tha) There's still an editing/proofreading pass to do before it becomes official, but the content is done.
2021-12-13T15:18:12-08:00	(#fx74tha) Agreed on "aggressive" ‚Äî as a general rule, I don't think most folks are acting like we're in the kind of crisis we are.
2021-12-16T11:57:07-08:00	As a postmaster, Gmail remains the most irritating domain to send to. Soooo many false spam hits, such little information provided, so many hoops to jump through.
2021-12-30T13:28:24-08:00	I just went to type the phrase "I avoid Linux like the plague" but then remembered that we've all learned that most people won't actually go much out of their way to avoid the plague.
2021-12-30T13:29:47-08:00	Web3 being "democratic" makes perfect sense if you can't tell the difference between a dollar and a person.
2022-01-01T22:08:07-08:00	Nominally, my seen/read list for 2021, but I missed a *lot* of short readings. I may try to write more about these things this year. http://a.9srv.net/media/2021
2022-01-08T21:57:30-08:00	Seeing "http://ftp" in a URL makes me happy.
2022-01-08T22:33:49-08:00	(#ppt5eja) I'm not sure! It feels similar to seeing "~username" in a URL. Part nostalgia, part... impressed at the persistence?
2022-01-09T16:21:07-08:00	(#ppt5eja) Check the raw file. ;-) Yes, "http colon slash slash ftp".
2022-01-09T22:03:47-08:00	(#ppt5eja) I think y'all are missing something. I never used ftp as a schema; I'm saying the "ftp" hostname part with the "http" schema is amusing.
2022-01-12T15:21:22-08:00	Anyone seen a pixel-addressed display (any tech; lcd, eink, oled, whatever) in the range of 8"x1"?
2022-01-16T22:53:08-08:00	About two years late, but I finally finished setting up an iOS Shortcut so I can post to my blog via ssh. http://a.9srv.net/b/
2022-01-16T22:58:28-08:00	Only 1 day of activity so far, but I've started a new project log for whatever the heck I end up doing to this Monroe 425 I got. http://a.9srv.net/monroe425
2022-01-17T08:35:38-08:00	(#trfdoxq) iOS has had a "Shortcuts" app for a while now which is very useful for scripting things on the device, and at some point grew the ability to run things via ssh, including piping input/output. It's how I've done twtxt from my phone for a while now. I'll clean up these two examples and post to the examples I've shared. http://a.9srv.net/shortcuts
2022-01-17T14:07:39-08:00	(#trfdoxq) Okay, I've updated my examples page and shared the more complex ssh example. http://a.9srv.net/shortcuts
2022-01-18T02:03:42-08:00	I have only just discovered this and need to dig in more, but so far it looks like a really nice reference for electronics pinouts: https://pinouts.org/
2022-01-24T14:14:38-08:00	Good weekend for random tech projects: this rackmount server I got free boots Plan 9 without issue, and my ttl adapters and wii nunchucks just arrived. Now where can I find a serial modem?
2022-02-11T19:32:23-08:00	Given that we don't have a "home phone", what's the best way to create a "hunt group" for my partner's and my cell phones? My first thought is Asterisk on a VPS, but my knowledge of such things is years out of date. Is there a better way?
2022-02-11T20:05:03-08:00	(#dp3ixba) Thanks, I'd forgotten about that. I'd rather avoid Google Voice, and I'm okay paying (reasonably). Looking like Twilio might have most of what I want natively.
2022-02-11T21:28:31-08:00	(#dp3ixba) A "hunt group" is a phone number you can call which will ring some set of other phones and whoever answers first gets the call, and the others stop ringing.
2022-03-19T18:22:53-07:00	(#5chf2va) Lots of personal preference, but I disagree on Acme: it's far and away my preferred editor on unix-like systems, too.
2022-03-19T18:32:11-07:00	@<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Also, I noticed you followed me on Twitter, but you might enjoy @anths if you want techie stuff instead of Oregon politics. ü§£
2022-05-10T15:51:11-07:00	I realized my twtxt client isn't validating what it pulls once it gets a valid response when a domain started returning js-heavy parking pages for every URL. Oops. Weekend project, I guess. ü§¶üèª
2022-05-18T21:29:32-07:00	I want a browser for iOS that's basically Mobile Safari but without JavaScript (or at least an easy toggle). Does such a thing exist?
2022-05-24T15:27:02-07:00	(#tjtdc2q) That's the effect I'm after, but I want it not on my main browser. Turns out the Brave mobile app does this.
2022-05-30T23:30:00-07:00	A read-only, finger(1)-based social network, maybe? http://txtpunk.com/fingers/
2022-05-31T07:07:11-07:00	(#rxq7g5q) It'll track a bunch of finger(1) endpoints and let you see what's new. Very early draft. Not actually a social network, more an anti-social network for ‚Äò80s CompSci transplants. :-)
2022-06-06T21:48:06-07:00	I'll likely take this down soonish as I think it's pretty bad for usability, but as a fun hack, one of my weird side projects web pages now has monitor burn-in: http://txtpunk.com/index.html
2022-07-29T22:07:41-07:00	Watching the ISS fade out in the sky as it moves into earth's shadow remains one of the coolest things in the world.
2022-07-29T23:44:33-07:00	(#jvgedja) No, I wasn't set up for it. I wasn't expecting to see the ISS at all, and you never know when an orbit will do the fade out thing.
2022-08-25T19:14:14-07:00	If I have an image that has clearly been na√Øvely upscaled, is there a program that can reasonably reliably tell me what the "true" size is?
2022-09-26T23:09:01-07:00	TIL there's a Director's Cut of Miley Cyrus's Wrecking Ball video and it's much better than the original.
2022-10-19T19:29:47-07:00	I was just reminded of this interpreter for an APL/J-like language by Arthur Whitney, the absolute weirdest bit of C code I've actually gotten something out of, and thought I'd share: https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Essays/Incunabulum
2022-12-29T21:17:47-08:00	One of the frustrating parts of using twtxt for conversations is the URLs are, well... ugly. Anyone (like y'all yarn folks) looked at using webfinger for translating user@domain accounts to URLs?
2023-02-12T22:42:40-08:00	I needed something to help with a morning schedule for two kiddos. It highlights the current 5-minute block as it goes. I think this was my first time reaching for JavaScript for a personal project. https://sidequest.club/stages.html
2023-05-16T13:12:38-07:00	TIL my high school publishes its own research journal. https://www.pingry.org/our-community/students/pingry-community-research-pcr-journal
2023-11-10T22:45:25-08:00	Spent a few hours the last two evenings fighting with tftpd. Party like it's 1999!
2024-01-01T00:56:51-08:00	First task of 2024: renew an expired cert. I like that it's calendar-themed.
2024-01-04T21:33:39-08:00	Huh. At some point, my twtxt-via-ssh shortcut from my phone stopped working. It does again now! I've changed nothing. Yay black boxes! ü§∑üèª
2024-01-05T11:39:08-08:00	I've added myself to the registries at registry.twtxt.org and twtxt.tilde.institute. I wonder if there's a list of registries. #meta
2024-01-26T14:02:36-08:00	Well crap. I think I just realized that if my profile photo was a person it could vote in this year‚Äôs election. Probably time for a new default one.
2024-01-31T19:02:30-08:00	FOR SOME REASON I'm now archiving my plan files (as shown via 'finger a@9srv.net') at http://a.9srv.net/plans
2024-03-06T16:03:33-08:00	I wrote up a lab report on my daily to-do tracking "system", mostly so I could stop thinking about it. The report is at http://a.9srv.net/reports/daily.pdf and the referenced code is at http://txtpunk.com/daily/index.html.
