2023-10-01T19:00:00+02:00	(#ulrt2mq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> It's nice to explore new places. :-) Reminds me of Mundstuhl where they once said: „Und nächstes Mal zeig ich euch, wie ihr eine Ölpest macht“ (can't find it online anywhere).
2023-10-01T19:15:00+02:00	(#zxmtx4a) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Goodbye! :-(
2023-10-01T21:15:00+02:00	(#wwkif3a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Very beautiful! We didn't have a cool one today.
2023-10-03T09:15:00+02:00	(#a56s6mq) @<mckinley https://mckinley.cc/twtxt.txt> This sucks! Both rewriting and digital number plates. I never heard of them before.  > I think this product started with the question "How can > we put an Internet-connected computer in people's cars?" > and everything else was an afterthought.

2023-10-04T07:45:00+02:00	(#eyc7nga) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Okay, cool, I guess. ;-) This nextvi readme is badly formatted in my opinion, I'm having a hard time skimming it. So it's a vi(m) with hardcoded keybinds is what I got before I got too tired of walking that document. Okay. I'm pretty happy with good old vim (fun fact: writing that wearing a Vim t-shirt). I never used Plan9 and presumably won't do it in the near future either. But I'm glad you're having a good time. :-)
2023-10-04T08:00:00+02:00	(#a56s6mq) @<mckinley https://mckinley.cc/twtxt.txt> To me it sounds the only actually useful feature is the plate renewal. But all the license plate registration department would have to do is offer an online service – if that's not already the case. Solved. Everything else: What the heck!?
2023-10-06T11:45:00+02:00	We were a bit over 30 km on our feet the last two days at around 17°C. Not too shabby, perfect hiking conditions. Unlike forecast, it was beautiful weather on Wednesday. Only yesterday the sun was covered by clouds. It's a sunny 19°C day, but I had to cancel today's 12 km hike as I woke up with a pretty sore throat. :-( Damn!  We came across two grasshoppers, one of which even climbed my leg to escape my mate's photography. Really awesome. The other one crawled over my hand to get away of the photo shooting. Its hooked feet tickled a little bit. That was the first time I got this close to these little creatures. What a truly wonderful experience.  And I was super happy to see the lizards again. There were plenty of them, but I find them quite hard to spot. And they almost always vanished immediately.  [![Sun shining through leaves over the lake](https://lyse.isobeef.org/asperg-2023-10-04/18-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/asperg-2023-10-04/18.jpg)  https://lyse.isobeef.org/asperg-2023-10-04/ and https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-05/
2023-10-06T12:00:00+02:00	(#vwh6u6q) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> That's looking good!
2023-10-06T19:30:00+02:00	Woah, [amazing unicorn vomit](https://lyse.isobeef.org/abendhimmel-2023-10-06/)! Without a doubt one of the best sunsets this season.  [![Yellow, orange, red, pink and purple clouds in the sky](https://lyse.isobeef.org/abendhimmel-2023-10-06/12-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/abendhimmel-2023-10-06/12.jpg)
2023-10-08T08:45:00+02:00	(#wgfzyba) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Cool! Kids may have built a shelter here. At least back in the days we went into the woods and have "Lägerle gebaut". I would not be surprised if that's in the official program of forest kindergardens these days. If I remember correctly, our structures were free-standing, something like that: https://hr-pioneers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_1294.jpg For toddlers it might be much easier, though, to just put branches against a tree.  It's hard to judge the size, but even for kindergarden children that hideout looks rather small. Alternatively, forest owners or rangers could have created shelters for small animals to attract a variety of species and hence create a more healthy and robust environment. So, I reckon it's part of a forest program, since you said these things are everwhere.
2023-10-08T09:00:00+02:00	(#yrrvmia) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yep, ta! :-) The term is not limited to sunsets but used for anything crazy colorful. Often it has even a negative connotation.
2023-10-08T09:15:00+02:00	(#zn6hdiq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> That's 15 to 16 kilometers a day. So, not too exhausting for me. Another story for my mate. ;-)  I thought so too. But we couldn't find the moorhen in the animal classification book we had at hand. Glad that you confirm. :-)  In my experience the "Eidechsen" can be found in rocky terrain where there is also greenery around. The rock radiates the heat which they seem to enjoy. These sandstone walls with little crevasses are perfect. I basically never see them around here and just know of exactly one tiny spot where I discovered two lizards this year. They were immediately hiding in the grass.  My mate's shots of the grasshoppers: https://wf.isobeef.org/i/e8df08a4-645e-11ee-8223-038caf2a765b.jpg and https://wf.isobeef.org/i/f98d9e96-645d-11ee-9e39-c3d3a859e767.jpg

2023-10-11T20:00:00+02:00	A mate just told me: On 14th October 2023 most of the civilized world will celebrate [World Standards Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Standards_Day), as agreed upon by American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  On 12th October 2023 the [United States will celebrate World Standards Day](https://www.ansi.org/events/standards-events/world-standards-day), as specified by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). This pretty muchs sums up the American consencus on following global standards. At least there's ASME I reckon…
2023-10-11T20:15:00+02:00	Autumn is here: https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-11/
2023-10-15T16:00:00+02:00	(#oadtp5q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Well, I was referring to the golden colors. ;-) Yeah, 27°C on Friday, but only 11°C at the moment. This night we had 5°C and it's going to be one fresh degree Celcius tonight. Friday was really awesome, sunny all day long. We enjoyed this at our quick scavenger hunt in the late afternoon at our three-day retreat. Yesterday came the rain and strong winds. Luckily, with patches of sun mixed in, too. It made for some [beautiful scenery](https://lyse.isobeef.org/weiler-2023-10-14/). The advanced training and scout annual planning were indoor events, anyways.  [![Sun illuminating the landscape after a rainstorm passed by](https://lyse.isobeef.org/weiler-2023-10-14/06-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/weiler-2023-10-14/06.jpg)
2023-10-15T16:15:00+02:00	(#u7tepaq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Quite an interesting thought. I'm a bit surprised that XHTML didn't take over. It felt like XML was a big enterprise thing, the rest didn't adopt it with great delight. Also, most websites were entirely broken with invalid syntax all over the place, that even coorporate website generators produced big piles of garbage. No wonder they didn't switch to XHTML as they would have needed to fix all their shit. Or else browsers would not display anything except of errors.
2023-10-15T16:30:00+02:00	(#ya243va) Whoops, you're right. I should have written "2023-10-14".
2023-10-16T19:45:00+02:00	(#oadtp5q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yep, but it's [definitely turning](https://lyse.isobeef.org/abendhimmel-2023-10-16/). It took half the morning to climb from -1°C to something more substantial in order to melt the hoarfrost.  [![Colorful leaves](https://lyse.isobeef.org/abendhimmel-2023-10-16/02-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/abendhimmel-2023-10-16/02.jpg)
2023-10-19T19:15:00+02:00	(#mojeqxq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yeah, that GitHub praise also turned me off, too. He should have stuck with plain Git or at least something self-hostable. The GitHub-lockin also jumped right at me. I find tables quite neccessary sometimes, markdown just hasn't standardized them in a single fashion, they depend on the exact implementation.  Looking forward to your article about simplicity. :-)
2023-10-19T19:30:00+02:00	(#dkilvya) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> I was looking at the European thunderstorm map today and quite surprised to see ourselves in green surrounded by orange, red and violet. Glad to hear that you're doing alright.
2023-10-19T19:45:00+02:00	(#nqqmuga) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> I was giving an internal talk on Tuesday about https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter and somebody brought up this [new stdlib router extension](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61410), too. Very cool, but looong overdue!
2023-10-19T20:15:00+02:00	Today was gray in gray, like a November day, but we went out in the very light rain anyways. And it turned out to be really nice. We had to strip our rain jackets and jumpers, temperatures were surprisingly high. Perfect for walking outdoors. At the summit of our backyard mountain we were [rewarded with a nice fog landscape](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-19/). On the way home we ran into a newt. Definitely the hightlight of the day or even week. It's my first one this year, last year I haven't seen a single one. I only wanted to blind him at most twice with my camera flash, so sorry that there is no better shot.  [![Newt](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-19/08-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-19/08.jpg)
2023-10-19T22:00:00+02:00	(#nqqmuga) I just came across this nice collection of alternative router approaches: https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-routing/
2023-10-20T13:30:00+02:00	(#nqqmuga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hahaha, of course you forked this one, too! Is there any Go library that you did not rework? :'-D All kidding aside, I didn't know that you extended this router. Cool! I gotta check it out.
2023-10-20T13:45:00+02:00	(#yzz6p4q) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Good luck and all the best, mate!
2023-10-20T14:00:00+02:00	Ha, the Clockwise/Spiral Rule is interesting, never heard about that before: https://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html But I never did any hardcore C.
2023-10-20T16:15:00+02:00	(#bbih4aa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Heck yeah, this is beautiful! <3
2023-10-20T16:30:00+02:00	(#iazru4q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> You can't be blamed. :-)

2023-10-21T08:45:00+02:00	Yesterday evening we got a nice [rainbow](https://lyse.isobeef.org/regenbogen-2023-10-20/): [![Rainbow](https://lyse.isobeef.org/regenbogen-2023-10-20/01-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/regenbogen-2023-10-20/01.jpg)

2023-10-21T12:00:00+02:00	(#cqxzvxq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Ta! It means we got lucky that there was a bright sky and the sunlight was reflected twice on the inside of the droplets. ;-)
2023-10-21T22:30:00+02:00	Nice lighting [this evening](https://lyse.isobeef.org/abendhimmel-2023-10-21/03.jpg): [![Crane being lit by the evening sun](https://lyse.isobeef.org/abendhimmel-2023-10-21/03-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/abendhimmel-2023-10-21/03.jpg)
2023-10-22T08:30:00+02:00	(#gf3zsaq) Thank you, @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>.
2023-10-22T08:45:00+02:00	(#qhrwyrq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yeah, silly, funny, educational and interesting at the same time. They did a very good job. I find it very fascinating to see the violent power enfold in an instant.
2023-10-22T09:00:00+02:00	(#mojeqxq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> I fully agree, distributed bug trackers are the way to go. It is just so natural to have the issues and the code at the same place together. I probably wrote it in the past, a few mates and I tried several times to roll our own, but none of them really made it in the end. We learned a lot, though. Thanks for recommending git-bug, I'll take a close look at this and see whether that suits my needs.
2023-10-22T09:15:00+02:00	Where the heck are all these tiny flies coming from? For weeks I'm murdering numerous of them each and every day.
2023-10-23T18:00:00+02:00	(#a2mh5sq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> They look like (and probably are just) fruit flies.
2023-10-23T18:15:00+02:00	(#n2tlggq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Haha, for a moment it looked like you goot Nanook on a fishing rod. :-D
2023-10-23T18:30:00+02:00	(#m6xbabq) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> Totally depends on the use case. E.g. for internal stuff that only club members should be able to access this is the way to go.
2023-10-24T20:00:00+02:00	(#a2mh5sq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Hahaha, no, not a typo. :-) Carved four more notches into my revolver grip today.
2023-10-24T20:15:00+02:00	It was gray and rained the whole day, that was actually very nice and calming. So after work I decided to go for a one a half hours [rain stroll](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-24/). On the way home the sun came out to set. The rainbow fell victim to the autofocus, though. In fact, easily half of the photos were totally ruined. Not sure what's going on with that cam.  [![Low hanging clouds](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-24/08-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-24/08.jpg)
2023-10-26T18:30:00+02:00	(#5ppulla) That's a cool idea, @<evil_bob https://codemadness.org/twtxt.txt>!
2023-10-26T18:45:00+02:00	(#p3wvpva) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Never heard of that one.
2023-10-26T19:00:00+02:00	Saw a dead fire salamander in the forest. :-(
2023-10-26T20:00:00+02:00	(#5ppulla) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I have no idea. Maybe from https://twtxt.net/twt/ffokk2a. :-?
2023-10-26T20:15:00+02:00	(#yhycvyq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yeah, getting things under the keys is very annoying.
2023-10-27T19:00:00+02:00	(#7bhzgaq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> How far off was your GPS location?
2023-10-27T19:15:00+02:00	(#5ppulla) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> He's not following me (or at least not advertising his feed in the `User-Agent` header), so he probably doesn't resolve this mystery.
2023-10-28T00:00:00+02:00	(#7bhzgaq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Indeed, that's terrible! Back in the days when my mate recorded the bike tours, we noticed that sometimes the reception was really poor. Whenever it took about three to five minutes or so until the location was found, we knew, the GPX is not going to be great that day. Sometimes there was a jump of several kilometers right after starting the track when we couldn't be bothered to wait for enough satellite contact. Our top speed was astronomically high. :-D
2023-10-30T19:00:00+01:00	(#sd4uygq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yeah, basically it took the last known point from whenever that was (some hours ago when the phone had GPS reception) and then jumped to the real location, once that was known. That's why we travelled highspeed. :-) On bad days the accuracy was off by at most 40-50 meters I'd say. Usually it was relatively close to reality, in the range of 2-15 meters.
2023-10-30T19:15:00+01:00	(#ttg3rma) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Apart from some lovely shop time I was super lazy on the weekend. But today I walked 11.5 km in two hours. Unfortunately, it started to rain. I didn't look at the weather forecast, so I was underprepared. A hunter in a high seat told me to have a lamp on in the dark. It's now hunting season again.  Oh, home-made pizza is brilliant.
2023-10-30T19:30:00+01:00	(#xhjue2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Great, my congratulations! What does <700 mean?
2023-10-30T19:45:00+01:00	(#p3wvpva) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Ah. Did you try Ubuntu? That's also a Debian derivative and claims to be super user-friendly. At least in the past there was Kubuntu which shipped KDE instead of GNOME or Unity or whatever it is these days that Ubuntu defaults to. Personally, I use Debian.
2023-10-30T21:00:00+01:00	(#sd4uygq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Ah, that's interesting! In my mind it even makes perfectly sense to just assume the last known position in lots of scenarios. The user might just be still (roughly) at the same location before the device was turned off. What alternative does the GPS tracking application have when a track should be recorded? Refusing to start the tracking until GPS signals are received isn't very user-friendly either. Usually, we waited until the location was figured out, so that the resulting GPX was somewhat reasonable. But sometimes we just began our tour while the device was still calculating the current position. And then we went supersonic. :-D
2023-10-31T14:15:00+01:00	(#sd4uygq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Oh, I didn't know that!
2023-10-31T14:30:00+01:00	(#p3wvpva) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Cool, that sounds actually promising. I started out with Debian, went to Kubuntu for now unknown reasons and then broke something with every upgrade. So after four or five times I went back to Debian and never had these kind of troubles. Yeah, snaps are from hell, I don't like them either.
2023-10-31T14:45:00+01:00	(#xhjue2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What's this rating? You scored under 700 points? :-?
2023-10-31T18:45:00+01:00	(#sd4uygq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Good question. Probably exactly as you described it.
2023-10-31T19:00:00+01:00	I called it quits relatively early this afternoon, so I could take advantage of the remaining daylight on my three and a half hours long hike. In contrast to yesterday, I was prepared for all the rain, much better, let me tell you. The low hanging clouds are always very nice to watch. It's the time of the crazy people again. When I photographed the decorated house, a car pulled up and was nice enough to wait for me to finish before parking in front of that house. Much appreciated. When I arrived back in the so called civilization, tons of parents crowded the streets with their brats to hunt for sweets in the neighborhoods. I should have taken a few hours longer tour…  [![Resurrected castle wall in front of trees with low hanging clouds in the background](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-31/37-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-31/37.jpg)  https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-31/
2023-10-31T19:15:00+01:00	(#hz2qwyq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Awesome! Being in the outdoors is just great fun. We office workers definitely need some exercise.
2023-10-31T22:30:00+01:00	(#ttg3rma) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Holy cow, they shot the dog? Did I get this correctly? Or was it another animal (boar, deer, etc.) the dog was barking at and that the hunters then culled?  The scariest moment I encountered was yesterday when I nearly fell down twice that incredibly steep hill in the pitch-black. I didn't want to walk on the footpath next to the country road, so I took an extremely long detour (like eight, nine, ten times longer) through the woods. Totally worth, though. :-)
2023-10-31T22:45:00+01:00	(#hz2qwyq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> So true!
2023-11-01T08:00:00+01:00	(#ttg3rma) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Ah, so probably regular hunting.

2023-11-03T17:15:00+01:00	(#qjg42kq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Enjoy!  My mate and I just went into the woods. Although the weather forecast said nothing about rain, five minutes into the walk it started to drizzle lightly and got worse and worse. Wearing a regular jacket without a hood it was quite unpleasant. Especially at just 8°C. So we then returned earlier. Surprisingly the inside of my jacket's pocket was still bone dry, didn't expect that at all. I feared my camera was soaked, too, just like all the rest. A few minutes before coming home, the rain stopped. Our 1:30 hours long trip was really bad timing.  I guess I clean up here a bit on the weekend. :-/
2023-11-05T12:30:00+01:00	It just looks so cool when squalls stir up leaves. Colorful spots flying all around. Quite hard to capture on film, though. Several people took advantage of the autumn storm and flew their kites. Currently, the conditions are absolutely perfect for that. We usually don't get a lot of wind that's suitable for that kind of fun. A sharp-edged and gale-force-accelerated leaf nearly cut my lip open. Never had anything like that happen before.  [![Donkey](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-11-05/09-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-11-05/09.jpg)  More photos of today's trip to the dairy farm: https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-11-05/

2023-11-10T17:30:00+01:00	Very windy and chilly today. Wearing beanies was a great idea. In the forest it was super calm and the sun made us sweat like a pig. Visibility was very good, but all these zoomed in photos turned out to be shit.

Funny that the clock is as gray as the outside right now. ;-) These days this resolution is indeed sufficient for me, but if I had a train to catch, seconds do count. It doesn't matter too much if you're at the station a couple of minutes earlier because it's delayed anyways. But public transport is always on time when you're late. It's a strict rule. Nah, even required by law.

2023-11-18T23:15:00+01:00	(#5rrjaoa) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> The only reliable way to let the other party know is to write an e-mail or any other out of bounds communication mechansim. There's just the User-Agent header in the discoverability extension of Twtxt itself that comes close: https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/discoverability.html But it requires feed operators to actually play along and check. Active pushes are prone to spam, so I actually view the lack thereof as a good thing.
2023-11-19T22:00:00+01:00	I just measured on a map that I [hiked 22.5 km in 5:30 hours today](https://lyse.isobeef.org/wanderung-auf-den-hohenrechberg-2023-11-19/). And I took 723 photos (yes, I'm totally insane; for your viewing pleasure I reduced them to only 96), which resulted in a lot of stops and a bunch of wasted time. I reckon I haven't done this trip often enough, because I took the wrong turn-off – twice, on the way there and back – which cost me several extra kilometers. Well, I was just enjoying myself in nature, so that wasn't bad at all. It just meant that I wouldn't be home before dark. And that's totally fine with me. Maybe next time I care to remember to walk the more direct route. We'll see.  The golden autumn is so fricking beautiful. It only rained in the morning, so I left right after lunch. We then had a good mix of clouds and sunshine. At the beginning, the sun was out for at most 10 seconds in a row before the next cloud covered it up again. My camera takes longer than that to boot, so I missed a ton of opportunities. But judging by the number of photos, it didn't hurt at all.  9 and 10 is a common kestral. I could figure that out based on another photo which had good colors but was very blurry. Unfortuntately, the deer in 30-32 were too far away. A few hundred meters I'd say. I had to think of Rapunzel in 84-86. :-)  After dawn and one and a half completely drained batteries I walked past a bunch of trees and wondered what kind of birds were sitting on them. They didn't look like ravens or something similar. Suddenly, 20-30 red kites flew up (their V-shaped tails made it crystal clear). I have never seen so many of them in a flock. Not even close. That was super cool to watch. Much later after dark I also saw a bat flying over my head. Nice way to end this trip.  [![Golden autumn](https://lyse.isobeef.org/wanderung-auf-den-hohenrechberg-2023-11-19/13-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/wanderung-auf-den-hohenrechberg-2023-11-19/13.jpg) [![Ruin on Mt.

The only downside is that spammers also like that link. :-( So if built into e.g. yarnd, it should be probably opt-in and it might only really work well with single-user instances. At least it's not obvious to me which address that e-mail reply button would use when multiple people are involved in a conversation. The original author's? The last commentator's?

[Turns out, that walks over all positional arguments](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/306944). So I reckon my `for i in "$@"; do` can now be shorter from now on.

2023-11-28T19:00:00+01:00	(#ngkm4ya) The snowplow just drove by. Only to salt, though.

2023-11-30T17:15:00+01:00	(#fbgdevq) Up on the [mountains there was snow](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-11-30/). Could already been seen from down here. The path was very slick. Heaps of people tramped down the snow and teamed up with the sun to transform it into ice. I was glad that I wore my good hiking boots. I cannot imagine how the mountain restaurant owner's car will come down this evening without sliding off that steep, icy road. I haven't seen tire chains and said forest trail is never gritted.  [![Snowman with snowchild](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-11-30/16-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-11-30/16.jpg)

2023-12-01T10:15:00+01:00	Why is there no great possibility in HTML to enter a timestamp with timezone information? HTML5 brings us a nice timestamp input widget with `<input type="datetime-local">`. But that's just local time, whatever that might be on the client. What kind of fool came up with this? Almost good, mostly bad. Now I have the option to add custom timezone select boxes next to the timestamp input fields (or just one timestamp select box in front of all timestamp fields) or just ignore that useless HTML5 crap and go with an `<input type="text">` instead. Sigh.
2023-12-01T17:45:00+01:00	(#7hvbypa) My camera fell down on the bathroom tiles and now my corners are black. Looks like the aperture got moved or so. Anyways, we [played in 20 cm snow up on the mountain](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-12-01/). With all that snow it was much easier to get up and down. But the restaurant car didn't make it today. The way home is mostly downhill, so we had good fun taking running starts and sliding a few meters down the streets. Every now and then suddenly our boot got good grip again and we nearly layed down on our faces.  [![Snowman and car that didn't manage to climb the steep road](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-12-01/06-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-12-01/06.jpg)

2023-12-18T19:45:00+01:00	This was a beautiful first day of vacation. The sun was out, no clouds in sight and temperatures maxed out at 6°C. There was hardly any wind (except for up at the summit), so a beanie was all that was needed. I stripped the scarf and gloves pretty quickly. I took 651 shots of the nice scenery and was even rewarded with a beautiful sunset. Going through all the photos took me close to two hours. That sucked. But now you can enjoy the [84 photos](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-12-18/)!  ![Sun shining through the forest](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-12-18/19-vorschau.jpg)

I'm glad you like them.  I was also a bit surprised and even had to crop 73, there was even more black around. :-) I uploaded [the original](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-12-18/54.JPG) for better wallpaper experience (it probably only shows how crappy the details really are).
2023-12-18T22:15:00+01:00	(#a6nrqza) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> These are called compound nouns, or in German "zusammengesetzte Substantive". In this case, "Wald" means "forest" and "Spaziergang" is "stroll" or "walk". It basically works with any nouns. You just take two or more existing nouns and put them together. Unlike English, where you often invent completely new words, in German you just reuse what you already have. With globalization, though, English terms are often just adopted. Sometimes you need a linking "s" or "Fugen-s" as the Germans call it. E.g. in "Abfahrt**s**zeit" (departure time). I'm sure there are rules when to put one, but I honestly have no clue, I just know when I have to use one. :-) It's the thing with mother tongue.  If compound nouns get long and hard to read, one can also put hyphens between them. "Wald-Spaziergang" would also be valid. But, I usually prefer the version without the dashes, especially if only two nouns are involved. Unfortunately, a looot of people neither use a dash nor write them together, but they place a space in between instead, just like lots of other languages, English included, do. But that's wrong, it's called a "Deppenleerzeichen" (funnily also a compound noun), literally a "fool's space".  There are a few cases where a space completely changes the meaning. My most favorite one is a advertisement for a mobile phone contract saying "Ohne Grund Gebühr". That means "Charge for no reason". What they meant instead was "Ohne Grundgebühr", "Without basic fee". :-D  Unfortunately, I do not know of any lists explaining German compound nouns, but let's see what I can dig up. :-)

They also list common examples.

I don't want to go overboard, though, it's just a laundry after all.  Hence, I only filled a few holes in the screed before wacking on the paint. Could have easily spent multiple hours for the entire room to make it much smoother. That would have helped with painting. I had to press the roller down quite hard to get the coating into all those fine cracks and holes, the screed was finished rather roughly. Quite exhausting and I even partially broke the paint roller handle. Whoops.
2023-12-27T19:30:00+01:00	Holy moly, this is a fantastic 37C3 talk about security researchers getting attacked and they reverse-engineer and fully disclose the entire – very advanced – attack. [Operation Triangulation: What You Get When Attack iPhones of Researchers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VWNUUldBEE) Very impressive!
2023-12-28T17:45:00+01:00	(#pq4irfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt> Thank you!
2023-12-28T18:00:00+01:00	(#bvpczda) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Despite that these AoC math text problems are rather silly in my opinion (reminds me of an exercise in our math book where somebody wanted to carry a railroad rail around an L-shaped corner in the house and the question was how long that rail could be so that it still fits — sure, we've all carried several meter long railroad rails in our houses by ourselves numerous times…), these algorithms are really neat!
2023-12-29T09:45:00+01:00	(#rskibqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Fingers crossed!
2023-12-29T10:00:00+01:00	(#bf54ndq) @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt> Cool! Time to fix your feed then, too. ;-)
2023-12-29T13:30:00+01:00	Any recommendations for decent metal shelves? The stuff in the local hardware stores is total junk. Flimsy as hell. Don't need a pallet rack, but something in between for the laundry/storage room.
2023-12-30T09:00:00+01:00	(#dq5547a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> It's only my first one so far, too. There haven't been any recordings yet the last time I checked three days ago. :-)
2023-12-30T09:15:00+01:00	(#qqietra) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> It's just that the story around the spec is superfluous in my opinion. But I only checked the first three days, it just got too silly.
2023-12-30T09:30:00+01:00	(#t7jg5la) @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt> With [this Python script](lyse.isobeef.org/tmp/fixnewlines.py) I (hopefully) [fixed your current feed](https://lyse.isobeef.org/tmp/fixedjason.txt). Not sure, though, where the last empty line in the resulting file comes from (I simply removed it manually).
2023-12-30T09:45:00+01:00	(#herbjda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Half a meter is quite a bit narrow.  I might just build one out of timber. The websites I found so far sell either scrap metal as well, their reviews look highly suspicious or the shelves are ridiculously expensive.

2023-12-31T08:45:00+01:00	(#tbiu7hq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> I totally forgot about that. Maybe the exact problem to solve was different, it's been too long ago. I only remember being upset about yet another unworldly text book exercise. They could have just used a board and all was good. Why on earth a railway rail? O_o
2023-12-31T09:00:00+01:00	(#z67c5ca) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Oh, we're far from having snow anytime soon. Five centimeters is the most we can ask for. Enjoy while it lasts. :-)

2023-12-31T23:45:00+01:00	Es ist soweit, die Welt geht nun endlich völlig unter. Komplettes Dauerfeuer aus allen Rohren. Mal gespannt, in was für ner gigantischen Müllkippe wir uns morgen befinden werden. Weil, wieso auch den eigenen Scheißdreck aufsammeln, wenn man den ganzen Dreck bei anderen Leuten vor m Haus veranstalten kann?!
2024-01-01T10:00:00+01:00	(#vknqpza) @<mckinley https://mckinley.cc/twtxt.txt> Hahaha, finally! :-D
2024-01-01T10:15:00+01:00	(#sqeybaa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> At which time was that captured? Surprisingly low activities compared to what we experienced here. I didn't look out, but only judging by noise level.
2024-01-01T10:30:00+01:00	(#t7jg5la) I don't know what you did, @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt>, but your last twt uses several spaces instead of a tab to separate timestamp and message, rendering this entry invalid. :-? Maybe you need to switch to a proper editor (configuration). ;-)
2024-01-01T10:45:00+01:00	(#pqhhcpq) Healthy 2024 everyone.
2024-01-01T12:00:00+01:00	(#sqeybaa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Hmmm, you're really lucky. They went completely berserk down here. I didn't capture anything, but it felt like at least five times more than in your clips. :-( It also hears like they spend more money on heavy duty bangers than rockets each year. Anyways, let's investigate all the aftermath on the way to the woods.
2024-01-01T15:00:00+01:00	(#v65hjoq) Some cleaning teams have already been active in town. Still, lots of garbage. 01-04 dog training ground, 05-07 forest kindergarden, 08-09 restaurant, 10-12 random street. Yes, this is gun powder and cracker scraps on the car roofs. https://lyse.isobeef.org/silvestermuellhalde-2024-01-01/
2024-01-01T15:15:00+01:00	The nicer parts are here: https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-01-01/ Came across a great spot^Wsecret woodpecker, who jams cameras. Quite annoying, it just suddenly appeared ten meters away from me, essentially perfect conditions one would think.  ![Small creek](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-01-01/20-vorschau.jpg)
2024-01-01T15:30:00+01:00	(#exz3uza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't think so, his last twt isn't shown in this conversation view either. Just compare with the raw feed. In my opinion it's absolutely correct that the parser is strict in that regard. I mean the format is fairly simple.
2024-01-01T15:45:00+01:00	(#u725dzq) Cool, pics please, @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt>. :-)
2024-01-01T17:30:00+01:00	(#y4eug3q) I forgot to get milk this arvo, so off I went again to the dairy farm.

2024-01-01T21:30:00+01:00	(#ghwvqla) @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt> Confirmed. The previous one is still broken, though.
2024-01-01T22:45:00+01:00	(#iz5qsuq) Same to you, @<win0err https://kolesnikov.se/twtxt.txt>! Btw. your twt from 2022-12-20T03:06:16+03:00 is broken, it continues to a new physical line, which makes the continuation invalid.
2024-01-02T02:15:00+01:00	(#gzgh75q) @<jason https://jasonsanta.xyz/twtxt.txt> Let's fork another one. ;-) The entry at 2023-12-31T23:30:01Z uses spaces instead of a tab to separate timestamp and message.
2024-01-02T15:00:00+01:00	(#dq5547a) That's some cool stuff: https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-12020-the_extremely_large_telescope_elt
2024-01-02T15:15:00+01:00	(#iz5qsuq) @<win0err https://kolesnikov.se/twtxt.txt> Looks good now. :-)
2024-01-02T18:30:00+01:00	(#xzxbvtq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Holy cow, this is crazy! My hair froze maybe five times in my entire life. But by far not as much as that. Also looks like you have quite some wind. Phew, happy shovelling, I guess. We've got 9°C at the moment, 5°C in the night, must be well below zero at your place.
2024-01-02T21:30:00+01:00	(#xzxbvtq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Oh my goodness, how sick is that!? What a day you had. Wind picks up at the moment, gusts up to 70km/h, also tomorrow. Probably a joke compared to what you experience. Stay safe and all the best to you. :-)

2024-01-04T10:15:00+01:00	(#ykrly7a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Absolutely worth it.
2024-01-04T10:30:00+01:00	These are some very nice shots from summer and autumn 2023, @<win0err https://kolesnikov.se/twtxt.txt>! No surprise, the sun shining through the trees and the sunset are my absolute favorites in this series. :-)
2024-01-04T13:15:00+01:00	(#dq5547a) That's rather interesting. Unfortuntely, as one comments at the end, it doesn't work anymore. Pretty cool, still. https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-11903-unlocked_recovering_files_taken_hostage_by_ransomware

I never experienced anything close to this myself. Not a single time. Maybe at the very most a meter at a trip with the scouts. Is this a somewhat normal amount of snow in your region? Now just relax. :-)
2024-01-04T18:30:00+01:00	(#ykrly7a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Right?! O_o
2024-01-05T10:30:00+01:00	(#z6tbvxq) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Sick! All the best to you. Severe events increase in number and severity. Some parts of Germany currently have some issues of flooding again. Luckily, here is nothing at all.
2024-01-05T10:45:00+01:00	(#vyp5qoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I had and have to work with Mattermost and RocketChat. Their web UIs pretty much feel like clones to me and they also both suck in my opinion. The threading view just doesn't really work out in my experience. To be fair, I'm just a simple user, it might very well be, that these instances are just configured in a weird way, no clue. But I'd stay away from these two softwares if I could help it. Since you seem to like Mattermost, you might want to have a look at RocketChat.
2024-01-05T18:15:00+01:00	Went to [Lake Linsenholz which is a construction site](https://lyse.isobeef.org/linsenholzseebaustelle-2024-01-05/) at the moment. It's very muddy around the lake, we sunk in a bunch of times. My camera did an extraordinary bad job at focusing today. So I apologize for the crap quality. 2: info sign with tons of typos, 4: rest of drain (Mönch), 5: old rainwater channel across the forest path, 8-10: surprisingly, they used wooden veneers to protect seedlings against being eaten, I only ever saw plastic stuff which breaks down in the sun in a few years and leaves a big mess, 12: counter contruction site by a mole, 18: extracted drain, 19: Lyse sinking in the sand (it kinda looked like solid gravel).  ![Empty lake](https://lyse.isobeef.org/linsenholzseebaustelle-2024-01-05/03-vorschau.jpg)
2024-01-05T21:00:00+01:00	My headset microphone didn't work, so I finally used another – rather crappy – headset. After the meeting I noticed that the hardware mute button was pressed on the first one. As soon as you're on vacation for three weeks, you forget all these simple things from the working world. :-)
2024-01-05T21:15:00+01:00	(#umdksda) I bet you did, @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt>. Enjoy! Tuesday will be the coldest night with -7°C so far. Probably some light snowfall on Sunday.
2024-01-06T11:00:00+01:00	(#dnk2mlq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I hear you! I reckon Monday will be only going through gazillion of e-mails and following up different chats (of course there are different ones, why would you settle on one?).
2024-01-06T11:15:00+01:00	(#r7gdbra) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yes, it's this one lake that had been emptied two years ago to fix some problem with the drain structure. Apparently, they didn't do a well enough job, there's an issue with the drain tower again. This time, though, they want to get rid of it entirely, rebuild the dam and create a spillway instead.  Took me like half an hour to find a photo from July 2021 were the lake was actually operational (I reckon I should start tagging my photos). In the middle left you can see the top of the drain structure. It's basically a big pipe that allows water to run out of the lake into the other other side of the dam. With a mechanism of movable damming boards you can regulate the level of the lake:  [![](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2021-07-17/01-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2021-07-17/01.jpg)  From the draining phase in October 2023, the lake looked like that. Pretty much emptied lake from the same point of view: [![](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-05/21-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-05/21.jpg)  Still standing drain tower to be removed: [![](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-05/22-vorschau.jpg)](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-10-05/22.jpg)

I should maybe spend a bunch more time on creating filter rules for all that crap. Sort out mails from bots into the trash automatically and things like that. A lot of definitely important stuff is already handled. But the maybe pile is still quite large.
2024-01-06T15:00:00+01:00	(#r7gdbra) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Not entirely sure, but I guess so.

Seite 17:  > Diese Ersetzungsregel existiert für alle Richtungen, nicht nur horizontal.  Müsse „vertikal“ statt „horizontal“ heißen, oder?  Mit Abbildung 13 hatte ich erst so meine Schwierigkeiten, die Erläuterung im Fließtext hat dann aber die Sache schließlich nach mehreren Runden aufgeklärt. Ein Hinweis auf die weißen Kästchen nach dem grünen Feld hätte mir vermutlich geholfen.

No randomization at all. But I remember wondering about the same back in the days: Hmm, the fifth $same_artist in a row. That's not random!!1
2024-01-09T18:45:00+01:00	(#5mcapma) There was a display shelf full of C64s in one of our computer science rooms in school.
2024-01-09T19:00:00+01:00	(#ggc42sq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Naja, die Mitte hab ich dann irgendwann großzügig überflogen. ;-)  Ich find das auch arg seltsam, wie LaTeX sowas produziert. Hast Du evtl. `pdflatex` nicht oft genug ausgeführt? Meine Fastregel ist dreimal drüberrödeln lassen. Ab dann sollte es keine Änderungen mehr geben, wenn ich das richtig in Erinnerung hab.  Ja, bei der Streckendarstellung musste ich auch an eine der AoC-Aufgaben denken, die mir unterkam. Aber das ist ein gutes Format, denk ich. In der Tat absolut verblüffend, wie durch diese einfache Regel so viele gute Strecken dabei rauskommen. Hätte ich auch niemals gedacht. Im Leben nicht.
2024-01-09T18:15:00+01:00	(#dnk2mlq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yeah, there was one particular where a neighboring team A wanted to talk to another team B to confirm something long before holiday season and apparently they didn't, because we all got an e-mail from B on how to proceed. They're blocked. For multiple weeks now. I reminded one of A yesterday and I was assured that they will handle it. But I haven't seen a reply from them today either. :-/ I might just answer myself tomorrow. Sigh.  This is really annoying. Especially because this is not the first time it goes like that. :-( So much time, energy and nerves wasted.  Apart from that major one, I saw a few decently interesting messages, not super important, but still good to know.
2024-01-09T19:30:00+01:00	(#b6imcma) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I once saw a similar sized, harmless (as I was told after asking the locals) spider on the exterior wall. I reckon that's much worse, though: https://lyse.isobeef.org/tmp/redbackspider.jpg This one was hiding on the outdoor water tap. One guy was bitten by a red back spider as a child and said that was the worst pain he ever felt in all his fourty years or so. Vomited constantly, heavily hallucinated for one day and then it started to get better again.
2024-01-10T17:45:00+01:00	(#6tepwgq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Some people seem to never have heard of commas in their written communication. ;-) My day was also very unproductive if I say so myself. A thousand sideshows. And it looks like that will continue tomorrow.
2024-01-10T18:00:00+01:00	(#dnk2mlq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Chaos, unfortunately. At least I talked to another one of A and we will have an appointment together with B tomorrow morning. They invited. :-D  Lol, mail servers. :-D How many e-mails did you get?
2024-01-10T20:45:00+01:00	(#ggc42sq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Dann bin ich auch erstmal überfragt. Kann mich nicht erinnern, jemals in das Problem gelaufen zu sein. Nur zu lange Zeilen hatte ich hin und wieder mal und musste dann händisch ein paar Worttrennungsmarkierungen einfügen. Oder Sätze so umbauen, dass die entsprechenden Codeschnipsel (ich glaub, das waren die weit aus größten Übeltäter) mitten in die Zeile drunter rutschten. Alles schon zu lang her.
2024-01-10T21:00:00+01:00	(#b6imcma) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> This spider doesn't look too bad. I don't find eight legged creatures visually pleasing, not even close, but there are worse spiders than this one. Anyways, I'm glad that we're generally in a petting zoo here in Europe. :-)
2024-01-10T22:00:00+01:00	(#uy6vyxq) You intrigued me, @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt>. I have to read up on Fibonacci Heaps when I'm clear-headed. :-)

2024-01-12T18:30:00+01:00	Quite cold, but hardly any wind, so -4°C weren't too terrible. Very hazy, though, all you could see was a white wall. There was a tiny bit of snow at the summit. In contrast to two weeks ago, only very few people were outside [today](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-01-12/). Much appreciated.  ![Snow covering lichens on a sandstone wall](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-01-12/07-vorschau.jpg)

One and a half meters of snow, holy crap, you can't replace the fence with that much snow on the ground. Maybe only fix a few things at the upper section of the fence.

2024-01-13T07:45:00+01:00	We're collecting christmas trees with the scouts today and dispose of them at the green waste site. It's gonna be chilly at -6°C on top of the truck beds, I will tell you that. However, years ago we picked the coldest day of the year and had to deal with -15°C. A very different situation. This morning we even got a little snowfall, first one of the year. Footpaths are covered in a centimeter thin white layer. Gotta gear up.
2024-01-13T17:45:00+01:00	(#ampghwa) Wasn't bad at all. With long underwear, a thick working jacket, of course gloves, beanie and scarf I didn't feel cold at all. I was walking and moving around all time, so I even sweated a little bit. We were mostly done until noon. All in all, good fun actually.  On the way home I took a detour via the [woods](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-01-13/) to enjoy the beautiful winter scenery. The white trees look just so amazing. Light was already fading, in person it was several times better. Tomorrow, I have to redo all the macros.  ![Frozen trees](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-01-13/01-vorschau.jpg)

2024-01-16T18:45:00+01:00	Called it quits a bit earlier to [enjoy the lovely sunshine](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-01-16/) at 1°C. I heard plenty of woodpeckers hammering trees, but despite great conditions without leaves on the trees, I could only spot one. Trying to point the camera at it and it was gone already. When the sun sets, temps rapidly drop. We're currently at -4°C. In order to operate my cam, I stripped my gloves too often. My hands got so cold that it actually hurt. Hottie to the rescue again.  ![Rotten tree trunk covered in moss, leaves and a bit of snow](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2023-01-16/16-vorschau.jpg)  13-15 doesn't show gravel on a tree but rather a large snow-covered mushroom.

2024-01-17T21:30:00+01:00	(#d2lzjna) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Haha, righto! Of course I dutifully followed these instructions without hesitation. :-D Oh, you were very courageous, dicing with the death. ;-) One caution notice I came across actually spoke of "Gefahr für Leib und Leben" (danger to life and limb).
2024-01-18T18:00:00+01:00	(#rnb5qsq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Nice, that's quite a bit! You've got certainly much more than we this afternoon.
2024-01-19T18:45:00+01:00	(#rnb5qsq) Heck yeah, this is absolutely fantastic, @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>! <3 I reckon I have to upgrade my gear. Really amazing shots. I saw a great spotted woodpecker from my window, but this guy was too far away, the pics turned out real rubbish. How close were you in 7186?
2024-01-19T19:30:00+01:00	Today was incredible. It felt actually fairly warm in the sun without any wind at all. We came across surprisingly [plenty of snow](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-01-19/). And ice. There is barely any snow left in town. But as soon as you leave it behind and enter nature, it's a different story. Some parts were just unpassable. On the way back we slid down 10-15 meters on a thick ice-covered road. That was great fun. The flag in 05 was frozen solid. 13 and 14 shows a beautiful stalagmite, but maybe it was a stalagtite that had been melted off of the bench. Not sure. The surroundings were extremely blue today, 16 shows that bit. Very unreal. Nobody of us has ever noticed the lock beneath the red lady (22 and 23). Yes, the trashcan in 30 is currently out of service. It might take a while to come out of hibernation. I appologize for the sound of the video in advance.  ![Lion with snow-covered beanie](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-01-19/37-vorschau.jpg)

2024-01-20T22:00:00+01:00	I really enjoyed to finally get some shop time again. It's been quite a while. But today I started on the shelves.  In the afternoon I then decided to go out and [soak up the winter sun](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-01-20/). This turned into a four hours walk. In contrast to yesteray, there were a lot more people on the way. I wore my other gloves and boy, do they work better. So much warmer! Gonna always bring them from now on.  The autofocus left me in the church when I spotted the great spotted woodpecker in 03. Sigh. Despite the focus causing trouble yet again, timing in 31 was perfect. The fisherman casts his net to catch the car. ;-)  Two people were having a barbie at the public fireplace on top of the mountain. Haven't seen that in action for quite some months now. The fire smelled beautiful.  I estimate the sledder's age to about 60 years. He went down the steep, snowy and icy mountain road. Quite a bit crazy with people walking up and down, too.  ![Iced up twigs](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-01-20/45-vorschau.jpg)
2024-01-20T22:15:00+01:00	(#ure4zba) 11 might be deer tracks, maybe a hunter can tell. It's definitely originates from wildlife. I was the only one on that path. There were no other footprints than mine.  I took plenty of videos and now have to edit them. Phew, that's unpleasant work. Gotta replace some audio. The wind noise makes my ears bleed.

Great writeup, mckinley! Exactly my thoughts, but you forgot to mention that you see zero contents unless you scroll a full page down. Boy do I hate this. Luckily, I did not watch this stupid video.  Why does this generator add tons of `*.ext` rules when it also has a simple `*` to catch them all? I'm not a robot.txt expert, but that feels redundant. If I do not have an ai.txt, is their crawler consulting my robots.txt? I could not find an answer to that – in my opinion – obvious question. I don't want any bots on my site.
2024-01-23T21:30:00+01:00	(#zhpjxxa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Never seen or heard this. So there are crazier videos these days? I usually only listen to songs. Maybe for the better? :-?

Reminds me a bit of [Google using the least restrictive robots.txt rule when in doubt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/robots_txt?hl=en#order-of-precedence-for-rules) (at least you could argue for improved searchability; but it smells a bit fishy).  In the logs I see these three 404s in a row from someone claiming to be their bot:  * /.well-known/tdmrep.json * /ai.txt?t=1704481081.54321 * /.well-known/ai.txt?t=1704481081.54321  I never heard of [TDM Reservation Protocol](https://www.w3.org/2022/tdmrep/) before:  > This specification defines a simple and practical Web protocol, capable of > expressing the reservation of rights relative to text & data mining (TDM) > applied to lawfully accessible Web content, and to ease the discovery of TDM  > licensing policies associated with such content. > > This initiative is a technical answer to the constraints set by the Article 4 > of the new European Directive on copyright and related rights in the Digital > Single Market.
2024-01-24T21:15:00+01:00	(#u54xxbq) Righto, I hand-planed seven crossbars, two uprights and cut the first crossbar to length and sawed/chiseled the first mortise for it. Just have to plane 14 more uprights and 25 crossbeams, cut 31 crossbars to final length and make 61 more mortises. And then the ladders for the [laundry shelves](https://lyse.isobeef.org/tmp/laundry-shelves/) are already done.  Feels great to do something actually useful. Cannot say that of my dayjob at the moment.
2024-01-25T22:45:00+01:00	Grrrr, those bloody printers! Cost me two hours to make it work again. It just didn't want to print anymore. Print jobs were received and then it rattled, stuff inside moved around, the fan ran, I could hear all the regular noises, but no paper came out.  Black and white copy gave me at least an empty sheet of paper. Color copy even printed something, not the best quality, but there was definitely color on the paper.  The first test print attempt then set some mechanical actions off, "Please wait" was shown, I could hear stuff turn for quite some time, but nothing really happened. Neither did I get a paper nor an error message. Just got returned back to the submenu where I left of. That was it. Any subsequent test print attempt resulted in even only a "Printer busy" message. Nothing happened at all. No noises, nothing. So I restarted the printer. Rinse and repeat, same story.  In the end a printer factory reset did the trick. But the "Printer" menu item to do so was only visible right after reboot. Whenever some kind of printing action was submitted, the "Printer" menu item simply disappeared. After reset I could print the printer configuration page. A one-page print job from the computer was successful, too. Even totally acceptable print quality. Just like nothing had ever happened. Let's see how long that lasts.  The manual's troubleshooting section was of no real help. It didn't have any of my symptoms (except for "does not print", but all suggestions were clearly not useful in my case). It only made me realize at some point in time that there should be a "Printer" menu item. I think that's now always visible.  I also wanted to replace the drums, but I transposed a number, so I ordered the wrong unit. Luckily, I only opened the outer box, the drums are still sealed in their original wrapping.

2024-01-26T14:30:00+01:00	(#hav3dva) Just like @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt>, I never found anything that I was remotely happy with. If the use case at hand diverges just the tiniest bit from what this thing was designed for, you're just screwed. I always ended up throwing the CMS away and writing my own HTML and CSS, so I'm with @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt>. In the long run it's so much simpler. 10-20 years ago I taught a casual aquaintance the basics of HTML in a bunch of lessons for her new job. She was not in IT at all, so it can work with patience and a will to learn.
2024-01-26T17:00:00+01:00	Oh boy the rain was much heavier than we thought. My pants were completely soaked and glued to my thigs after just ten minutes. With all the wind we decided to stick to the forest as much as possible to protect against horizontal rain. I first wanted to go a different route this time, but that would have left us much more exposed to the elements. It was a cold, but still a nice, an hour and a half long walk.

2024-02-03T21:30:00+01:00	(#mc5rlca) The first ladder is glued up. The second one only needs its eight mortises cut and it's ready for assembly, too. Six more to go then.

Luckily, I walked the forest paths a hundred times, otherwise it would have been very hard to find my bearings a few times. On the way home I wanted to shortcut over the meadow, but then realized that there were grazing sheep. I took a detour to not wake them up.

So many people outdoors.  I've seen three great spotted woodpeckers and heard dozens more hammering the trees. But the photos turned out to be rubbish.  It was very windy at the summit, but I sat on the castle wall and enjoyed the sun beating on me. I would have loved to just relax there half an hour longer, but I had to be back in time. :-(  09 looks like it's straight from an AI, but the moss was actually on top of a smaller tree. I fell down from a giant moss-covered tree next to it.  Quite cool how much reach the lift's outriggers have to level it on that steep street.  29-32 show the reason for closing the forest road for one and a half months. A tree fell over and got hung up in the telephone cable in a 45° angle. Only the wire prevented it from crashing down on the road. I find it astonishing that the cable did not rip apart. After all, the tree was quite substantial. No idea why it took them so long to get it removed, though.  The entire meadow in 36 was totally covered with mouse holes.

2024-02-16T17:00:00+01:00	16°C, almost bathers weather! Sun was hiding behind the clouds, though. The [walk in the forest](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-02-16/) was very beautiful. Birds were singing, the first bees gathered nectar, all sorts of flowers brought some more color into nature. We enjoyed it.  ![](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-02-16/04-vorschau.jpg)  Who spots the bee?
2024-02-16T17:15:00+01:00	(#4xdp7oa) I never tried it, @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>. And I probably never will after this catastrophic report. @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> E-mail, IRC and Jabber, that's it for me.

I read through a few pages on that site, but I haven't seen a real specification for it. I immediately thought that you can't really change your keys without losing your identity. Basically the same as with changing feed URLs over here. Maybe slightly better, but not much.

2024-02-18T02:15:00+01:00	(#pizpbda) ARGH! All tests passed, but once I ran the exact same scenario in the real application, numbers didn't line up anymore. What the heck, how in the world is this even possible!? Turns out I haven't committed the changes to the database, that's why I still could see them perfectly fine in my debug session, but the application's session of course didn't. Took me four (!) hours to figure this out. Yeah, I really have to go to bed now. Good night.
2024-02-18T09:00:00+01:00	(#s4is5sq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Oh dear, you should probably switch shops. At least the Verbraucherzentrale backs us up here.

I have to admit, my ears cannot differentiate between Aussie and Kiwi, both sound the same to me.

2024-02-19T09:15:00+01:00	(#3c2i2ia) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Oh, I wasn't aware of this! Thanks for bringing it to my attention.  I do like that they move away from one shared variable per loop to an own one per iteration. That makes sooo much more sense. I don't hit that often, but it happened a few times in the past and getting this figured out is not the easiest thing in the world.  I have to read up on the yield functions. From your examples I fear iterators would have been more useful. Let's see.
2024-02-19T19:15:00+01:00	(#3c2i2ia) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> These are indeed iterators. Very weird syntax, though.
2024-02-19T19:30:00+01:00	When dealing with unsigned integer, I always write e.g. `unit8` instead of `uint8`. Every. Single Time. And this is usually only noticed by the compiler. I would blame the auto-correction, but I – luckily – don't have any.

2024-02-27T20:15:00+01:00	(#wwzdyxa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Exactly. But I fear you just don't learn these kind of skills for real life in school. I think overall I was pretty lucky with mine, but I don't have the feeling that school particularly prepared me all that well for reality out there. I would give my social environment much more credit. But it's very hard to say, maybe subconsciously school had a larger effect than I think. :-?  Anyway, they definitely should teach that, I fully agree! :-)
2024-02-27T20:45:00+01:00	Question of the day: What configuration file formats do you all like and use?
2024-02-28T21:45:00+01:00	(#zwpd7hq) Yeah, the lack of comments makes regular JSON not a good configuration format in my view. Also, putting all keys in quotes and the use of commas is annoying. The big upside is that's in lots of standard libraries.   I think the appeal with YAML is that is has comments, is kind of easy to write and read and also provides unlimited nesting levels. But it has all its drawbacks, no question. Forbidding tabs, thousands of different string flavors, having so many boolean options (poor Norwegians) etc. I use it, but I don't particularly enjoy it.  Among simple key value pairs, I like INI files, but with `#` for comments, not `;`. I never used TOML, read up on it yesteray before writing this question, but it looks a bit weird and has some strange rules. I guess I have to give it a try one day.  And yes, as mentioned by several of you, it always depends on the complexity of the configuration at hand.  I'm developing something for the scouts at the moment with rather simple requirements on the config. Currently, there are just four settings. Even INI would be overkill with its section. I selected JSON for now, because that's readily available with Go's std lib. But I do not like it.  Btw. what's your own config format, @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt>?
2024-02-29T19:15:00+01:00	(#h3tubna) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I hear you, that's why I prefer `*` as the bullet point wherever possible, e.g. markdown and RST. Not sure if YAML has it, too. I just know at work we use `-` for lists as well. But then use blank lines to separate list items that are spanning multiple lines. That helps a bit.
2024-02-29T19:30:00+01:00	(#qfgb2jq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Same here. Reading the spec I came across some confusing or not inherently logical things. Maybe they turn out not so bad in practice.  Being also a Python programmer, I wish there would be more indentation-based stuff. I do like that part with YAML.  Oh no! :-( That's bad to hear. I configured ejabberd years ago and it just is Erlang if I remember correctly. Quite a cool choice for that software.
2024-02-29T19:45:00+01:00	(#3syipzq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Cool! I particularly like the idea of converting it into a `grep`-able version, that's very neat. Interesting choice of aligning the colons at the values and not the keys, I think I never came across this.

2024-03-05T19:45:00+01:00	(#gwbdn3q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> No, I don't mirror code from others unless I work on that project, too. But then it's all manual `git fetch`, nothing automated. If something is taken down or vandalised I hope that somebody else has a mirror and can help restore. This of course only works for popular code bases.  Good thought, though. I might have to look through my dependencies and identify candidates that might not have somebody who could help to get things back online.
2024-03-05T20:00:00+01:00	(#iee7bsq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Today I actually received an e-mail à la "I reply directly to your questions down below in red". Not the same, but I was still happily surprised. With my own plaintext reply I got rid of his nice color… ;-)  The only upside with TOFU is that you can easily forward an entire conversation to somebody else. But these chains tend to be quite horrible to read anyway.
2024-03-08T18:45:00+01:00	(#mc5rlca) It's finally up! Well, at least the first part of the L. Half way completed.

2024-03-12T20:30:00+01:00	It's time to rebuild Newsboat again after over a year. Now I have to upgrade my Rust installation.  https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install recommends this very dangerous and fishy thing:      curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh  TLS 1.2 certainly fits the rusty motto.
2024-03-12T22:00:00+01:00	(#a4gv6ea) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yes, Alexander Batischev tries to keep the Rust version bumps fairly moderate with Newsboat: https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/issues/709  I was actually positively surprised that after the outlined rustup upgrade oneliner above, running `make` in Newsboat again worked flawlessly. Nothing else required. I delayed rebuilding for quite some time because I thought getting this Rust toolchain sorted out is going to be a major endeavor. Luckily, I was wrong. :-)  I just don't know if I now have two Rust installations in parallel or not. Or how much disk space I waste with all this. At least the script didn't tell me it found an old installation. It printed heaps of stuff, but skimming over it, I didn't see anything like that. I then simply selected the regular install. Whatever that meant. Researching this topic will be a project for another day if I'm really bored.
2024-03-13T18:00:00+01:00	(#cc5p7ha) FWIW, I read @<mckinley https://mckinley.cc/twtxt.txt>'s notes. Because I know they are not only well researched, but also well written. I sometimes even end up spreading these articles to other mates who are not in the Twtxt universe. This only very rarely happens with regular messages here.  But yeah, I absolutely get your point as well, @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt>.

2024-03-13T18:30:00+01:00	(#xcuabvq) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> Since they dropped the Linux "desktop" version, I have to use it in Chromium. What annoys the hell out of me:  1. In a call with exactly two participants the "View" menu doesn't do anything anymore. I cannot focus on the content of the screenshare and always have the silly screen space wasted on the right with a giant, useless other person's profile picture. As soon as a third participant is in the call, the "View" menu works again. For months now. You can't even make it the default in the settings.  2. Over the last couple of weeks screenshares seem to get delayed for up to 20 seconds sometimes. I never experienced that before. This makes pair programming or diagnosing stuff very hard and way more time consuming than it should be.  3. I somehow never find the chat box. With the old Linux client that was no problem, but since they moved it to the top, it always takes me several seconds to open it.  4. Sometimes the first call in the morning ends up in total silence so I have to restart Chromium. It then works.  5. On live events I have to completely remove all the cookies and login again, because I get the error message that I have to accept third party cookies. Even if the ten domains or so are explicitly whitelisted or *all* third party cookies are accepted. Always get the error. Each and every time.

2024-03-16T13:45:00+01:00	We participated with the scouts in the county cleanup day and even found a whole rubbish dump at the edge of the woods. Somebody must have dumped a whole truck load down the hill and burried half of it. We filled up a complete trailer with that. I reckon you can get much more out of this place.  Just in time for the start of the event, it began pouring down on us. It was very muddy, but still good fun. One cub scout said: "Oh, this is so cool! Walking around earlier on the paths and picking up trash wasn't bad, but this here is really awesome. I really do enjoy it a lot. Look how much trash there is. Crazy!"  It took me half an hour to hose down all the clay from my rain jacket, -trousers and boots. What a mess.

2024-03-22T19:00:00+01:00	17°C today and I finally managed to [go on a hike](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-03-22/) again. My thighs are a little bit sore. Sun didn't cooperate too well with my camera, but the sunset was all the more beautiful for it.  ![Bugs on a lent lily](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-03-22/07-vorschau.jpg)

2024-03-23T08:30:00+01:00	(#tpg7req) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Sadly, you're right. The impacts are getting closer, adding two hours today. Yes, I'm speaking of the RSS feeds.
2024-03-23T08:45:00+01:00	(#ojyrx5a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Thanks. It's so cool to see all the colorful change and animal activity that comes along with spring. :-)
2024-03-23T15:00:00+01:00	I'm not a channel expert, @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, but `idleConnsClosed` is useless here, right? https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/src/branch/main/internal/server.go#L192
2024-03-23T15:30:00+01:00	(#rmhxaka) Ah, it's supposed to be this pattern in the example code, but – to my understanding – applied incorrectly since all interaction with this channel happens in the same goroutine: https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Server.Shutdown
2024-03-23T21:30:00+01:00	We had 11°C and a lot of wind today. I left the house at beautiful sunshine to [go into the woods](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-03-23/). I had to shelter from the rain under a coniferous tree right away for 10-15 minutes or so.  Many puddles had plenty of spawn in them. Some of the super tiny tadpoles already hatched. Unfortunately, none of them will probably make it, because all those puddles will all dry up in the next one or two months I reckon. Let's hope for the best, though.  ![Spawn](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-03-23/07-vorschau.jpg)  A bird landed in the trees about 30 meters away from me and it appeared to be a larger one, like a buzzard. Only at home at the screen I then saw that it was just a pidgeon. :-)  A bit later, there was a chaffinch happily singing and picking on the forest road. I could close in to about five meters before it flew half a meter further and continued. So I made a few steps, too. That game continued for over five minutes, before it then decided to relocate four meters higher onto a branch to let me pass by beneath. Pretty cool!
2024-03-24T00:30:00+01:00	(#6dpqpiq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Cool! `sed 21/s/one/on/ vec.h` 8-)

2024-03-24T01:00:00+01:00	(#bta5scq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Does your cronjob parse the HTML, queries an API or how does it work? I parsed the video list HTML in the past. But it constantly broke, because somebody at Google thought they have to mess with the HTML every now and then. When I noticed that there are actually RSS feeds, I immediately switched. It's way better. Here's my setup: https://lyse.isobeef.org/online-video-setup/ I reckon I have to update this article with the latest achievements of #shorts exclusion.
2024-03-24T12:30:00+01:00	(#qwhv5wa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I might have to look into this thing.

Luckily, with my experience from last time it was rather easy today – once we finally managed to reproduce it. `cat /proc/<PID>/{syscall,stack}` were absolute key again, thank you very, very much dear Linux kernel hackers for these absolutely wonderful tools! <3 The only tricky part left is figuring out why that actually happens.

2024-04-01T09:00:00+02:00	(#jfzitsa) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> It's very simple. Quot Libet is my player at the moment, it's okay, but not great. I really did like Amarok back in the days (unfortunately, not available in Debian anymore), then tried Clementine and switched to xmms2 for a bunch of years. I had a few scripts around it. I don't remember why I moved away from it, though. A few years back I gave mpd a try, but could never get it to work properly.  Quod Libet usually just plays the whole collection from top to bottom and I manually skip every now and then. Sometimes even entire bands.  I've got all sorts of file types in ~/music. Usually each artist gets their own directory, depending on how many stuff I've got, there's usually a directory for the album and then come the tracks. Filenames are all over the place, for new stuff I use lowercase only and no spaces but dashes. I make use of common meta data such as artist, title, genre, often also year, album and track number. These days I get a lot of new music from YouTube and cut the start and end off with Audacity. The last three fields are only filled when I can be bothered to look them up.  Currently playing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS0hYhD-U0A

2024-04-02T19:30:00+02:00	(#vw3qicq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Exactly! :-D Or call it lazy in that case, to be honest. I just got used to all my workarounds in place. :-/ I still want to recreate tt2 one day. I started with it months ago and never touched it since. Too much other stuff going on.
2024-04-02T19:45:00+02:00	(#jfzitsa) Gonna give cmus a try. cmus-tutorial is a cool thing I have to say.

Surprisingly complicated stuff is needed for such a trivial thing as scrolling. I implemented a simple cache to speed up rendering when the same entry didn't change. But there is probably a lot more room for further improvements.

2024-04-05T19:30:00+02:00	We went on a three hours hike on today's 22°C warm spring day. Luckily, it was cloudy, so the temperature was bearable. Tomorrow and the day after are supposed to be very sunny 25°C days, puh. We explored even a new path I've never been on. It was a very enjoyable tour, up and down, up and down, up and down. I feel m feet. https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-05/  ![Bee hive in front of a farm](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-05/07-vorschau.jpg)
2024-04-06T10:15:00+02:00	(#c7cccca) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> If I go far enough there are indeed a few paths I haven't been on. ;-)  Yeah, that tractor moved up and down a giant manure heap. Although the tires spun a few times, it's quite amazing how relatively effortless it looked to drive on that pile of shit. That machine leaned quite a bit at a few spots. https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-05/traktor-auf-misthaufen.mp4 (114.5 MiB) You might have figured, 11 and 17 show also the same subject from different angles.
2024-04-06T20:00:00+02:00	(#jkkowoq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yeah, we thought a couple of times that this loader is about to tip over.  Same here, I've seen the needle climb to 27°C. To help cool off, here's some bonus winter footage I edited today: https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-01-20/waldspaziergang-2024-01-20.mp4 (724.1 MiB)
2024-04-07T10:00:00+02:00	(#zlj6uwq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Thanks mate! I'm glad you like it. :-)  Unfortunately, I think it's just an illusion that it's super quiet over here. Mostly boils down to carefully selected recordings, as I want to share the nice stuff. ;-) In reality, you can also hear man-made noises nearly everwhere. Depending on the wind direction, even in the middle of the forest in the middle of the night you can hear the railroad in the valley in the distance or cars and motorcycles on surrounding streets. There are only very, very few spots where there is only the sound of nature.  I tried to record birds singing numerous times, but even if they're quite loud themselves, there has always been the traffic noise in the background on all tracks, so I scrapped them (I would need a directional microphone). And if there is actually no traffic on the ground, a plane comes by. :-) We're in the air corridor of Stuttgart Airport, planes are still relatively high, so it could be way worse. But recreational smaller planes also like to cruise around in our area. And those propellors stir up the air quite a lot.  However, the snow really does cut down a lot of the (annoying) audio waves, that's for sure, no doubt about that. :-)
2024-04-07T20:15:00+02:00	I've been out a few hours again. I came across a dozen or so forest mice. I heard tons of squeaking and saw a lighting fast moving seething mass under leaves and groves. It was impossible to capture anything but I could watch it for two, three minutes. They even seemed to come as close as 20 centimeters judging by the rustle and moving plant leaves. Pretty cool.  But heaps of people had to fire up their noise machines today. That clouded my overall joy in nature. Once a commercial airliner was about to fade away in the distance, the next one already adumbrated itself. Lots of prop planes and even a helicopter. Obnoxious loud super cars and motorcycles with broken off mufflers or I don't know what. My felt hat amplifies the sound I noted.  Luckily, the sun hid behind the clouds most of the time, so I survived the 25°C. Even hotter tomorrow, yikes!  https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-07/  ![Forest monster](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-07/09-vorschau.jpg)

2024-04-08T16:30:00+02:00	(#ek2fwzq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Looks like it. 28°C here, gna.
2024-04-08T16:45:00+02:00	(#gf6vhqa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> But it's supposed to rain tomorrow at max 15°C. :-)
2024-04-08T21:30:00+02:00	(#gf6vhqa) Oh boy, that was fricking hot. I hiked to the dairy farm to get some fresh milk for waffles and was totally soaked when I returned.  Fortunately, the Saharan air layer reduced the direct sunlight. A slightly older man and I talked a bit how weird the sky looked and he asked me whether that has always been like that. He didn't recall experiencing anything like that in his youth. I really don't know, but I reckon that this is not a new phenomenon. I also don't recall seeing that when I was a child, however, I was also not interested in stuff like that back then. Hence, it could be selection bias. But it also might be more frequent with climate change. 02 shows the yellow, hazy sky quite good if I say so myself. It doesn't compare to last week or whenever that was, though. Last time was much more intense.  Baking waffles in the later evening on the balcony was nice. Temperatures dropped to just 24°C or so. Much more pleasant. The noise level in the neighborhood was also surprisingly low. And no mozzies around, another surprise. Quite the opposite when I was in the forest. Lots of insect clouds that followed me around and tried to bite me.  I witnessed a Eurasian jay land in a tree. On approach it broke off a rotten branch that fell down. The bird luckily selected a different branch to land on. That was crazy.  ![High stand at the edge of the forest](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-08/18-vorschau.jpg)  More pics from the tour: https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-08/
2024-04-09T18:45:00+02:00	(#42f2w6q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> You're right, that was silly. But what do you gonna do? I could have picked bike, well.  At least it's been a thing since July 1997. :-D I wouldn't be surprised if this goes on for thousands of years. The [German Wikipedia article on that matter](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saharastaub) doesn't explicitly say anything about the time scale, but reading it my assertion corroborates. There is a recorded event in the year 1901.
2024-04-09T19:00:00+02:00	(#pgadjga) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I didn't see *that* reply in your feed. :-)
2024-04-09T21:15:00+02:00	(#pgadjga) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I did! :-)
2024-04-09T21:30:00+02:00	(#42f2w6q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Being lazy is what I did today. :-)  That's a bitter, but true résumé. I'm pretty sure that I first heard of the Saharan air layer only a few years ago. I would be very surprised if my knowledge is more than a decade old. This could have been a big enough topic to be covered in geography lessons, but it doesn't ring a bell. Just like with everything, there is always something "new" to learn.

2024-04-11T22:30:00+02:00	Just a few minutes into [my walk](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-11/) I saw a raven chopping up a slow worm in three parts. :-( I rescued the reptile as best as what you can call rescue in that state. Crazy how the the tail and middle part kept on twisting hard for minutes. I didn't see where the raven went hiding, so I can only hope it did not reattack after the slow worm went its way and I left the scene.  The small forest pond was covered in pollen, looked like a liming truck went by. And the other one with the duck was really oily. Way more than last time. Didn't look healthy at all. :-(  ![Dandelion](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-11/26-vorschau.jpg)
2024-04-12T18:00:00+02:00	Hmm, three war helicopters clattered past today. It was (and still is) very sunny and there's just a little wind. The 21°C sun on the back felt pleasant. In the forest we encountered two dead mice on the paths, they might have been dropped by birds. https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-12/  ![Canola fields](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-12/03-vorschau.jpg)

No idea whose war machines these were, though.   The mountain is 684 meters above sea level, so this makes for a difference of about 350 meters in 5 kilometers (most direct trip). Plus a little bit up and down here and there, or more, depending on the selected route. But it's not climbing stairs, so it's much more pleasant I'd say. Kudos to you! The last section is the actually steep part. [Each brown contour line marks an increase of 10 meters](https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=fossgis_osrm_foot&route=48.7343%2C9.7178%3B48.7428%2C9.7165#map=16/48.7393/9.7196&layers=Y).

In Ludwigsburg on the other hand they are very habituated to humans. I was very surprised to see that [when visiting a mate](https://lyse.isobeef.org/asperg-2023-10-04/). There were a bunch of them laying on the stairs and I tried to keep my distance to not scare them off. Didn't dare to get closer than maybe five meters or so and was super happy that they stayed. That has always been impossible over here. After we proceeded, some tourists came by and stood a meter next to them or so. That was crazy for me to see. :-)  Yeah, walking next to a highway is torture. I try to avoid it as much as possible.  Nice! The third photo looks like a Kneipp basin. What's that round tunnel? I love those moss-covered rocks, they just look so beautiful.

2024-04-14T20:00:00+02:00	I took advantage of the last sunny, but also 25°C hot day and hiked in the woods. It was so much more pleasant in the forest than out in the sun. The wind could have been a long stronger with that heat. I was completely soaked.  At one point I thought I better grab my camera out of my backpack, so whenever something comes up, I'm ready. But I was too lazy and thought, well, I just wait until there is a nice subject and keep going instead. No joke, ten meters further I came across two squirrels. A red and a brown one, sitting on a tree at just one and three meters height two meters away from me. If I only had unpacked my bloody cam a few seconds ago! I just watched them sit on the tree and then tried to slowly strip my backpack and grad the cam. It was still booting up when they decided it was enough sitting around and climbed higher. What a silly move on my end, damn.  I tried to improvise some Lyse Street View, but felt really uncomfortable to photograph other people's houses. Somehow my cam produced sooo many blurred shots on the way up still away from the village, it's unbelievable. I scrapped nearly the entire project. Only very few survived. There were heaps of people on the mountain summit, so I quickly left again.  ![Flower bed in the village](https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-14/11-vorschau.jpg)  https://lyse.isobeef.org/waldspaziergang-2024-04-14/  Looking forward to next week's rain and temperature drop to 16°C or even 8°C.
2024-04-14T20:15:00+02:00	(#uim2v6a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Definitely better for them, yeah. :-)  Ah, interesting. Ui, that can hold some water. Certainly looks like a water level gauge to me. Maybe a precaution for a hundred-year flood or something like that. Or is there a dam nearby? Could be a facility to reduce damage in case it breaks.
2024-04-14T20:30:00+02:00	(#svmumna) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I reckon they mostly ship stuff nowadays.

2024-04-18T21:45:00+02:00	(#jmbfhca) Welcome @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt>!  What the heck is going on with the encoding here?! The feed's `Content-Type` header does not include any charset, but I'm still relying on the official twtxt client to fetch and parse feeds. Haven't noticed this with any other feeds. Where in the chain is this messed up? :-? Seems like the "space" is the Unicode line separator U+2028, that we use for newlines.  ![Maybe WTF-8 encoding!?](https://lyse.isobeef.org/tmp/wtf8encoding.png)
2024-04-18T22:00:00+02:00	(#f57rmoq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> That's what I figured, since `ncdu` shows it at the bottom. ;-) But it's actually pretty smart, to be honest. More space for precious content. And the title bar exists anyway, so why not make use of it with something helpful? Also, with entries being in descending order, it's actually natural to show the sum as the even higher number above the largest entry and not at the bottom in another status line widget. 8-)
2024-04-18T22:15:00+02:00	(#3rqaogq) Thanks, @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>! What?! I'm heading straight to Wikipedia…

2024-04-21T10:15:00+02:00	(#jmbfhca) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> Nice, I can confirm it's now fixed. I reckon the `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8` did the trick. Something in the twtxt client must have incorrectly guessed ISO-8859-1 or something along those lines when there was no charset advertised in the response header.

2024-04-21T22:30:00+02:00	Went out in the cold and noticed that taking photos half an hour on top of the drafty summit is not the very best idea. Not suprising that I freeze if there is snow. Gloves would have been actually great, I only wore my beanie. But it was a very good afternoon and evening. Looking at the snowmen, there must have been heaps of snow on the ground earlier this day.  I came across several different birds and two deer. 36-38 shows the same one, one meadow further, another deer jumped across the road.

2024-04-26T01:00:00+02:00	I just found out about `last(1)` and `lastb(1)` while wondering about _/var/log/wtmp_. This can come in handy! The filenames remain a bit mysterious: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/127211/why-are-utmp-wtmp-and-btmp-called-as-they-are
2024-04-27T10:30:00+02:00	Executing all tests of the online registrations I'm building for the scouts takes now 70 seconds. Initializing a new SQLite database in RAM and creating all the tables for each test case sums up and takes its time. During development cycles I more often resort to the `-run` flag for `go test` to specify only one area of tests to be executed. Much more fun this way to quickly go back to writing code.  At least the `service` layer line coverage is a whopping 99.5%, branch coverage is 93.3% (the latter could still be bumped slightly). However, only 17.6% lines of the `web` layer are covered (I definitely should increase this by a lot). This still good test base, if I say so myself, came in extremely handy a lot of times when refactoring stuff. Esp. the service layer changed, web not so much. It slows development down quite a lot, that's for sure. I reckon it's easily five to ten times more effort to come up with useful tests than writing productive code, probably even more. I'm bad at guessing. But the confidence of not breaking stuff is sooo much more valuable. The tests certainly paid off in the past, zero doubt about that.  It takes a lot of discipline to first write all the tests in the service layer before doing the web stuff and finally see it in action and play around. It's funny that I always have to force myself to do so, but in the end, I'm always happy to have done it exactly like that. It once again worked out very smoothely that way. But something inside me wants to fast forward. I wonder if that irrational part eventually fades away.  Having a code coverage report does make a night a day difference. It actually turns writing tests into a fun game for me. The older I get, the more I do enjoy writing tests. Rest assured, producing productive code is still cooler. :-)  I'm also sooo happy about vim-go. I can't believe how much that sped up and boosted my development process.  Whoops, 57 minutes later, this message turned out much more elaborated that I initially envisioned. Oh well. ;-)

Suddenly, three deer took off. One went straight into the strip of trees nearby and back behind me into the woods. The other two ran more into the meadow and then alongside the path I was taking. They unexpectedly overtook me and crossed in front of me to the other pasture. Then they headed back into the forest like rockets. Holy cow, they were super fast. Really amazing to watch.

2024-05-01T21:45:00+02:00	(#seft4wq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Good question. Two things come straigt to mind, although, I'm not sure how low hanging they are. Probably not even remotely.  1. I don't know what these three search types mean: "Match", "Term" and "Query String". I could read the help page (I probably should), but they are sooo far off from my little brain that I can't even think of a possible explanation. My (possibly broken) intuition would categorize "Match" and "Term" to be the same. Zero idea what "Query String" is supposed to be. But then I think a search should be so easy to use to not having to read up on it in a manual. Admittedly, the basic search works alright.  2. When "Match" is the default, why is it not selected? Similarly, when it searches all fields by default, why is "_all" not selected? This technical spelling "_all" with the leading underscore also doesn't look pleasing to my eyes. It's been a hell lot of time that I looked at the code base, so I forgot everthing by now, but that should be easy to fix.  3. Okay, three things. :-D Apart from the search results taking up soo much space, it would really be nice if the markdown would be rendered. Yes, this is probably very tricky, as the matching search terms are highlighted. So I imagine both the highlighting and markdown rendering probably contradict each other. Also, how to go about matches that are part of markdown link URLs, image alternative texts and the like. Not easy at all.  I reckon that's certainly not what you had in mind or wanted to hear. :-( Sorry about that. I doubt it myself if this is any helpful feedback.  No promises, but I _try_ to toy around with the search more in the future. Maybe even look into the code base and see what I can do. The next weeks will be full of activities with the scouts, though. So don't expect something in the near future.
2024-05-01T22:00:00+02:00	(#bmqqzha) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Damn, I got caught. :-D  Btw. how does it work in English? In German it's ambiguous which weekend one addresses when saying "next weekend". Is it the coming one this week or the one in the next week? Different people interpret it differently if it is not inherently obvious from the context, like when talking about dates. I also noticed that sometimes the same person even switches between meanings. I think I do, too. But I don't know why.  Maybe it depends on when one says it. I could be totally wrong here, but earlier in the week, like on Mondays and Tuesdays chances for "weekend in the same week" are higher than towards the weekend (Thursdays and Fridays), then it's more likely to refer to the weekend in the next week. And yes, the week of course starts on Monday. ;-)  Not sure if it changes with dialects. :-? I assume that doesn't play a big role and is the same for all German-speaking regions.  On the other hand, "this weekend" is very well defined as the upcoming weekend in this week. It's only the term "next weekend" that can be problematic.
2024-05-01T22:15:00+02:00	(#7qkv3pa) Thank you very much, @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt>! I just linked the thumbnail to safe on people's bandwidths. I figured if someone wants to view the photos, they just go to the album anyways. If one has no interest, it's less invasive on them.  Picking the money shot is always tricky. Especially since I have been sorting through them for an hour or more. I try to keep at most 10%. And yes, I very often do hate myself for pressing the trigger so many times when I come home. So by then I'm kind of sick looking at them any more. :-D Sorry, I try harder next time. ;-)

2024-05-02T17:00:00+02:00	(#czkdoma) Thanks, @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>. It was taken near the dairy farm. Came down the hill in the forest on the right and tried my luck. It turned out the photo gods were in my favor. :-)
2024-05-02T17:30:00+02:00	(#seft4wq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I read the help and it's a bit clearer now. Still a bit wonky. I will probably have it already forgotten by this evening. "Term" is exact match and "Match" adds some kind of unknown fuzziness on top.  The second bullet point can be addressed I reckon. It's purely a UI thing. Also, I'd add a short explanation for the search types next to them, so people don't have to look things up all the time through the help or even follow the links to the bleve documentation.  I like the magic detection™. That's what people expect. At least I did.
2024-05-02T18:45:00+02:00	The thunderstom is closing in on us now. It just started to drizzle.

2024-05-03T08:00:00+02:00	(#gkwcrvq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> When typesetting our graduation newspaper ("Abizeitung" as we call it), I destroyed the work of a whole day. :-D  I plugged in the USB stick of my mate (exact same model as mine) to do a backup of that day's work. Since mine was already plugged in, the mount path /media/USB_DISK or whatever it was already existed. Throughout the day I saved everything on my drive (I don't know the reason for that anymore). The newly plugged in thumb drive then got automatically mounted by Konqueror as /media/USB_DISK2 or something like that. I wanted to show off my other mate how cool Linux was and how quickly the command line was able to get things done. By force of habit I `cd`ed into the wrong path to first `rm -rf *`, so that there was room for the new stuff. Indeed, the data was ruined super quickly.  When I noticed my fuckup I aborted immediately, but it was already too late. I went to the family computer to research recovery tools. All the files I was able to restore were corrupted. The Scribus XML files ended somewhere in the middle. So then we decided to redo all the work instead of wasting more time trying to fill in the missing XML. Unsurprisingly, it turned out that not only the last closing tags were missing, much more of the contents disappeared. I remember that I gladly noticed the second typesetting round went much faster. :-)  I could be totally wrong here, but I think one problem was that write operations to external devices were not immediately synced, one had to expicitly flush the write cache, e.g. by umounting it properly. Early on in the typesetting process we decided to have each page or spread as separate *.sla, because a) our computers were not powerful enough to handle a large project and b) once the layout template was cast in stone, we could easily work in parallel and join everything in the end. That helped to limit the damage to just my work. My mate's was still there I believe.  Oh yeah, that's certainly the best strategy, @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt>! ;-)
