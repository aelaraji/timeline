2023-04-05T03:01:54Z	Hi guys!  My first ever Yarn post 😺 📦  I already think I am going to like this better than mastodon.  My question is, is this federated...  @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> ??  If so I am a lifer.  Haha and I've been here 5 minutes 💖  I like to occasionally do some graphical artwork from time to time.  For the first place to get all my art and other's too check out XMPP at this address: [xmpp:artwork@chat.toofast.vip?join](xmpp:artwork@chat.toofast.vip?join)   Another question, is this using markdown for markup?  @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> ??  Follow me back mateo!  😎
2023-04-05T03:53:11Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I managed to follow an outside user so that's a bonus, thanks!

2023-04-05T07:20:36Z	I got a cool idea for a bot, since I've been learning the slixmpp python library to rebuild my bot and get off of errbot framework.  On how to make twtxt posts, with a (currently unknown) selection of meta data from the RSS of them, and a sort of (tho I'm sure this is an incorrect term) webhooks for the XMPP chats and have them post when the bot refreshes it's read of the RSS files.  I'm starting to stage out this idea, and I know it will be a difficult job because I don't necessarily have that great of python skills but I think this is my best and most valid idea for slixmpp yet.  Of any real extent.  I will ofc release it opensource at some point on sourcehut.  Workin through the night 🌙

Did you know that the `&utm_source=silverchair&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=article_alert-jama&utm_content=olf&utm_term=050323` part of your link is tracking you and the people who click the link as a whole for advertisement or otherwise campaigns?  [Collecting Campaign Data - Google](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) < for some information.  I'm just asking if you knew, and perhaps what your policy is with sharing these GET requests with your links?  Personally I always delete them when I can.    You know that every link originating from inside facebook app to outside it is appended with a `?fbclid=HASH` and once the client clicks it they are actually (unless you workaround this, it's a pain) not given a choice as to their data being collected off of a simple hyperlink?
2023-05-04T19:33:40Z	(#yfln7na) @<BLMG https://masto.pt/users/BLMG>  Furthermore interesting is that suppose facebook and google are married, cuz they are, and you pop off facebook to a new tab with a facebook click id in the query string (the part after the ?, dunno if you know this, we just met) and the resulting page includes google analytics, what do you think the odds are that 15 more clicks to google SEO hits and you've actually strung together a chain of tracking your whereabouts on the internet?  As you may or may not know, a website when a hit reaches it, the webserver has a parameter field called the referrer (link) and based on the website's own I think it's cross origin request something (CORS) it can actually know the full URI (potentially) of the page you were at before you got there.  This is a webserver thing, just a thing that's there.  So if pages are sending with these query strings, and places are recieving for these GET request parameters (if you don't navigate far from google and on the upper web) then google / fb are tracking u

2023-05-06T02:49:42Z	Hi everybody!  So I re-upped my sub on my domain `the8woodcutter.sh` which is my blog.  It's a [bashblog](https://github.com/the8woodcutter/bashblog) and I've had some cool ideas about it.  Namely my python rewrite of it called [pyblog](https://github.com/the8woodcutter/pyblog).  My objective is to enjoy the rewrite and make it easier to template while the bashblog code is a single .sh script the pyblog is supposed to actually do the same job, but remove the painstaking effort required to read through the bash code (as you know bash scripts in length are hard to read) and add/remove and change your template files AND have bashblog re-render your site CORRECTLY.  Which it is not reliable doing.  I'm going to work on it now ^^
2023-05-06T02:54:16Z	Some guys were trolling me today, it was kinda funny after all I realized they were actually trolling me.  Saying "your TLS is not working, and I get a 404 when I visit your site", etc, LoL they were just messin with me.  But I must say I have a bit ago started to really dislike certbot.  If it fails to renew a cert it becomes a failed systemd service and screws up my other certificates and services.  Glad I learned how to fix that.  Is acme any better?  I've used it but once on openbsd....  #certbot #trolls #tls
