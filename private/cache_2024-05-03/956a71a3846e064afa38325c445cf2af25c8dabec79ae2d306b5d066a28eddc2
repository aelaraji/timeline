2024-04-21T18:59:51Z	Me feed just rolled over. Let’s see if something breaks. 😂
2024-04-21T19:14:48Z	(#oc7xdyq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Goes to show how arcane that system has become. 🥴  I saw in another video today that Microsoft Office used names like `PMWord` and `PMExcel`.  There was a time when Vobis (you remember them?) sold PCs with OS/2 pre-installed. Those were the days, man! 😂  > It's already very quick.  That’s because it’s not running on a hard disk but a Compact Flash card. 😅  My Warp 4 box *is* on an HDD and scanning directory trees takes quite some time there. 🫤  Spinning rust is crazy slow.
2024-04-22T11:08:42Z	(#lnornhq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> It’s great to see so much “green”. 👌  The sequence of photos makes it look like you throw this (pretty creepy) snowman to the ground. 😂
2024-04-22T13:07:00Z	(#6axgyza) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> 🤣  Bug free code, I wish. 😅  On a more serious note, how’s the adoption of Archive Feeds going? If you all were to clear your caches, would your clients fetch archived feeds? 🤔  (I’m kind of thinking about truncating my history, to be honest. There’s a lot of twts out there, many of them out-of-context by now. They’re of little use except maybe for showing that twtxt/Yarn is an “active platform”.)
2024-04-22T13:09:43Z	(#nwv3ipq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> My process hasn’t changed. (But the Gopher hole is gone. Here’s the file from 2023: https://movq.de/v/72fddfd8fe/2023-05-31--backups.txt )  What is your backup target btw? This NFS drive you’re speaking of is probably hosted on one of your local servers running in your apartment/house?
2024-04-22T17:04:31Z	Ich frag’ mich schon oft, wie das für die englischen Muttersprachler sein muss, all diese sogenannten Markennamen zu benutzen. „Ich benutze Fenster 11! Das hier ist eine KraftPunkt-Präsentation. Den Kode für dieses Skript habe ich vom Deppendrehkreuz.“ All sowas. 🤔
2024-04-22T18:56:13Z	(#qf7pavq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> lol 😂  So you don’t feel a bit weird when you say “Windows” or “PowerPoint”? It’s just a brand, nothing special?
2024-04-24T08:24:28Z	I have months of intense security compliance theater ahead of me and wish for a quick and painless death.
2024-04-24T12:42:54Z	(#aiqtdda) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Oh dear. 😭
2024-04-24T15:06:22Z	(#aiqtdda) One of the super frustrating things about this: I have to write lots of documents, but I am required to use horrendous software to do that. It cannot even number sections automatically, nor can you insert cross-references to other sections. Simple stuff like that. It all has to be done *manually*.  Even Word 97 could do shit like that …  [![](https://movq.de/v/163ba9f8fd/.html%2Dindex%2Dthumb%2Ds.png.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/163ba9f8fd/s.png)
2024-04-24T15:08:23Z	(#z4m2yla) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Get well soon!  [![](https://movq.de/v/03106cee1c/.html%2Dindex%2Dthumb%2Ds.png.jpg)](https://movq.de/v/03106cee1c/s.png)  (And thanks for not being one of those “it’s just a cold” guys.)
2024-04-24T15:47:24Z	(#aiqtdda) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> It is very proprietary, yes. 😂😭
2024-04-24T18:51:15Z	One of the Xfce devs tries to estimate how many people use his software and is a bit surprised:  https://alexxcons.github.io/blogpost_9.html  😅
2024-04-24T19:26:00Z	(#d5n4myq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Oops. That’s a bit scary.  Hmm, how many hardware devices have you lost due to lightning over the years? 🤔  We lost a modem once, but that was it.
2024-04-24T19:44:17Z	(#aiqtdda) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Oh my god, that sounds just as awful. Yes, that really makes you want to quit. Such a waste of time and energy. It’s really dangerous for one’s mental health as well, burnout is lurking just around the corner.  No, it’s not IBM. 😅  I won’t say what it is. 🥴  I don’t think I had contact with any (contemporary) IBM software since around 2010. I love toying around with retro IBM stuff (cause that’s what I grew up with), but really no idea what they’re up to these days. Even the IBM building in our city is long gone.
2024-04-25T12:50:47Z	(#uxaaq5q) Well, looks like I’ll be using IBM software after all … 🤣  https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-joins-ibm  (We use Terraform.)
2024-04-25T15:43:46Z	(#jnfajzq) I don’t know why or how, but using `gtk_window_set_geometry_hints()` has the desired effect (now?). Reading GTK’s source code is too convoluted to find out what’s going on here. I can’t find a corresponding Wayland protocol.  Sway gets *very* slow when resizing such a window, so I’m a bit inclined to think that GTK does some weird trickery to get this to work. 🤔  Either way, xiate now sets geometry hints again and floating windows have the correct size now. Finally.
2024-04-26T13:02:34Z	(#6axgyza) Well, there was one subtle bug: jenny did not fetch archived twts from your own feed (only from other people). I just happened to wipe all twts/cache from my disk, so I noticed that all my old stuff was missing. It’s a corner case, but it’ll be fixed in the next release.
2024-04-26T14:09:40Z	The source code of “DOS 4” was released:  https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS/tree/main/v4.0  Not without issues:  https://www.os2museum.com/wp/how-not-to-release-historic-source-code/  (Hence “DOS 4” in quotes, is it 4.00 or 4.01? Probably the latter.)  More DOS 4 history:  https://www.os2museum.com/wp/dos/dos-4-0/
2024-04-26T15:02:19Z	I think I’ll be doing this again:  https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2022-07-01-oldcomputerchallenge-v2-rtc.html
2024-04-27T12:27:04Z	(#d6xdvyq) Looks like there’s not a lot of fancy magical stuff:  -   https://komh.github.io/os2books/progfaq/112_L2_Whatisthebestwaytoco.html -   https://komh.github.io/os2books/progfaq/111_L2_Whatisthebestwaytoco.html  There is, however, a `DosKillThread()` function, which, as far as I know, does not exist on POSIX. 🤔  You can only send a signal to a POSIX thread and then it’ll hopefully end some day, right?  Killing threads is probably a bad idea, though. Who knows which state it’ll leave behind. It’s not like a process which will be properly cleaned up by the OS.  I think I’ll leave it as is. 🙂
2024-04-28T16:39:11Z	I feel you, buddy. 🤣  https://movq.de/v/f67fbcd93d/washing-machine.mp4
2024-04-28T16:51:15+00:00	If you’re using jenny on Python 3.12, it will spit out a deprecation warning regarding `datetime.utcnow()`. This will be fixed in the next release.
2024-04-28T18:12:05+00:00	(#gxolr6a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It’s always been super niche, but I think in the age of Twitter more people have been looking for free/libre alternatives than these days, because Mastodon is a big thing now and has mostly replaced Twitter. Mastodon is free/libre, lots of instances, lots of communities. I have a feeling that Yarn/twtxt is mostly appealing to us nerds and minimalists.  I still love the core ideas of twtxt. It’s great for hardcore minimalists. Yarn.social is great for people willing to run a server daemon. I still think all of this is a good thing.  We have certainly lost lots of momentum, though. Plus, there appear to be simpler alternatives to full blown Mastodon now. I think @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> and @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> are running [snac](https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2)? I didn’t have a closer look at snac (no intention of running it), but if that is a relatively small daemon (maybe comparable to Yarn?) that gives you access to the whole world of ActivityPub, then, well, yeah … That’s tough to beat.  Not sure what my point is. 🤔  For me, it’s easy: I’ll keep using twtxt because all I have to do is host a text file. Dead simple, I love it.  It all depends on what your plans for Yarn.social are. 🤔
2024-04-30T12:36:27+00:00	(#gfajzzq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> To quote from the german version of ISO 27001:  > Änderungen an Informationsverarbeitungseinrichtungen und Informationssystemen sollten Gegenstand von Änderungsmanagementverfahren sein.  Fuck off, you cunts. 🤣🖕
2024-04-30T12:37:18+00:00	(#mehox4a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> My goodness, you have feet of steel. 😅  Yay, geese!
2024-04-30T13:00:53+00:00	(#u6enjda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Congratz! 🥳
2024-04-30T19:28:27+00:00	(#gxolr6a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>  > And I come back to twtxt.net every now and then to read up on conversations that seem to be incomplete in my own client. Like if a new feed appears that I don't follow (yet). That's certainly a convenience that I do enjoy. Thank you for that!  Indeed, I do that as well.
2024-04-30T20:00:48+00:00	Since I finally configured X11 in this VM for [shenanigans](https://tilde.zone/@movq/112361265690914286) …  The original tuXeyes running in a SuSE Linux 6.4 VM and my [clone from 2017](https://uninformativ.de/git/tuxeye2) (which does not depend on a now ancient version of Qt):  [![](https://www.uninformativ.de/desktop/.html%2Dindex%2Dthumb%2D2024%2D04%2D30%2D%2Dkatriawm%2Dtuxeyeception.jpg.jpg)](https://www.uninformativ.de/desktop/2024%2D04%2D30%2D%2Dkatriawm%2Dtuxeyeception.jpg)
2024-05-01T03:17:14+00:00	Damn those fucking planes and their noise.
2024-05-01T04:19:26+00:00	(#ocwsliq) Of all the retro OSes that I’ve got running, SuSE 6.4 is clearly the most powerful one. It comes with a ton of software and development tools. Windows 2000, which was released around the same time, is basically “empty” in comparison.  But of course, none of that mattered. No *popular* software, no adoption. 😅  And yes, things like configuring the X server were stupid hard back then.
2024-05-01T06:03:22+00:00	(#ivuo2vq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, they’re approaching three (!) parallel runways, directly above me. 😞  (The early days of Covid were super quiet and peaceful.)
2024-05-01T08:39:00+00:00	(#ivuo2vq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Of course, those shitheads. 🤣  (Doesn’t really make a difference in practice, luckily. There aren’t that many of them.)
2024-05-01T08:55:18+00:00	Is this “flat UI” madness ever going to end? I’m beginning to lose hope.
2024-05-01T12:57:24+00:00	(#7ovrseq) @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> Not bad, maybe let’s go back to 98.css. 😃  @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> It feels like the current cycle has been going on for a very long time now, almost 20 years. 😩  But I might be wrong here, maybe it started later.
2024-05-02T16:04:23+00:00	(#vrckl3a) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> At work? Not a chance. 😂  Private life? Sure. There was a regular community event called “A week in the TTY” [over at nixers.net](https://nixers.net/Thread-A-Week-In-The-TTY), where we spent a week only in text mode. It was easily doable.  There are some things where a graphical browser is pretty much mandatory these days. Online banking comes to mind. I *could* in theory physically go to the bank, but I’m way too lazy for that. 😂  Netflix is more popular nowadays and I wouldn’t want to miss that, either.
2024-05-02T16:29:17+00:00	(#vrckl3a) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> Ah, right, you were only talking about 24 hours. I think I can manage without Netflix for a day. 😅
2024-05-02T17:31:24+00:00	(#m35km2a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Same here. I’m watching the storm tracking on kachelmannwetter.com 🍿
2024-05-02T17:37:40+00:00	(#vrckl3a) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt> Why not, give it a shot! 😅  I think I even integrated my password manager into tmux at some point. There’s a lot that you can do.
2024-05-02T17:39:06+00:00	In case you need a profile picture: https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/
2024-05-02T17:45:35+00:00	YouTube introduces a “stable volume” feature:  https://movq.de/v/ad0dd48aac/a.jpg  Once filmmakers realize that people just want stable volume instead of SUPER LOUD SECTIONS (…andreallyquietones…), then maybe I can finally remove the limiter from my pipewire filter chain. 🥴
2024-05-03T09:03:38+00:00	(#rc2ehla) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Yep, it’s pass. 👍
2024-05-03T09:11:47+00:00	(#gkwcrvq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Yes, over 20 years ago, a hard disk died. Not completely, only some parts of it, but it was enough to destroy ~30 GB or something like that.  I bought a lot of DVDs over time and many of them have become unreadable. Star Trek DS9 is among the victims, parts of TNG, parts of X-Files. Really annoying. I didn’t have the required disk space to make backups and, honestly, didn’t think they would die so quickly. When/if I buy movies these days, I either make a backup right away or I treat those DVDs as “will die soon”. 🫤  CDs regularly die, too, although not as often as DVDs.  And of course, lots of floppy disks are dead now. 😂🫤
2024-05-03T09:13:15+00:00	(#uguqlpq) (That hard disk was in a Windows box and there was no such thing as RAID or anything similar. Didn’t have the money for fancy stuff anyway.)
