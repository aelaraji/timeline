2022-06-08T02:51:47Z	Time to settle down. Almost halfway through the year

2022-06-08T03:00:15Z	That was lightbox. Sorry.  Images open in links. No embedding?

2022-06-08T03:02:39Z	Image embed works as advertised. It would be nice if image links could also be displayed as inline images
2022-06-08T03:03:32Z	It's a beautiful morning
2022-06-08T04:52:51Z	This will take some time to get used to
2022-06-08T04:56:38Z	Heading off to work. Hope random posts are okay?
2022-06-08T15:16:44Z	I'm getting a feel for this. It's like Twitter but tech focused and no drama
2022-06-08T15:18:34Z	I wonder if Windows 11 is usable now or worse than it's initial release

2022-06-10T02:04:30Z	(#jfhjnza) I don't mind this. Gives a person a moment to pause before posting whatever they typed in there

2023-01-11T00:44:04Z	The problem with blockchain apps and services is that they're so slow, it's stressful to use them. Nobody wants to stare at spinning circles everyday
2023-03-04T15:36:15Z	New machine for work. I get to keep the old one for personal use
2023-03-17T14:44:14Z	Data hoarding problems. Tons of unviewed/unused data sitting in NAS. Trying to figure out if it's worth keeping any of it at this point.
2023-03-21T18:57:10Z	Too many updates. So little time
2023-03-24T02:59:23Z	There's too many services offering AI-enhanced photos. It's like Photoshop but with extra steps

2023-04-08T13:40:59Z	I used to take things for granted. But that has changed over the years
2023-04-10T04:13:12Z	The new 16" framework laptop looks promising
2023-04-10T04:42:08Z	Haven't been getting notifications for my mentions.
2023-04-20T03:54:47Z	AI needs a computer to run. And electricity. Would it survive an apocalypse?
2023-04-28T13:36:57Z	Crypto social networks make me feel outdated.  "Log in with wallet" Options: "Phantom, Solflare, Torus, Sollet..."  What? I feel like someone's grandpa now. The only login options I identify are username/email. If you don't have those, you've lost me.  Facebook and Google started this nonsense. "Log in with Facebook. Log in with Google." How about No?
2023-04-29T02:21:49Z	Just an average day of updating Brave browser and searching for images. Ahem!  "View image results on Bing Google"  What a tragedy.

2023-04-29T19:25:10Z	Figured out how to reply to Twts. That's a good start

Good luck trying to draw them back in when registrations open
2023-05-08T13:31:24Z	GNU Social is dying. So many instances have ceased operations, mainly due to lack of active user base.  I think this goes to show that no matter how good your software or service is, if there aren't enough users to appreciate what you do, then eventually you'll run out of motivation to keep pushing forward.  Breaks my heart
2023-05-10T06:19:41Z	Browsing the web. Battery: 4% Plug in. Battery light blinks, no charge. Check the cable and socket. Looks fine. Boot into Windows. Battery starts charging. Phew!  For a moment, I thought low charge had killed the battery.

2023-05-14T01:42:36Z	Social networks based on cryptocurrencies - good luck with that
2023-05-14T01:47:02Z	When you build a social network with the goal of monetizing it, you've already lost the plot. 'Cause it's no longer a fun project. This is business, and you've got some paychecks to earn.
2023-05-14T01:51:09Z	Most devs and companies only seem to care about user feedback when it is in parallel with their own ideas. If your proposals don't align with their vision, then you don't matter.
2023-05-14T01:52:16Z	What a beautiful Sunday morning, so far

2023-05-14T03:37:14Z	I came across this  [Farcaster protocol](https://www.farcaster.xyz)  [Farcaster apps](https://github.com/a16z/awesome-farcaster)  If you care to look at some of these web apps, they're absolutely beautiful. It's something I would love to try out, at the very least.  Two problems, however: 1. Apparently you need an invite to use Farcaster. That would require that you either message the dev on Twitter (ugh! We don't all use Twitter crap. The world has moved on to better social networks, in case you hadn't noticed.) or you ask someone who's already on it for an invite (cricket noises)  2. Sign in on the apps requires you to connect a wallet. What is a Wallet? A Home for your Digital Assets. Wallets are used to send, receive, store, and display digital assets like Ethereum and NFTs. A New Way to Log In. Instead of creating new accounts and passwords on every website, just connect your wallet.  (internal screaming intensifies)

They're just that - companies. What do companies do? Make money. What are their end goals? Make more money.  But the people have a choice. Do they want to continue using a company's services and supporting them? Or do they want to walk out and try something else?  Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok - these are the new narcotics of the web. Virtual narcotics. You take a little, and you're hooked. They know you're hooked. They know you ain't going anywhere.  What's the character limit on this thing?

2023-07-29T14:54:49Z	Bluesky users sharing their profile links need to understand their profiles can't be viewed by anyone without logging in. Effectively, they're promoting nothing.  Any social network that, by design, requires outsiders to sign up and log in to view profiles, isn't quite appealing. People often want to check out what's going on before they commit to signing up on a platform. They want to know what kind of users the community has, and what kind of content they post. It gives one an idea of whether they might be a good fit, or if the effort is worth the trouble.
2023-07-29T14:58:48Z	I wonder how other people use social networks. Do they have a categorical social network for different types of posts? Or do they lump everything under one roof?

2023-07-30T19:18:04Z	I'm curious. How many people truly believe blockchain social networks are the future?  NFTs, tokens, monetization, revenue...  I'm sorry, but how are your random social media blabbers worth any money? Unless you're Shakespeare or Einstein or some philosophical or scientific genius, I don't see why anyone would want to read your posts, let alone cash out some "crypto" from some "wallet".  And that applies to most people. Sure, your lifestyle and your thoughts may be interesting. But who's going to start paying to view what's going on in your life?  As if likes, upvotes, hearts, and subscriptions weren't narcissistic enough, let's make people think someone wants to pay them with crypto to view their random posts online.
2023-07-30T19:25:53Z	People are boring. That's the truth.  The posts people make on social media are their creative best.  In the real world, most of us get ignored by strangers. I don't always have random strangers walking up to me to strike a conversation. And I highly doubt anyone would pull out their wallet and say, "Here's 10 bucks! Tell me how your day was!"  Yet that's exactly what blockchain social networks are trying to do. The concept, by design, is flawed. Is it the future? I highly doubt it
2023-07-30T19:40:32Z	(#r63zi7a) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Very few people profit from crypto.  Sometimes I can't help but wonder what kind of ponzi scheme these crypto ambassadors are running. I get the feeling that one day they'll come out and admit they got paid x amount to use these blockchain social networks and bring in more people.

2023-11-03T16:36:18Z	Haven't had a chance to look at Apple's new processors.  Truth is, tech is progressing too fast.  Can't keep up.  New products every month.   I got tired of it and switched my focus to other things.
2023-11-03T16:38:51Z	I love technology. But when there's something new and better every other week or month or year, how much money can I spend buying it all?   And if I can't buy it, why would I torture myself looking at the product news and reviews? Wishing I'd waited a few more weeks or months to buy the latest thing, only for it to be outdated as soon as it is launched?

2024-01-16T17:39:02Z	Came across this gem  https://youtu.be/BZNUo7orS3k
2024-01-16T18:03:33Z	So last year I came across a bunch of NFT & crypto social networks and wanted to see how they've fared.   Disappointing. Massive disappointment.   They've copied all the cool FOSS and proprietary social apps and services and integrated their own crypto scams into them.   Creating an account seems to be "easier" now. But wait! They don't tell you about their "pay us to buy our crypto and then use our cryptoware apps and services" trick.  Visitors are directed to download their app to create an account. Once you do that, you go through username and password and all that and then you land on the payment page. Can't use any app before that. Can't do anything else, really...
2024-01-16T18:22:08Z	(#4n4zmza) My question, really, is how is this crypto scam nonsense any different from just paying premium apps and services and using them? What is the point of this extra steps and hassle of creating crypto wallets and buying crypto coins, and then using them as payment?   What value does the crypto stuff add? Blockchain? Security? Immutability? Permanency? Transparency?  What transparency? It's a social app for Christ's sake! Everything is meant to be public! Public posts, public forums, public blogs... What extra transparency features does blockchain add?  "OMG Dude, you can verify who posted what and when on the blockchain... duh duh duh!"  Can you? Can you? And how exactly does that benefit me? Hmm?   Security? Please! The only security needed on the user's end is a password. And some people are too lazy to even create and remember those. They have password "managers".
2024-01-16T18:44:35Z	(#4n4zmza) So who the hell's got time to go through a dozen steps just to make their first post on some niche social platform? Download an app, create an account, verify email, complete the onboarding process, make a payment, verify account, then visit a bunch of crypto social clones, log in using your wallet nonsense, create your profile, and then make your first post?  Not to mention the "unexpected error"s,  "an unknown error has occurred" and "this app has stopped working"... geez! Has it? I must be blind! Is this a braille phone that I'm using?!   From the server's end, I'd expect the devs to take care of all the encryption and secure storage. Blockchain or not is irrelevant. The average user doesn't care if the data's stored in a blockchain or a text file.   They've copied every popular FOSS and proprietary apps out there and integrated their own crypto nonsense into them. Log in with your wallets, stand around in a circle and praise whatever cryptocoin they've invested in, buy more of their crypto stuff etc
2024-01-16T19:10:14Z	(#4n4zmza) I'm wondering, how free speech, uncensorable and open are these platforms really? Can someone log in and say, "Hey! This crypto coin sucks! And the log in method for this site absolutely sucks!"  Can one say that?  I mean, isn't that one of the features blockchain has been touting for years in the past, as far as I can remember?   Farcord - clone of Discord.  Flink - Reddit clone.  Opencast - Twitter clone.  Tiles - VSCO clone.  Kiwi News - HN clone.  Launchcaster - ProductHunt clone... and the list goes on...  Now to be fair, the Fediverse and other independent platforms as well have also copied and reproduced their own versions of the mainstream social platforms. But most of them are free, were created and intended and meant to be free and open and to counter surveillance and censorship from corporations and governments.   What's the goal of crypto nonsense platforms? To make money.  And they do this by lying and hiding crucial information from their victims.
2024-01-16T19:25:06Z	(#4n4zmza) Only an ignorant id!ot or a scummy scammer would want to promote or join these platforms. I mean, what kind of person would go through the hassle of completing the entire process just to post on these platforms? And it is a long process. And half-baked as well. Account creation is a hit or miss.   There's always a catch on these crypto platforms. It's never simple and easy. And it's never free to use. There's always some missing premium features that would ultimately force the user to cash out. Or should I say, crypto out? Do they only accept payments in crypto? If they're scammy and want to remain untraceable, most probably yes.
2024-01-17T00:25:53Z	Here's my conclusion on crypto social networks: At the end of the day, if users want to pay, I think they'd choose a social app that has one click payment and single click log in.   That is, without all the hoops and loops of creating wallets, buying crypto, paying in crypto, and logging in with wallets. That's a lot of hassle for nothing.   Not to mention how ridiculously slow some of these crypto apps are. The webpage loading times are atrocious.   If you're a hobbyist like Jack Dorsey, or rich, and you have enough money to throw away at random apps, then crypto scams may seem like the right place for you.   The entire basis for crypto social apps is to enable users to monetize their content. But my question is, who the hell wants to pay me to read my crap? Anyone? Is there anyone who would want to pay me for just posting my random thoughts online?  Because that's what it is, isn't it? Random thoughts.  They could be the smartest and wisest words any man has ever read, but are they worth paying for?
2024-01-17T00:35:43Z	I think the internet culture has shifted towards monetization of everything. People want to make money off of everything. Even the things that are not deemed valuable.   Gone are the days when knowledge was distributed for free, information was shared for free; pictures, videos, stories, music - all sorts of entertainment on the internet was free. Back then, everyone was equal.   Nowadays, there are creators, and there are subscribers. Everyone wants to be a creator. Why? Because creators make money.  Whatever happened to the hobbyists who made things out of passion, and not with a goal of making big bucks at the end?  They're there. Still there, thank God. A good example is the twtxt community. And dozens of other platforms and forums and sites where people host and create things out of passion. They're not getting paid to do it. They do it because they love what they do. And at the end of the day, if people want to show their appreciation for it, well and good. If not, doesn't make any difference to them.
2024-01-17T00:39:11Z	(#bopzd7q) It's becoming rare these days to see sites without ads, and "creators" without a dozen payment platforms for people to give them money.
2024-01-17T00:54:35Z	I saw a screenshot of someone's iPhone weather app. And the ad took half the screen. Mindboggling
