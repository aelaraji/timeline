2021-10-23T07:33:09Z	Hi Twtxt people! I'm The Canine from @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> Some people say Yarn is better than Mastodon, so now I'm here to test - I guess. I'm and IT student drawing pixelart, have a few sites and code in C#. ![](https://www.nuegia.net/~canine/pixel-art/Shiba%20Temmie.png) Just going to test posting my profile picture as an image here and try adding a few hashtags, to see if those work. #PixelArt #Art #FirstPost #Test `Console.WriteLine("Woah, this place has a code embedding feature?");`
2021-10-23T07:38:59Z	(#phupz3q) Nova, well at least they posted "twtx > fediverse" in a XMPP chatroom we share. So I thought I'd check this thing out. I've never heard about it before, but it works pretty well in browser, so that's a positive surprise. I'm a bit disappointed the image only showed up as link (probably have to look into that image feature a bit more) and that me saying `@thecanine@mstdn.social` somehow got automatically shortened to @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> here. 🤔
2021-10-23T07:43:41Z	(#wslehwa) Glad you like the profile pic. Also speaking of the instances, I was actually wondering if there was an instance list somewhere, as I was only able to find this instance and the We💚Privacy one. There were three listed on your site, but it looks like the third one no longer works. 🤔
2021-10-23T07:47:14Z	(#qjwta3a) I'd be happy to. It's pretty impressive you have an app this close to release already. Mastodon didn't have one for a really long time and only got an official one recently. It's still iOS only and in my opinion useless compared to the unofficial ones, as removing a timeline makes it completely unusable for users like me + the fact I'd never buy an Apple doesn't help it either. 😄
2021-10-23T07:50:37Z	(#phupz3q) I get that, but shouldn't it only shorten `@thecanine@twtxt.net` and not `@canine@anything`? 🤔
2021-10-23T07:54:05Z	(#wslehwa) Maybe you can add Reddit style upvotes and downvotes along with some basic source search tool and get $2 M in EU funding. I've heard that's the winning strategy these days. 😂
2021-10-23T08:05:27Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#lzfgc3q) What is the difference between forking a conversation and replying in it?
2021-10-23T08:10:38Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#lzfgc3q) but I also saw you quoting other messages, so I guess that's the third option that I wasn't able to find yet. 🤔
2021-10-23T08:12:26Z	Message 123 (edited)
2021-10-23T08:48:54Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#7x6gora) You still have a lot to learn from the Mastodon devs. You need to present this as a feature introduced to prevent the spread of misinformation, by making it impossible for people to change their old posts and making the likes (that this site doesn't have*) and replies look bad and all that. *not having likes might be both good and bad, good because I don't have to worry about them and bad, because now I only have the follower count to fuel my unjustified sense of self importance. 😂  But I guess I can add my own like footer: ```Likes: 9999 Shares: 9998```
2021-10-23T08:53:39Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @lyse (#6gszxta) don't think the concept of red/unred exists on most platforms, but maybe it could be solved by the Timeline and Discover tabs having some splitter, dividing the "new stuff" from what was already there before you logged out. 🤔
2021-10-23T08:59:59Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#6gszxta) Yeah it'd probably be better as a client side feature to add to he app. The last post things only works for those who post often enough and never just lurk.
2021-10-23T10:10:03Z	Ah, clicking the "Delete" button repeatedly deletes the older messages and not just the one the button is on. Lesson learned - hopefully. 😂  Also thank you for following me everyone!
2021-10-23T11:02:45Z	@lyse @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#6gszxta) it probably depends on what people want to use this kind of social networks for. I use Mastodon to post all of my art for people to see, as well as to see the art others have posted. So I like to see all the old (missed) posts there. But considering how this works and how much text based it is, it might not be the best option for art sharing, especially if people are sometimes looking in from outside of yarn.social. 🤔
2021-10-23T22:12:52Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#mxjhtma) I also think that you should consider adding something to make the app remember what tab you left it on, before you release it. I don't know if I'm the only one with this problem, but I keep being confused by the lack of discussion in the pot, only to realize that I've closed the app and because of that, I'm now on my timeline again, instead of the Discover tab, that I closed it on. 🤔
2021-10-24T07:35:41Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#junfgya) That's a cool update, making sure avatars stay up to date like this. Speaking of avatars, I sometimes use gifs as moving avatars, or avatars with a transparent background (sometimes even both). Sadly on most sites, the moving ones don't work, so I'm wondering if they'd work here. 🤔
2021-10-24T10:54:15Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#junfgya) I always wonder how hard would it be to implement gif resizing that doesn't break their movement. 🙂  I haven't seen any problems with the image resizing here so far, but I'm always very skeptical when images are resized using anything else than nearest neighbor. Lastly (related to the Android app testing) when writing anything in the app, the text selection for copying and pasting text is a bit wonky, because the default blue dots to drag around to select more words don't show up for some reason. 🤔
2021-10-24T11:01:30Z	@<news https://twtxt.net/user/news/twtxt.txt> @<eldersnake https://twtxt.net/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> @laz @jlj @xuu @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ajh7tqq) That's another (Android and probably also iOS) app problem I found. If I want to check any of the people mentioned in messages like this one and I don't already follow them, I get to a screen with "Your timeline is empty, try checking out Discover to see what's happening on the twtxt.net pod!" written on it.
2021-10-24T11:07:06Z	@<news https://twtxt.net/user/news/twtxt.txt> @<eldersnake https://twtxt.net/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ajh7tqq) Also looks like some of the mentions now show white instead of blue in my reply. 🤔
2021-10-24T11:11:47Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ajh7tqq) Oh, so I need to follow the feeds to check up on them like this. That's also quite different from other social media. 🤔
2021-10-24T11:16:12Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @lyse (#sg36foq) Cool, good to see it fixed this fast. Sadly it seems to have broken the settings tab in the current test version of the app, but when the next build come sout, I'll be sure to re-enter and this hopefully also fix my multi-line profile text thingy. 😄
2021-10-24T11:19:20Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ajh7tqq)  __smashes the nonexistent like button and the metaphorical "notification bell" under the message above__
2021-10-24T11:23:30Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ajh7tqq)  I meant to type that in cursive, but I guess I have yet to learn the markup here as I now see it as bold. **this should be bald** __this should be cursive__ ~~this should be crossed~~ ```this should be code``` Just checking if it'll work as intended this time. 🤞
2021-10-24T11:25:03Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ajh7tqq) Almost got it! Guess cursive still shows as bold in this version of the app. 🤔
2021-10-24T11:54:39Z	@lyse (#ajh7tqq) Oh, I guess it was changed since this app was made. In the app it's as I said: ```**for bold** __for italics__``` But I'll try what young suggested: *method one* ```using *``` _method two_ ```using _```
2021-10-24T11:57:20Z	(#ajh7tqq) or not, as I screwed up the markup so attempt 2: *method 1* _method 2_
2021-10-24T20:01:50Z	@jo (#yjrcptq) Who/What are you? Some weather enthusiast? Someones weather station connected to this part of the Internet? Someone lost in and endless GPS weather void, calling for someone to help them find their way out? But than there is no escape from the Mister Bone's wild weather void... 🎃
2021-10-24T20:20:31Z	@<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> (#yjrcptq) Probably, but I thought whatever/whoever it was was complaining about the working conditions during a blizzard, which made it sound more human. But I guess it's probably just a wind sensor error report or something. 🤔  Still better to make sure it's not someone stuck in an eternal void or something. 😄
2021-10-24T20:33:34Z	@<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> (#yjrcptq) Why not, if it's just a void filled with a blizzard, making any kind of work impossible? 🤔
2021-10-24T20:48:26Z	@<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> (#yjrcptq) I guess that'd still be better than "THERE IS NO ESCAPING". 🙃
2021-10-24T20:51:41Z	@slashdot @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ejig4kq) What an ironic thing to have in your terms of service while dodging a lawsuit yourself (for violating Mastodons AGPLv3 license). 😂
2021-10-24T20:54:46Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#yjrcptq) Poor guy, just wanted to have an automated weather station thing going and when they return, they'll find there is now like 4847 pages worth of stupid lore about how it's a guy stuck in a void written about it.
2021-10-24T21:05:00Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#ejig4kq) Yeah, maybe it's just saying the same thing as the sites like Parler did. That they'll just throw you (the poster) under the "legal bus" whenever someone tries to sue them for what you posted, but it's just worded poorly. 🤔  Still I wonder how they'd even find you to get you involved in that lawsuit, unless they'll also want you to scan your ID in exchange for having access to all the features like Parler does, which is probably one of the reason no sane people are on Parler. 😂
2021-10-24T21:08:37Z	@<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#yjrcptq) Well the description on Twitter is "Geologist, Anthropologist. At the end of the world, investigating uncanny phenomena for B.A.A.L. Project.", so my void guess was close enough to theirs "At the end of the world" and the "Geologist" part implies it's not entirely impossible for these to actually be posted by a human. 😄
2021-10-24T21:19:55Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#yjrcptq) They probably do, or at least seem to be aware of it on Twitter where they follow over 200 other Twitter users themselves. 🙂  Don't know what their numbers are here, I'm using the app and can't find the follower numbers in there (if the app can even show them in this version).
2021-10-24T21:36:09Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#3c6fubq) I wouldn't contact them with proposals, or else if they lose against Mastodon, they'll move to parasiting on the code of this project, by making proprietary text files, with the ".trump" extension or something. 😂  Also they already spent money trying to copyright all kinds of truth related catchphrase, so I'd say a name change it pretty unlikely at this point. 🤔
2021-10-24T21:44:12Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> (#3c6fubq) I also assume it's done to appeal to a wider audience, as after the January 6th and all the drama around that, not that many people would be lining up to be on the social network named after Trump. But like someone said, there's a lot of missed potential not naming it "The Trumpet", doing that, you wouldn't even have to change all the Tooting references in the Mastodon source code. 😄
2021-10-25T06:23:37Z	@<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<eldersnake https://twtxt.net/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> (#najbypq) I didn't even have a problem with them making money from the vaccine, even though it was strange that some of those companies asked for more money per shot than others or sold them for different prices to different places, but than paying more per shot got you more vaccines. What I was the most disappointed with was the unwillingness to even consider working wits some smaller labs to produce more of it, when they were so hard to get. This also kinda helped the conspiracy theories spread because "if the virus was so deadly, would they really care about their profit this much", than the way they worded the fact that "they don't take any responsibility after you take the vaccine" only added to this problem. I'm not saying the vaccine itself is bad, I took it as soon as I could in this country (this summer) and I'm really glad I did, especially when looking at all the numbers and statistics now, seeing how much less likely you're to end up in a hospital after taking it.
2021-10-25T06:31:29Z	@<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#dl7auta) Aren't all social media cloud-like in nature, unless everyone hosted their pod/instance on their computer at home? 🤔  I also feel safer having my data on the cloud than on an SSD/USB like some people do. I still don't feel safe enough, which is why I have them backed up on 5 or so servers and the more important stuff could be recovered even if all the 5 servers shut down at the same time somehow. 🙂
2021-10-25T06:37:25Z	@laz @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> (#3c6fubq) Lazy, but smart, as that way they could probably also re-use the elephant mascot, just add some stripes and stars on it, to make it look a bit more like the Republican party logo. 😄
2021-10-25T06:53:54Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#75yceia) You used to be able to (probably still works) VPN to some poor country and get these services cheaper. Family sharing can also save a lot. But considering a lot of these services are not even available in my country without a VPN to begin with and using one might go against their terms of service, while watching it from one of those free online pirate streaming sites is perfectly legal here, with how little I watch and the fact I watch stuff from all of them when I have the time, at this point I just find it far more convenient to use the pirate sites, especially when you have pirate sites that actually have stuff from almost all those services, so they made piracy more convenient than paying. 😂
2021-10-25T07:15:20Z	@jlj @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#fvdkerq) You might need to check what's up with the Google play store one too. I haven't gotten any update since I installed the app from there and not even uninstalling it and installing it again helped. I'm still on the version 1.0.5, the build without the about page and with settings that are now broken.
2021-10-25T07:17:53Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#fvdkerq) and the **B** and *I* buttons in the markup work weird in this version, both making the markup for bold text, but that might be a thing in the other version too.
2021-10-25T07:40:40Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#fvdkerq) Idk, that downloaded as "release.apk.zip" or something and when I removed the ".zip" and tried installing it, it had some popups telling me about weird signatures and because of that it wouldn't install.  I know how to re-sign android stuff, so I could obviously do that as well as change the name icon or whatever other small edits I'd want while doing so, but that might result in other problems for future updates. 🤔
2021-10-25T08:55:14Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @jlj (#fvdkerq) so you got it to download as app-release.apk? Because I'm trying again and it still doesn't give me that option. The closest I can get is clicking "View Raw" and having it downloaded as "app-release.apk.zip".
2021-10-25T09:00:12Z	(#fvdkerq)  Though at least uninstalling the one from Google Play and removing the ".zip" at the end of the download file seems to have worked this time, without any signature errors, just Googles usual complaining about unknown sources.
2021-10-25T09:03:31Z	(#fvdkerq)  All works fine, but I the buttons for code markdown and such no longer show up and the *I* button making the text bold instead of tilted is still a thing in this version. But I think the settings are working now and I can see the Yarn button.
2021-10-25T09:18:13Z	(#fvdkerq) @jlj  What browser are you using? I tried all the browsers on my phone (3) and not a single one downloaded it without turning it into ".zip". 🙃
2021-10-25T10:00:29Z	(#fvdkerq) @jlj  Don't think so, apks from other sites usually download without this. But it's not like this is that big of a problem anyway, since deleting the ".zip" at the end makes everything work fine. 🙂
2021-10-25T10:03:38Z	(#732ge3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  Yeah, but I would probably be scared to put wooden floor in my bathroom. I get it's protected from water, but still what if it somehow manages to get to the wood anyway. 🤔
2021-10-25T10:18:45Z	(#73css6q) @jlj  Or Spotify, that has a free plan and an app that is easy to modify to let you enjoy most of the premium features. 😄
2021-10-25T11:56:42Z	(#fvdkerq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  I always used the "https:// way" too, as it's the way the link would copy from the browser. Speaking of avatars, would there be some easy way to make it so your profile will show up, when you click at your avatar in the left panel of the app? It always worked like that in the old Twitter app I was used to, so I keep clicking on it, but nothing happens. 🙃
2021-10-25T12:22:49Z	(#fvdkerq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  Yeah, I made one here and added some other UI related suggestions to it as well: https://git.mills.io/user/activate?code=202110251213000180e75196c0bc6d957b8ecda72a64bcd6844015d6a174686563616e696e65
2021-10-25T12:24:38Z	(#fvdkerq)  wrong link, here is the right one - guess: https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/app/issues/111
2021-10-25T12:48:25Z	(#fvdkerq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  I'll also keep adding more UI suggestions to it overtime and so can everyone else and with our powers combined the app will be complete in no time. 😄 Or maybe we'll just completely drain you with suggestions. Maybe I could also look into the code and see if any of it could be fixed, edited by me, but I doubt I could do that in browser. 🤔
2021-10-25T12:52:29Z	(#fvdkerq) ...for example when it come to the markdown problem, it could probably be fixed just by making the _I_ button type "__" instead of "____". 🤔
2021-10-25T13:04:43Z	(#75yceia) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt>  Well I don't even have a 4K monitor, so I'm happy if it's 720p or above. The the good piracy sites like https://www2.zoechip.com stream from servers where the majority of the content is stored in HD. I'm not saying I encourage you to switch to using it, but you'd be surprised how many things I was unable to find anywhere else they have, like stuff from Apple TV or just the old stuff the streaming services don't have the rights to stream anymore. 🙂
2021-10-25T15:20:54Z	(#yp3fkba) @movq  My name and profile picture might be kinda giving it away though. 😂 Even when my dog-ness is debatable, as I'm an inugami, a giant (180 cm sitting), shiba inu colored (sadly not seen on this 1 bit profile picture) non-aging "demigod" (also debatable) in the canine lore. 🐶
2021-10-25T18:41:22Z	(#yp3fkba) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>  I assume you meant me, moveq is pretty penguiny looking (not mistakable for either a dog or a rabbit). 😄 I guess it's because the profile picture is only one bit, so I can't use my usual shiba inu colors and maybe also the ears to some degree. On the other hand, it could be an interesting art experiment trying to add some color to this picture without ruining the aesthetic I was going for. 🤔
2021-10-25T19:01:53Z	(#icvalja) @quark  I'd say yes and I usually don't sleep much myself. 😄
2021-10-25T19:10:57Z	I've tried adding colors to the profile picture. Hopefully it updates well for everyone. Also thank you for giving me that idea @lise hopefully it'll now he easier to recognize me as a canine. 😄
2021-10-25T19:12:04Z	(#ip5vl7q)  Oh, I meant @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> sorry for butchering your nickname. 🙃
2021-10-25T19:41:41Z	(#ip5vl7q) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt>  What do you mean by that? Did you like the previous version more?
2021-10-25T19:57:02Z	(#yp3fkba) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt>  glad to hear that. It's not supposed to be trousers, but one or those leather jackets (I guess that with him being four leged, the line between a jacket and pants is pretty thin), he'd sometimes wear it as a uniform (mostly just for the look, rather than protection).This was the original design of the uniform (and a bit of "hair" color): ![](https://twtxt.net/media/qQecZ6mR8BfzBBYYuQQhpK) For this smaller image I simplified it a bit and added a golden chain from a different uniform design to his right. On some rare occasions he was also drawn wearing pants on his back legs, but I'm trying to do that only when the dress is a reference to some other characters and I feel like the back leg pants would be absolutely necessary to complete the look. 😄
2021-10-25T20:06:22Z	(#ip5vl7q) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt>  Oh that. I guess that comes from the early days of Discord, where there was hundreds of users in a lot of servers and one needed something memorable they could be recognized by, so the use of animal mascots was pretty common. I used a wolf at first, as that was what some other people in the group were using, but I like canines from made up mythology/religin a lot more, so I switched to having one of those as my mascot everywhere.
2021-10-25T20:10:51Z	(#vez43wa) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Surprised no one took that domain name yet, but it would cost you around 123 dollars to buy. 😄
2021-10-25T20:20:56Z	(#vez43wa) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Could be a yarn.social pod made primarily for users wanting to show their passion for alcoholism in their accounts domain name. 😂
2021-10-25T21:35:22Z	(#vez43wa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yeah, if they see you got wasted last night and you're still able to preform well during the interview, it should be an instant hire. 😂
2021-10-26T05:59:20Z	(#fvdkerq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I get that but on Android, the text selection thingy is broken (as I said earlier the fists for dragging over more words don't show up), so you'll at best select a single word by tapping it violently and even than, the *I* will add two underlines before it and two after it, making it bald instead.
2021-10-26T06:06:47Z	(#xd3morq) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> The twtxt.txt files were mentioned during an XMPP conversation about de-centralized social networks we were having, so I looked into it and found out this was also a thing. But so far I'm the only one of those people who decided to use Yarn, instead of hosting the twtxt.txt fine somewhere on a personal server.
2021-10-26T06:15:35Z	(#5hkhcda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I most definitely did, can't you see it in color now? 🤔
2021-10-26T06:19:56Z	(#turq4ga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It always do be like that. Things never come with the cables they need, like the fact most monitors here still come with only a VGA cable, despite everyone who buys them needing HDMI or DisplayPort.
2021-10-26T06:22:51Z	(#5hkhcda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I always update my avatars while using the mobile app - they go together. (sorry for the bad joke, couldn't help it)
2021-10-26T06:42:11Z	(#fvdkerq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ok, it's at: https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/app/issues/112#issue-1677 Hope it helps as a reminder, but I doubt you can get anything I haven't already said here out of it, except the two screenshots I added.
2021-10-26T07:01:55Z	Avatar refreshed, can you all see it in color now?
2021-10-26T07:42:20Z	(#oesblva) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I know, some people commented on the new look yesterday, so I knew it worked for some. But than you confused me saying that the date shows I've never changed it, which I guess was what this bug was causing.
2021-10-26T09:04:53Z	(#oesblva) @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> Guess the app might be caching them or something, so maybe deleting the cache would help with this. 🤔 Otherwise it'll also have to be presented as a feature "app exclusive avatars" until it gets fixed. 😄 It might be a big here, but Discord is actually charging people $10 a month for the privilege of having a different avatar on some servers, here you get it for free. 😂
2021-10-26T09:06:27Z	(#oesblva) *bug

2021-10-26T12:11:17Z	(#k556qmq) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I also see a hamburger menu in the top left corner when I go to the site, which is nice - I like burgers, but seems a bit pointless as it doesn't do anything when I click it. 🙃
2021-10-26T13:20:19Z	(#k556qmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> They are on most sites, Including you yarn pod, but I don't think moving it to the left is what broke it, unless it's a very fragile burger. 😄
2021-10-26T13:36:51Z	(#k556qmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well on the other hand, I'm the mobile apps, where a thing slides out (including yours) it's almost always on the right, so I wouldn't say the rule is as simple as "always right". 🤔
2021-10-26T16:23:22Z	(#co5hwpq) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt>  Maybe also lists listing the lists of bookmarks. 🤔😂
2021-10-26T17:08:04Z	(#7tmfmpq) @movq No it's not. Stop resisting, you're under arrest Penguin!
2021-10-26T17:40:03Z	(#5jfdpaq) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Interesting, also surprising you're so honest to even show the negative revives of your project on it's main site. Especially those from people who were clearly looking for something else and than found it productive to blame this project for not being that.
2021-10-26T17:44:01Z	(#tclddyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's probably a nice way of saying that they're trying to get rid of the weird and usually old people, using it to argue about politics and George Soros all day, driving everyone with any level of sanity left in them to use another platform.
2021-10-26T17:46:04Z	(#htxyltq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> If you like fancy beers, get yourself some coffee flavored black beer. It's one of the best things I've ever drank, but sadly kinda expensive and hard to get in this country.
2021-10-26T17:51:05Z	(#tclddyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well yes, young people also talk about politics, but most of them use Twitter, Mastodon, Reddit and those kinds of places and aren't as much into weird conspiracy theories, but instead often promote weird political ideologies like anarcho-communism.
2021-10-26T17:53:45Z	(#htxyltq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Any brand you can get, it's hard enough to find any, let alone having the luxury of choosing. 😂 I drank most of it during my internship in Dublin, but the bar there brews it themselves and doesn't export. I was only able to find one Czech brewery making them here, but they don't really export either.
2021-10-26T17:58:30Z	(#htxyltq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt>  I never had that, but I love in Prague and also like Pilsner a lot. But I'm usually cheap, so I'd buy Staropramen instead, it's close enough in taste and costs half the money. Further more, I've seen it exported to other countries and even in Irish supermarkets while I was there, so if you're feeling in the mood for some Czech bear, I'd recommend you look up if they sell it anywhere near you, if you have LIDL, they might have it there. 😄
2021-10-26T20:02:32Z	If any of you remember Charlie the unicorn from the Flash player days of the Internet, the finale just came out: https://youtu.be/IyAC8Hh0atI
2021-10-26T20:31:37Z	(#tclddyq) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> You'd have to ask Facebook. I'm just saying that it seems like they're trying to do some weird things, like back when I was in secondary school a teacher came to us and said that despite him never saying he was a teacher on Facebook, Facebook knew it and was asking him to talk to his students about bullying and now during elections or COVID, they often come out with popups, trying to "disprove missinformatio" or ban the more conspiracy oriented or in general most of the not so advertiser friendly groups. So I guess they were trying to change the course for quite some time already. 🤔
2021-10-26T20:34:46Z	(#5jfdpaq) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Not on product/project pages sadly. Those usually either cherry pick the most positive reviews or say things like "say something positive about our thing and we might put you on the page, linking to your account".
2021-10-26T20:47:48Z	(#co5hwpq) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> This list of list listing list isn't inclusive enough, it has a section for fictional deities, but inugamies (the species of my dog mascot) are excluded, despite having a Wikipedia page, even though that page only talks about the Yokai "version" of an inugami, which probably sharea no similarities with the "modern" inugamies, such as myself. 😏 Yeah, this is the reason why I usually refer to myself as a dog or a canine, to prevent myself from writing inugami related text walls in every post. 😂
2021-10-26T21:42:05Z	(#co5hwpq) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I think it's better I don't, for the sake of everyonesn sanity. The Yokai inugamies who have a page might be a part of mythology, but not really fiction deities (maybe demons). The only "modern" inugami even mentioned on Wikipedia is Sadaharu, the white inugami from the anime Gintama and even he is only mentioned in a list (called "List of Gin Tama characters"). In his description it links to the Yokai inugami page, which is probably because that's the only one that can be written using any "real sources", as the other kinds like the one Gintama used or the one I'm using were changed to fit best with the lore they needed to fit into and honestly even between these two there are some pretty key differences, so Wikipedia is probably better of with just one entry about the Yokai kind (as described in Japanese mythology), rather than also having a long list of every other interpretations that came afterwards and were only used for one or two characters. 😄

2021-10-27T20:48:42Z	(#7ezffiq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I don't think it should be, it's fun to "nothingpost". 🙂
2021-10-27T20:51:59Z	(#7ezffiq) This trick also works on a lot of big platforms, including Discord. 🙂
2021-10-27T20:58:26Z	(#zwipmhq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> We don't use anything from their language anymore. Nor did we since the fall of communism. I just had to learn some basic Russian in the university, so I still have the Russian keyboard installed. 🙃
2021-10-28T16:03:31Z	(#eek7qna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That kinda ruins the fun time travel mystery. 😂 But on a serious note, couldn't they just be cached with the time they get loaded at or something? 🤔
2021-10-28T16:06:23Z	(#skioyiq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> maybe it could be a separate thing, like blogs.twtxt.net that'd just show all the blogs from the users and be it's own thing, but not really actively developed until the time for it comes or something. 🤔
2021-10-28T16:09:32Z	(#eek7qna) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Oh, so we have scheduled posting features now, except the fact they're just kinda accidental, rather than planned. 😄
2021-10-28T16:13:40Z	(#eek7qna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Maybe you could do some kind of a compromise and put them on top of the users profile, but not the timeline visible by everyone, kind of like a timedbpin Tweet, so one could at least somewhat promote future stuff. 🤔
2021-10-28T16:27:28Z	(#skioyiq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Definitely looking forward to that being added, but I'm still not sure if anyone will ever read it, as people usually don't. ~~Maybe you can do it the Twitter way and introduce Yarn +, where you can pay $9.99 and have your future posting features and than split your profit with the doggo who gave you this idea. 😂~~
2021-10-28T16:31:18Z	(#eek7qna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, guess that could be one of the very low priority features, but I don't know how useful it'd be here, as it's mostly used to farm likes and shares by posting in the time where the big accounts following you are active, hoping they see, share and make it blow up. With like/share farming not being possible here, I don't know if I'd ever use it, when I don't even use it on the platforms where both of those things can already be done. 😄
2021-10-28T16:51:37Z	(#b33fcsq) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> one is novaburst wo is in my followers, but only hosts the file on his site, so I don't think he'll talk here. The other person I initially mentioned also hosted the file on his site and seems to no longer even update it.
2021-10-28T17:01:34Z	(#fr6hsja) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> In the app or on the website?
2021-10-28T17:03:15Z	(#fr6hsja) Never mind, I still also see it in both of them, the app just shows it without the profile picture for some reason. 😄
2021-10-28T17:12:23Z	(#ws2uaga) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Yeah, but I don't think he currently uses any kind of a client (web or otherwise), so he'll probably never see your message.
2021-10-28T18:47:45Z	(#cbk2uaq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Good luck, the price of electricity here is going up fast enough, that just this month or so we had 3 electricity suppliers here go bankrupt rather than keep proving it for the prices they agreed on with their customers.
2021-10-28T18:49:57Z	(#iaxmyuq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Most clients don't have the "mark as red" option. I have yet to see it anywhere, so I he'd no idea it even existed, but I guess adding it to more clients could be a solution to his thing. 🤔
2021-10-28T19:00:05Z	(#jnluiga) @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> You better be joking, also good to know that if these are the nanobots, at least they look kinda cool. 😂
2021-10-28T19:13:35Z	(#cbk2uaq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> That's good to hear, I only use public transport as a student, but I thought that electric cars were cool, until people started bringing up battery degradation, but if these rumors are falls and the batteries can last over 10 years, it'd definitely be something worth looking into for future car investments. Also even just as a flex to show people your sites while you're driving around would be so cool. 😂
2021-10-28T19:59:55Z	(#jnluiga) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Probably 😄
2021-10-29T06:03:08Z	(#skioyiq) @laz Making people read your block on it's own address is also almost always way harder to do, which is probably why so many people these days will just make a Twitter thread of something similar to it, rather than trying to link people elsewhere.

2021-10-29T06:55:00Z	(#fb6lbeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Probably, already can't wait for the next release to test the AMOLED theme and clickable profile pic. 😄
2021-10-30T10:15:01Z	(#ftzplka) I like this idea, that it'd be something like "not seen for x days", but it'd definitely have to depend on way more stuff than just logging in. As people using the app or some always running browser might not be logging in and out frequently, but still be active on here. 🤔
2021-10-31T11:33:11Z	Wondering if adding avatars to followers and following would make them more usable and make people use them more often. 🤔
2021-10-31T13:00:56Z	(#6ryyqoq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt>  What I meant was that the app currently only shows you the nicknames in those lists, not the avatar. If you follow or are followed by a lot of people, finding one only based on the nickname probably takes way longer, than what it'd take if those nicknames had avatars next to them.
2021-10-31T13:40:27Z	(#6ryyqoq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I'm not one (at least not yet), but I feel like most of the UI/UX is pretty good, except a few very small things like this, that'll probably get improved overtime.
2021-10-31T19:13:47Z	(#5si3r5a) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Avatars get resized, but I don't think anything else does.

2021-11-04T19:20:41Z	(#hnqobka) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Hey! As someone working with Chromium I can tell you with absolute confidence that there is no way I could ever even make something capable of competing with all the ways the real Chrome spies on you. 😏

2021-11-05T09:58:19Z	(#vwzzy7a) @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> Thanks. And yeah, I was thinking about buying them for quite some time, so I'm happy to have them finally here. Also wondering if I should add them to my profile picture. 😄
2021-11-05T10:21:00Z	(#vwzzy7a) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> Thank you. Also here is the new profile picture with them. I'll try updating it now, so it should soon update for everyone - I guess. 🙂 ![](https://twtxt.net/media/tMQaJtMWergJTqDLthQVQB)
2021-11-05T11:37:06Z	(#vwzzy7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thanks! I hope so. 🙂 it's kinda hard to make something like this into pixelart especially since the glasses themselves change those colors somewhat, based on the lighting and also kinda work as a mirror and the fact one can't fade colors that well, using just a few pixels. 🤔
2021-11-05T11:45:33Z	(#o4jmb5q) @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> I'll definitely look into that. But just as a sidenote Invidous often doesn't load for me correctly, so I usually recommend people switching to HookTube.com instead, for an ad-free viewing that (at least for me) works every time. 🤔
2021-11-05T12:02:57Z	(#o4jmb5q) License wise I also hold that same opinion, that I'm not against any one of these licenses and would rather his she then on case by case basis. But the video is right that in this case the MIT license currently puts most browser developers at the mercy of Google, which is not good, but considering how many of them are just Chrome but slightly different + additional garbage, I wouldn't be too mad if the people who make the browsers like Brave, Opera or Edge and make money doing so actually had to work for that money themselves and maintain their own browser core. It'd also be a great way to finally break Googles monopolization of the Internet and thus benefit us in the long run. 🤔
2021-11-05T12:08:45Z	(#vwzzy7a) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> Thanks! I've probably gotten better than I was at the very beginning, where I only had one drawing of the mascot and just kept changing the clothing and stuff. Now I'm trying to change things as often as I can, but I couldn't resist the urge to add those glasses to the latest one. 🙂
2021-11-05T12:19:45Z	(#vwzzy7a) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Thanks! Mandatory military training isn't a thing here anymore and I'm also not really sure what I want to be and where I want to work. I just know I want to find some good job in IT and that's why I'm studying it since secondary school. 🙂 But than again back in primary school I always wanted to be a teacher, so I guess even this loose job preference idea could still change. 😄
2021-11-05T12:47:57Z	(#vwzzy7a) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> I've never done paid ones, but I should probably consider drawing Tux, next time I'm not in the mood to draw canines. 😄
2021-11-05T13:33:43Z	(#ff6pbqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Also an interesting idea. I made one for Mastodon (of their elephant mascot) when I reached a hundred followers on there. I can probably try the yarn too, it might make for an interesting entery to the "draw something in as few pixels as possible" challenge. 🤔
2021-11-05T14:50:04Z	(#j4kk7ra) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> That's pretty America! 😂 Also the Fairphone seems like a great idea, considering how many phones get thrown away, because the battery gets inflated, the great quality charging port that always gets all wiggly after a year or so of use, the random display cracks that happen and make you find out that for the price of their repair, you can get a whole new phone and all that stuff. If this one will really be this easy to repair, we might finally once again get a phone that doesn't completely fall apart after around 3 years of use.
2021-11-05T17:06:30Z	(#j4kk7ra) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Well I'm an audiophile larper who need a lot of Android exclusive apps (one of them is even needed for all the pixel art I make). So phones without an audio jack (that can't charge and play music through said jack at the same time) are straight up unusable for me and iOS would also be a no-go, with apps that are important for me missing a lack of customization and a company that pretends to care about your privacy, but really doesn't (at least Google is the more honest scumbag). 😂
2021-11-05T18:01:36Z	(#vwzzy7a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Thanks, I've tried making them look the same, but some differences were needed, in order to make them work in the pixelated form. They ended up looking a bit more like skiing glasses, but that's also kinda fitting for the upcoming winter season. 😄
2021-11-05T18:48:37Z	(#vwzzy7a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> No, I don't think there's a single flake of some in this country yet. 😄
2021-11-05T18:51:17Z	(#vwzzy7a) I live in Prague, so even during winter I'd have to take a trip to some mountains to get into skiing. I've done it as a teen by joining skiing camps and stuff, but since than, I've never managed to find the time and people to do that with. 😕
2021-11-05T19:24:13Z	(#j4kk7ra) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Not sure about your claims of "being first", I was a very early adopter of smartphones, on team Android since version 2.2. 😏
2021-11-05T19:34:40Z	(#biyn6tq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> No, but not the kind you can ski on without getting charged for assault.
2021-11-05T20:03:26Z	(#j4kk7ra) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Well I never had any Apple device, just knew people who had. I just always thought they were really overpriced for what they were and way too restrictive, as I've been sideloading apps since that very first Android phone. Removing the headphone jack was just wrong and I've decided I'll never buy any smart device without it (maybe except watches), because it's all done to push wireless headphones and it's bullshit. We all know the jack can fit in there, if they actually cared about what they were making. The fact they added more ports to Macbooks and upgraded to a more professional sound card makes me think that they are starting to realize their mistake and might actually make their phones usable for more people again in the future. 🤔  Also on a side note, fuck the Apple emoji people. I can forgive many things, but your dog is just ugly, to the point where I'm forced to use the fox emoji and whoever made MeMoji a thing should be tried for crimes against the art community as a whole! They're not modern art, they're not even art and I'm forced to see them presented as art in public and I hate all those companies, pushing them down my throat with the passion that words cannot describe.
2021-11-05T20:09:10Z	(#vwzzy7a) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> That's pretty interesting. I don't know if it's something I'd be able to help with drawing, but I'd definitely be interested in checking your custom Tux collection, if it's available somewhere. 🙂
2021-11-05T20:14:32Z	(#x47anoa) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> Bad poetry is the best kind of poetry. Also interested in seeing some tablet drawings in the future. What type of tablet did you get, one with the screen or a screen-less one?
2021-11-05T20:21:19Z	(#vwzzy7a) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I remember seeing this one for sure. 🙂
2021-11-05T20:23:36Z	(#j4kk7ra) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Yeah, now look how much nicer they look on Android: ![](https://twtxt.net/media/WjUViSVifX2NGFY4zhyyyA) You can call me biased, because they chose a shiba, but even that fact aside, I think they just look better.
2021-11-05T20:40:48Z	(#j4kk7ra) Well bias aside, the three dogs in the middle are about the same quality on both systems. I think the second one was also originally somewhat uglier on iOS, but Apple changed it in later versions, so I have to give them some credit for that. I could have also confused it with Twitters version of the second one, but let's not get into that. The first dog emoji and Animoji is just a weird pear shaped abomination and while the last one isn't that bad either, it blends in with the dark backgrounds and German shepherds are obviously better than passable generic black doggo. 🙃
2021-11-06T08:10:36Z	(#j4kk7ra) @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> This 100%! While I liked floppy disks and CD drives back in the day, they simply take too much space to be put in a laptop, so I'll rather take a thinner laptop with no CD drive than a thicker one with it. Also no one really puts stuff on floppys and most CDs with software or games are backed up online. Headphone jack is so tiny and easy to implement, people were able to add it back to their iPhones without making them any bigger, proving Apples was dishonest when arguing that it can no longer fit. Also while there are somewhat usable wireless headphones (for the price of seven or more usable wired ones) they still have a battery that'll go to shit after a few years and they are still worst for music listening according to most (or at best similar) and have a higher latency. I have problems with wired headphones too, as them making the cables nonreplaceable and fragile is just a scummy way to make you have to throw away a perfectly fine pair of headphones that's all good (and that they often won't even service), but the solution to that problem is better wired headphones and not going wireless!
2021-11-06T15:01:13Z	(#mtm2uiq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Shouldn't it be after 14 days (or whatever the period after which the posts get archived is)?
2021-11-06T15:49:14Z	(#poyzfrq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> TL;DS: TikTok is made by a Chinese company specializing in IA and working closely with the Chinese government. They use social engineering to hook up people desperate for attention and keep them using the app, trying to become viral. The TikToks algorithm is made to collect as much user data as possible, form everywhere outside of the app and feeds them to the Chinese government. This data is used to promote a certain way of life depending on the country, like the love for the Chinese government and importance of war in the Chinese version and using thots, degeneracy, missinformation and propaganda to dumb down people in most other countries. During the last few years, Chins was (and still is) preparing for war while the rest of the worlds counties are divided and run by incompetent leaders and inhabited by citizens who'd rather look at thots than fight in WW3.
2021-11-06T16:05:35Z	(#mtm2uiq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Yeah, it'd probably be best if people could swing between those two ways in the settings, if that wouldn't be too hard to implement. One can probably still search for the older stuff, but at that point it'd be pretty inconsistent, listing it as "X days ago" for some of them and by date for the rest.
2021-11-06T19:18:16Z	(#b7o6lqq) @maya Well it's a bit easier, when there's already some daylight by the time you wake up and than you don't have to walk out into freezing temperatures and darkness, but that benefit only lasts a few weeks, before the "day part" of the day shrinks to a point where it's waking up into darkness again. 🙃
2021-11-07T22:10:36Z	Very "educational", also a bit vulgar, so better not played loud at work: https://youtu.be/tpOVDeQ_wwE
2021-11-07T22:22:44Z	(#ut4ww4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's just someone, editing a lot of different Kurzgesagt videos together, to make it say stupid stuff.
2021-11-08T07:37:16Z	(#4iu7x7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, maybe someone should look into what was actually accomplished during all these summits and if they even have some meaning other than "oh, good time was had by all, we'll solve the issue next time". I've heard there was at least one positive things, where a better heating system, taking the heat from earth, rather than using electricity or gas for hearing, was showcased. I've seen these things before, used by people for themselves, but not many can afford the initial cost, even if it pays for itself overtime. If these was a network one could connect to for cheaper and more ecological heating solution, something might actually be accomplished. 🤔
2021-11-08T09:31:56Z	(#5xxtl4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Added some GIF and profile picture suggestions: https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/513 Sorry for the South Park reference. :D
2021-11-08T10:45:15Z	(#5xxtl4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> No problem, I just put five of them on there.
2021-11-08T13:11:33Z	My Spotify playlist maker Spup was just updated to Bootstrap 4.6.1. I started working on it back in secondary school and it is still in development (very slow development, but still), so if you never tried it and want some new playlists in your Spotify, you can get some at: https://spup.glitch.me 😏
2021-11-08T13:13:11Z	(#zvavypq) Or even if you already tried, but than you'd already know the link and wouldn't need this reminder. 😄
2021-11-08T18:57:57Z	(#laka23q) Our favorite mysterious account returns, but this time with no name (at least in my app). 😄
2021-11-08T19:00:14Z	(#knlqsca) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Square profile pictures? Me likee!!! 💯
2021-11-08T19:18:37Z	(#knlqsca) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> I'm a huge fan of square icons, but a big problem for artists is that as long as there is one pod/instance that uses circles, you pretty much have to make your profile picture fit in that circle, if you want those followers to be able to see the whole thing. *This is sadly the case for every platform I use at this point, now even XMPP and the Fediverse, that used to have only circles in the past. Well at least so many square users, one didn't have to worry about fitting in circles.
2021-11-09T07:14:39Z	(#eplfleq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> You mean no one being able to see what peoples others follow or get followed by? Or even hiding those numbers on other peoples profiles?
2021-11-09T07:26:38Z	(#gyqbmea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'd also like people to notice how Zucc and others are pushing so many unnecessary NFT integrations into their VR spyware and in case of Facebook even their own crypto currency. So it might not only be a privacy nightmare, but also some dirty financial scheme, where Facebook sells stuff as NFTs, to convince idiots they are rarer and justify higher prices and when things made by other 3D artists are sold, Facebook gets to take a cut twice. Once through the NFT storefront and once through their crypto shitcoin.
2021-11-09T08:00:41Z	(#gyqbmea) @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> I'd still like to think that it's more the surveillance/bad government part, than the capitalism part. Mostly because the only alternatives to capitalism that people present are either some form of communism or some anarchist system and both of those sound even less appealing to me.
2021-11-09T22:36:47Z	(#iowdgmq) @sorenpeter3 What kind of a strange dimensions have you gotten yourself into?
2021-11-10T07:04:16Z	(#hfal6kq) I think that it'd be better to remove it (it doesn't work well enough to justify it being a thing), but I 100% agree that there should be a preview thing, to let users check that their pictures, links and markup work correctly (especially since the markup buttons in app still don't always do what they should) and just see it in this new way, so they can read it again in this new way and have one last chance to notice the typos. *This should be a button, not something that has to happen before every post is sent - obviously.
2021-11-10T07:05:28Z	(#xoo2viq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What do you mean by custom pages?
2021-11-10T13:26:36Z	(#hfal6kq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Guess that would work the best, but the time would have to be pretty short and it would probably be harder to implement, than the other solutions. 🤔
2021-11-10T19:00:18Z	(#hfal6kq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yeah, now that you phrase it like this, the deletion should not be removed, but rather improved. It'd probably be better to get rid of editing (for all the problems it causes) and just focus on making the deletion of posts work better, rather than removing it both of those things.
2021-11-10T19:43:24Z	(#hfal6kq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sounds like a good place to start at, but I still can't really imagine how will any of this syncing look when it's finished and how understandable will it be for new users. 🤔
2021-11-11T12:26:20Z	(#qblbnna) @<adi https://f.adi.onl/user/adi/twtxt.txt> It would be nice indeed. Now thanks to the power of the card, YOU shall now send 10€ to ME! 😏 ![](https://twtxt.net/media/2siCVfJVZzk4m7Gu5u2BBZ)
2021-11-11T21:47:32Z	When you were talking about renaming the app a few weeks ago, did you also meant changing the icon? If yes, is there some new icon design to see out there somewhere?
2021-11-11T21:56:29Z	(#7evtnvq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I really like the clean design of the one used on top of the twtxt.net site and think that should probably be the logo. Also could someone link me that image file, so I could check it out please? I'm currently on the phone, so I can't download it from there myself.
2021-11-11T23:26:41Z	(#d2uw2na) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The markup for the app probably shouldn't be too hard to fix. 🤔
2021-11-11T23:29:33Z	(#d2uw2na) The renaming might also not be too hard, since I was able to change it for fun, when just messing with the app in App Clonner. 😄 ![](https://twtxt.net/media/JBKkRFC4L4xxAgunVbf3XR)
2021-11-11T23:34:32Z	(#d2uw2na) I wasn't able to do much else with it sadly, other than add the option to add a tile shortcut to the Android pill down thing that has the WiFi, Bluetooth and all the other tiles in it. I can't even screenshot that, because Android. 🙃
2021-11-12T12:02:53Z	(#7evtnvq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Here is one from me to add to that collection. 🙂 ![](https://twtxt.net/media/Kak2Msg4DUTnKP3hz5dCoE)
2021-11-12T13:02:29Z	(#d2uw2na) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I think the mobile app is as important as the web, but these small things in the web version are indeed a little annoying and on most social media, people are used to the fact it'll automatically refresh and keep up to date, when you are at the very top of the page, or have it running on the background like that. 🤔
2021-11-12T13:18:48Z	(#d2uw2na) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well this and what I said, but I don't know if you can call it SPA. I don't understand your weird abbreviations. 🤨
2021-11-12T13:21:49Z	(#d2uw2na) Well and fixing the damn app markup, or telling me what file it's in, so I can have a look at it myself, even though I'm not sure I'd see anything there, without the program you're using to write the app.
2021-11-12T13:24:26Z	(#v2ltcda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Most likely because you're not a ball of yarn, unlike me who is actually a doggo. 😏 **Ignore the photo I posted a week ago!**
2021-11-12T13:28:20Z	(#d2uw2na) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> *screams violently* You have to be doing it on purpose at this point. I had to have brought it up on a million separate occasions at his point. The *I* and **B** in the app both do bold text and there is two spaces after the nickname, when you're replying to people!
2021-11-12T13:32:58Z	(#d2uw2na) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well do you remember what file these things would be in, so I could see if I'd be able to help with it?
2021-11-12T13:48:42Z	(#d2uw2na) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, the code now looks like it should work exactly the same as in the web version, but I still can't find which part of it causes the extra space. 🤔

2021-11-12T17:30:13Z	(#nc4lm4q) Looks like you can't spam a long empty post, but still wondering if there is some character limit or line limit in place here. I don't want to test it though as it'd make this place quite unusable, so I guess it's just better if I ask. 🙃
2021-11-12T19:39:30Z	(#nc4lm4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I didn't know there is one. Also don't know if I would be of any help, other than my skills in spamming. 😏 Might just be better to set a maximum number of lines and letters of it isn't already, or shorten the posts with too many lines and add a "more" button at the end. 🤔
2021-11-12T19:49:25Z	(#nc4lm4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well be thankful I went with the star test, I could have posted an entire book or something to test this out. Still wondering what that'd do, but I don't want to get knocked from here. 😄

2021-11-12T21:27:35Z	(#jebvweq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I don't know what it is either, but I'm sure I've seen it growing here before. 🙂
2021-11-13T06:45:15Z	(#s5x3jra) I was just joking, I still hate NFTs, or at the very least think that so far they've only been implemented poorly. Attaching them to "art" is misleading at best and aiding money laundering/ tax evasion at worse. Not to mention the environment damages it costs on top of all that.  But than again, in all honesty, I'd still be able to look past all that, if it didn't further ruin the already ruined state of the "art world", where you can now just take someones hard work, that they made for free or for very little money and just sell it as an NFT without them being able to do anything about it or even ever knowing. Or sell stock images that people buy, because it got promoted by some "celebrity" desperate for money to buy crack. Not to mention OpenSee being one of the scummyest companies out there, exposed for their employees knowing what would get featured on the front page next and some abusing it to get ridiculously rich, using this insider knowledge.
2021-11-13T23:18:22Z	(#a7rzvtq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Maybe I'll join the invasion, that pool looks pretty great too. 🙃
2021-11-13T23:24:42Z	(#73egvrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Maybe someone can make a board game not for Yarn, where people reply with game commands and the bot would reply with the updated game board. 🤔 But than again, that'd probably need to be it's own pod, due to how much spam it would no doubt produce. 🤨
2021-11-14T18:01:01Z	(#6ksvjba) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I don't think that's a good idea in any way! Timeline is for those who you follow and Discover is for finding new users. Without Discover, you wouldn't be able to find anyone to talk to when joining a pod and without the Timeline, pods wouldn't really be scalable without eventually becoming an absolute mess. 😨
2021-11-15T13:35:54Z	(#dxrauaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ah yes, the hotfix hotfix hotfix hotfix. It really do be like that sometimes. 🙃
2021-11-15T13:51:44Z	(#zo55cua) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> Hopefully we'll also soon see some of these new features in the app. 🤞
2021-11-15T15:03:32Z	(#2nzopvq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt>  The roadmap: 1. Make Yarn.Social 2. Hotfix 3. Hotfix hotfix 4. ... ∞. Ethical profit?  (Sorry, with how many hotfixes my projects require, I'm really not in a position, where I should be making these jokes.)
2021-11-15T19:55:47Z	(#j43fuia) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Yeah, using the app, I didn't even notice that. 🙃
2021-11-15T22:30:15Z	(#x5mgjyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, the separation of apps rarely ends well, especially when it comes to smaller projects.
2021-11-15T22:46:44Z	(#x5mgjyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Idk, I'm not that big of a progressive web-app enthusiast, but I guess that's the unavoidable future we'll have to live in, where everything is just some form of Chromium and we all live in a pod, eat bugs and draw the flat ugly smiling illustrations that appear in Gmail, to please put corporate overlords to mock us with. 🤨
2021-11-15T22:57:49Z	(#x5mgjyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Oh yeah, maybe I was confusing it with the Electron apps or the kind of browser apps, that just open the site either in the browser itself or some wrapper that's 99% of the time based on Chromium. 🤔
2021-11-15T23:08:02Z	(#x5mgjyq) Well, now I'm thinking about it and it is the apps that are opening in the browser, that to be fair doesn't have to be Chromium based, just new and most of those use Chromium. I guess it can also be compiled as an app in some better way than what I just described, but I don't really have experience with that, so I won't judge that until I see more of it. 🤔
2021-11-16T06:40:30Z	(#pj7kioa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Strange you defend Apple than, when: -Can't even repair their shit without half of it breaking by software. -Good luck trying to install another OS on any of it, now when it's all using M1. -No side-loading apps that Timmy doesn't like. Literally can't even choose a browser that's not using the basic WebKit on your phone. 😂
2021-11-16T07:18:56Z	(#pj7kioa) @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't know much about that sadly, I thought Android improved in that area, but it looks like by default it still only has that shitty TalkBack thing and that's about it, unless you find and install other things yourself. I don't even know how these things work on Apple, so I guess it's hard to compare when I don't know the other side, guess that Microsoft at least tried to somewhat improve it in Windows 10 and newer (at least according to this: https://www.google.com/amp/s/helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/windows-10-accessibility-features-for-disabled-people/amp/ ), but if you want to get as close to pure Linux, you're probably not looking into switching to Windows. With Linux there is so many distributions, that I'd be surprised if none of them had a good implementation, but I haven't really looked into that at any point, so I really don't know.
2021-11-16T07:26:04Z	(#pj7kioa) Also to be fair to Android, I just checked and it looks like they added at least some other stuff similar to the stuff mentioned in that article about Windows, but I'm using EMUI, rather than the pure Android and this it is probably not only based on the Android version, but also on how much the manufacturer cares about making these things work in their modification of Android. 🤔
2021-11-16T07:50:14Z	(#pj7kioa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I can imagine that being pretty neat for all kinds of stuff and with my current phone barely holding together at this point, I'm looking into buying a new one and seeing as Androids these days also improved their displays a lot, I guess I'll be able to find out if I'll enjoy the 120hz amoled to the point of no return or if I still think increasing the hz number past 80hz or so is an overkill. 🤔
2021-11-16T09:08:39Z	(#nzmpuzq) @<magnus https://twtxt.net/user/magnus/twtxt.txt> If you click the text field, it should appear again. But the app has some problems with selecting more words and sometimes the copy/paste thing doesn't appear either, which is a known issue.
2021-11-16T12:43:56Z	I'm wondering if one could somehow run a pod through the free Heroku hosting thing. I'm wondering so much that I'll probably give it a try and than report back from said pod if it really ends up working by any chance. 😏
2021-11-16T12:46:41Z	(#xckih5q) "Push rejected, failed to compile Go app." I guess no free pod hosting today. 😟
2021-11-16T13:09:01Z	(#swx5eua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Bit of a shame one probably needs their own pod to play with themes. 😄
2021-11-16T13:19:21Z	(#swx5eua) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Well my machine is a thin laptop with limited memory, that I don't always have turned on and even if I did, the quality of the Internet here and all the need to use he machine for other things, have it off or bring it somewhere would make it at best run like 6/24 and even than someone would probably tell me to not waste electricity on it. 😄
2021-11-16T13:26:20Z	(#xckih5q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't know to be honest, I never ran anything on it before. I usually use Glitch.com to run my web apps. I wanted to try starting a pod there, but Glitch currently has to hibernate apps that aren't being used, at least unless you pay them to keep it up 24/7 so I thought that would make it not very usable for pod hosting, even if it by some miracle supported Go, which it probably doesn't. 🤔
2021-11-16T13:31:44Z	(#swx5eua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Raspberry Pie > Weird free hosting sites
2021-11-16T13:43:25Z	(#swx5eua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Guess that's as cheap as one can get, Glitch can't run Go either anyway and I think their always online plan is also more expensive than this. 🤔
2021-11-16T14:21:48Z	(#swx5eua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I guess that might be true, but there still is something in there that the free hosting sites don't like so it throws out some error that made me think it had something to do with Go. 🤔
2021-11-16T14:23:29Z	(#swx5eua) Especially when it was literally "Pusher rejected, failed to compile Go app. " in one case and so error getting some file.go thing in the other case. 🤨
2021-11-16T14:49:37Z	(#4tb3nha) @movq Aww, now I'm sad I never made an npm module, back in my more JS focused days. 🙃

2021-11-16T18:01:46Z	Any good site where one can throw a video in to post it here? I know @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> had one, but I forgot the URL of that.
2021-11-16T18:20:12Z	(#jv3jb2a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Oi there! Have you got a license for that fork?
2021-11-16T19:26:37Z	(#qhg7ckq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> That had to cost even more than the Tesla - probably. Either way, you must be pretty rich, driving these kinds of cars. I don't even have a driving license. 🥴
2021-11-16T19:41:40Z	(#vhktvfa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Doesn't seem to work anymore. Maybe the video is just weird -idk. 🤔
2021-11-16T19:45:25Z	(#qhg7ckq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Well the Tesla is over a million in our worthless currency, but than again that's not anything too out of the ordinary, with how much cars cost these days. The real question is, did they finally make the browser it come with any good? 🤔😏
2021-11-16T19:56:47Z	(#xskayra) @movq Find that kinda strange too, since here those rules are completely different. Here the normal plates have to have 7 random characters and the vanity ones 8 and that can never be changed. One of them also has to be a number in both cases. But than on the other hand I don't think they can deny your request, as long as it's unique and meets these requirements.
2021-11-16T19:59:05Z	(#qhg7ckq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Guess that's good enough to commit the crime of Yarn and driving. _badumts_ 😉
2021-11-16T20:25:30Z	(#xskayra) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I guess it's also kinda fun, having a restriction one has to work around to deserve their plate. I was always wondering if people would get "AMCAN1NE" or if it would be better to have something like "0CANINE0", especially since people here don't speak English, but sadly we don't have a word for canine in this language, it's like a two word phrase that'd be way too long an not as nice sounding. 🤔 But I'm pretty sure even you US people probably have some minimum and maximum number of characters for them, like I doubt something short like "K9" or some long drawn out nickname like "yearofthecanine" or "caninesalwayswin" would be allowed. Also the second one of those would probably also be too arrogant to put on a car. 😂
2021-11-16T20:27:18Z	(#n7hz2dq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> _achooooo!_
2021-11-16T20:45:36Z	(#lqbwhrq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> That or the yellow text on black, if that's still a thing. That'd be matching with my website and I usually like simple designs. Also bet "K9" is already taken. 😄
2021-11-16T20:58:00Z	(#lqbwhrq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Yeah, but you'd probably have to drive to that state to register it. Don't know if that'd be worth it, especially if it'd be one on the opposite side of the country. 😂
2021-11-16T21:25:02Z	No problem @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>, time for some Yarn exclusive, high quality abstract art! ![](https://twtxt.net/media/tgtp9ydfPkxFfFBLmdiXgX) I call this piece "the junk I found in my bedroom". You can get an NFT of it for mere $474947.
2021-11-16T21:52:33Z	(#7g6w7lq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> It's both art and a reminder to clean up, which is where the deep meaning behind the piece lies. 😉
2021-11-17T07:19:42Z	(#34rgeia) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> The version I was referring to is currently hosted on two sites: https://flist.glitch.me and  https://canines.42web.io
2021-11-17T07:27:14Z	(#vhktvfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Honestly don't know, it gave me like a 3 pages long red block of error text and all I remember is that it mentioned something about thumbnails. 🤔
2021-11-17T08:11:01Z	(#7g6w7lq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> If you want my my bedroom hunt that much,for that price I could probably also mail it to you (except that card game, that isn't even mine). But I thought not having to own an empty paprika flavored LIDL chips container, two boxes of tissues (one empty) the cheapest piece of plastic stand thing imaginable and a bootleg Amogus plushie for a quarter of a dollar that was a keychain before falling apart on day 1 was one of this pieces many advantages. 😂
2021-11-17T08:14:11Z	(#7g6w7lq) ~~hunt~~ junk
2021-11-17T08:16:00Z	(#7g6w7lq) but I guess "Bedroom Hunt" could be the name of that masterpiece. After all, every piece of high art needs an abstract name to sell well. 😏

2021-11-17T12:14:33Z	(#vhktvfa) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I was thinking about that, but most paste sites are not that great and while it is really long for an error message, it's not something impossible to scroll past.
2021-11-17T12:40:52Z	(#vhktvfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> You should make some list of all your services and link it in the bio of your profile for people with bad memory (such as myself) to find. 🙂
2021-11-17T12:43:30Z	(#vhktvfa) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I'm not British mate, me don't say blody in every sentence - do I luv. 😏 Also I don't really like GitHub myself, or GitHut, which I guess would at least be a nice name for a pizza place.
2021-11-17T12:47:47Z	(#vhktvfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I tested it with the funny video of the Twitter guy having an existential crisis over penguin NFTs. The error is probably caused by it being one of those stupidly high videos, filmed vertically on a phone. Either way I'd recommend you all use it for testing stuff or just watch it here, I laugh while watching it every time: https://youtu.be/gIKhHXXJEIk
2021-11-17T13:08:41Z	(#vhktvfa) @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> Yeah, that's just crazy! Is there something you don't host yet? Also feels kinda weird, having the option to look around someones PLEX server. 😄
2021-11-17T18:34:30Z	Looks like we now have our own dedicated bootleg ad domain at https://twtx.net 🥴
2021-11-17T18:38:32Z	Also still can't find my other me at @exiledcanine I guess since no one from here is following that account yet, it doesn't even show up in the Discover tab. 🙃
2021-11-17T18:47:23Z	(#xjnlgyq) Guess I don't need it anyway, so I might as well delete it and go back to just using this one. I don't really like having alt-accounts anyway. But I brought this server back alive by creating it. It's like when you forget the umbrella it rains, but when you don't it doesn't, so of course the og server came back up the second I made an alt-account elsewhere. 😂
2021-11-17T18:48:32Z	(#a4gevbq) @ullarah radio.garden is interesting, if you want to explore stations from all around the world.
2021-11-17T19:20:54Z	(#oqu4opa) Sorry for that confusion, normal Czech people write exactly like you described. I just sometimes do that weird thing where I go on forever without ending the sentence, dividing it into parts using just ","s. Than, because I feel like I'm starting a new separate block of text by that new sentence, I sometimes make it new line, because I assume that makes it easier to read. The key points is that it's not what most people do, it's just a unique thing to me and the stupid text formatting that works best for me, while microblogging online. 😄
2021-11-17T20:51:11Z	(#vhktvfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't know how to describe it. I'm not a PLEX user myself, but it doesn't even look like it's showing your collections, just some Live TV, that stupid thing promoting Tidal and some old movies that it claims are there provided by PLEX, if you let them play ads while you're watching them. 🤔
2021-11-17T21:15:25Z	(#wweplua) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, it's just one of those sites with a similar domain, hoping you'll game a mistake spelling the real one and than they try to spam ads at you to make more than the domain costs them. It's kinda like a badge of honor amongst programmers, that someone though your project had enough of a potential for them to buy these kinds of domains and try to profit of of it's users spelling mistakes. 😄
2021-11-17T21:46:10Z	(#xnotlmq) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Funny enough the app doesn't let you unfollow profiles that it can't load, so I'll have to go do that in the browser. 🥴
2021-11-18T07:39:48Z	(#zqt2f5a) @fastidious It is a step in the right direction, I'm not arguing against that, but it won't make me much less skeptical, when it's coming from a company that spent years trying do fight for the exact opposite thing, making official parts hard to get, the phones very difficult to repair and unofficial services unable to even properly "calibrate" the parts together.
2021-11-18T07:51:37Z	(#meoufpq) @fastidious I don't think that's a good idea. It'd make keeping up with replies almost impossible. At best I can see it working if there was a Twitter like switch between show replies and hide replies on these pages, but even than I'm not really sure if that wouldn't negativity effect the conversation. 🤔
2021-11-18T08:02:10Z	(#okvr5aa) @xuu Yeah, the mirror would probably be the best idea.
2021-11-18T10:15:07Z	(#xnotlmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, it might also be the fact that Flutter itself has some problems in itself. While trying to look into the problems with keyboards and text selections, I just discovered this, which might be interesting to look into during the future app development: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/26563 🤔
2021-11-18T13:30:12Z	(#meoufpq) @fastidious Yeah, I'm following you but the mentions are now somewhat broken. I'm not refusing to use the site, I use the site pretty often as well, I just sometimes use the mobile app, because that's easier for me to use when I'm on mobile and don't already happen to be using the browser on it. 🙃
2021-11-18T13:34:51Z	(#r2w2lwa) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> ah, it happened again, it also didn't let me unfollow you from the app, than I tried from the web and it was saying something like "no feed by the name fastidious", but now I was able to unfollow and follow again so hopefully I can now mention you without problems. 🤞
2021-11-18T13:36:01Z	(#meoufpq) @fastidious One last test to see if I can now mention you from the mobile app.
2021-11-18T13:36:39Z	(#meoufpq) No, looks like that's still boken, but at least it works from the web. 🥴
2021-11-18T13:38:19Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> looks like mentioning people from a different pod sometimes doesn't work using the app either, because it never mentions them the proper way that would also include the domain. 🤔
2021-11-19T11:45:14Z	(#ehh2rpq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I just made that. 🙂
2021-11-19T12:01:33Z	(#oe4juqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, the screenshot seems like an improvement, but I wouldn't put it under the name and picture, but rather to the right of them. Keeping a long distance between the profile and the button on the right like most platforms do.
2021-11-19T12:08:33Z	(#oe4juqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ![](https://files.mills.io/download/3ZPH7aQXrxkJZ2vhttc6qA.png) I would do something like this...
2021-11-20T21:05:01Z	(#m5akmoa) @<ionores https://twtxt.net/user/ionores/twtxt.txt> I try to do both. My desk is not too bad and I could open a few beers that way, but people warned me that it'd destroy my teeth, so I learned to open them by smashing the over-hanging part of the cap against a bench or something similar, which is also consider to be a cool way by most and isn't mouth destructing. 🙃
2021-11-20T21:23:23Z	(#m5akmoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That's the normie way and if you're drinking outside in a park (legal here), you're usually not carrying one with you at that point anyway. 🤨
2021-11-20T22:01:47Z	(#m5akmoa) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> That doesn't seem to make much sense honestly. How does putting it into a paper bag make it that much better??! 🥴 On the other hand here we also have some reasonable restrictions, like the fact that parks can decide to prohibit it too, so if it's a park where children are playing it'll usually be prohibited there, but some of those open parks have no problem with it, some even have allow businesses to set up an alcohol stand or rent a place there to serve take-away food and drinks (alcohol included).
2021-11-21T13:04:39Z	(#q7jiqqq) @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> My thoughts exactly. The NFT archiver said he's trying to preserve them for the future generations, to see our generations equivalent of the Tulipmania. He's the man the art community needs, but not the one we deserve.
2021-11-21T13:24:56Z	(#p27boja) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I know Twitter is just shit, I hate it for all these and many other reasons, but even I think saying that you need an account to read it is a bit dishonest. 🤔
2021-11-21T13:29:20Z	(#q5v7x7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think it's meant for bugs in general, but it's true that most of them seem to prefer real trees anyway.
2021-11-21T13:36:51Z	Can pictures with transparent background be used as profile pictures? 🤔
2021-11-21T16:01:00Z	Testing this new idea for a profile picture. 😄 Also a test of Yarns ability to support profile pictures with transparent background, but it looks like it just replaces the transparent parts with black color. 🤔 ![](https://twtxt.net/media/ouKCFnApvueGkZGJffJMpX)
2021-11-21T16:04:02Z	(#uiaashq) Nevermind, it works really well on the web version. The black background is just in the app. 🙃
2021-11-21T21:25:39Z	(#uiaashq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Glad you like it! 😄
2021-11-22T17:46:56Z	NFT bros: Look, our crypto NFT is so decentralized, we're escaping the evil banks, dictating who can accept money and who's too controversial. NFT bros a day later: Nooooo OpenSea, you can't just take this offensive monkey away from me, I sold my house to buy it and now it's gone - noooooooooooooo!
2021-11-22T17:52:31Z	(#uiaashq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Thank you!
2021-11-23T09:02:19Z	(#eyhxhoq) @xuu They're ascending to the icon heaven! 🙏
2021-11-26T17:11:58Z	(#p4y25la) @ullarah I like it. 👍
2021-11-26T21:29:03Z	(#thttegq) @xandkar Good to see myself on the verified list. Where can I claim my verification badge? 😄
2021-11-26T22:39:12Z	(#yrzk2fa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Thank you, it's great! It's a shame I can't pin it on my profile or something. 🙃
2021-11-27T19:07:34Z	(#yrzk2fa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yeah ~~and so do the nicknames,cause that's where the real fun begins~~. 🙃
2021-11-28T10:58:48Z	(#edbsgeq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> It was a joke referencing the Fediverse trend of using custom emojis (emojos) in nicknames.
2021-11-28T11:02:57Z	My fancy OpenNIC domain http://dogg.oss is now functional, so if you have a DNS that supports it, you can give it a try. But sadly most DNS servers don't, so I doubt many people will be able to use it. 🙃
2021-11-28T11:32:02Z	(#u6n4yka) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's an alternative domain register, where anyone can start their top level domain for free (if they have what it takes) and also freely offer it to others. So I grabbed one. You can go to https://www.opennic.org/ to find out more or get the fastest DNS server for their resolving in your area. 😉
2021-11-28T11:46:52Z	(#u6n4yka) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It is new, the domain has been registered for about a month now and left the testing phase yesterday, when the records were updated to the correct site, so it might take some time to get to the other servers. But it already WorksForMe TM. And yes, you should absolutely start your own, because I think that if you run it for some time you get the right to claim your own too level, so you could make ".yarn" a thing, or something else that you'd like.
2021-11-28T11:48:27Z	(#edbsgeq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I do. I enjoy confusing people with write emojis that look like official badges to make them think I'm some kind of a bread inspector or something. 😂
2021-11-28T12:05:51Z	(#yj4so4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> There are also some issues with these domains relying on the browsers to automatically put "www." in front of them, so in some browsers you may need to put it http://www.dogg.oss to get it working. 🤔
2021-11-28T12:36:08Z	(#yj4so4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, there are still all kinds of problems trying to make these domains work, because most of the Internet just isn't made to work with alternative domains. It doesn't work with some browsers at all and https seems to break it too. Using only http breaks some of the fonts on the site, but that may at least make it easier to read, so it's something I can live with.
2021-11-28T13:04:11Z	(#yj4so4q) @fastidious Not really, this is a network that already includes more similar minded DNS projects resolving each others domains and I really believe that there needs to be an alternative for everything and find the idea of alternative domain solutions very interesting. 🤔
2021-11-28T14:51:08Z	(#yj4so4q) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Yeah right! We're going to make our own network of DNS servers with blackjack and hookers! 😏
2021-11-29T21:15:52Z	(#mdr3eeq) @<ionores https://twtxt.net/user/ionores/twtxt.txt> Guess he can always be a crypto shill, he already has enough experience with that, with pumping Bitcoin and selling his first ever Tweet A's an NFT for a completely unreasonable amount of money.
2021-11-29T21:36:21Z	(#mdr3eeq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Looks like he stepped donw. I never liked the guy, but I think he didn't have that much to do with how the company "worked" anyway, so I doubt it'll get much better with some other idiot in charge of it and the current idiot was at least unintentionally funny.
2021-11-29T21:43:44Z	(#zynf6rq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> There's a Zoom link already posted in this Yarn, so I don't see why it wouldn't. 🙂
2021-12-01T16:02:45Z	(#hhbovzq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't know if we're on the same page, but this new Twitter rule seems kinda abusable. What if you're recording something news-worthy, like crimes, fights, natural disasters with people in the video? Don't the laws you mention only apply to places with reasonable explanations of privacy? How are you supposed to take pictures of literally anything someone is standing next to? And many more questions that just keep coming to my mind.
2021-12-01T16:08:57Z	(#75wlltq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I can't code everyday, can't even draw everyday either, especially during these busy, exam-filled days. But I enjoy the YouTube channels Ashens and MrWeeble usually having advent calendar-ish video projects and the site chip.de having an advent calendar with free software, but there is rarely any good software in there. 🙃
2021-12-01T16:11:30Z	(#pycm5vq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah it's crazy how fast Microsoft returned to the old IE days filled with abusing their good position in the browser space. 😒
2021-12-01T16:23:07Z	(#xbn6g5q) @<deebs https://twtxt.net/user/deebs/twtxt.txt> Yeah, it's a story as old as time, I remember when I joined KeyBase. It had private messages, place to link and verify your social media and keys, later they also added some weird crypto integration and than it got bought by some Chinese company and the privacy went right out the window. So I don't really trust these new services asking for a phone numbers and offering weird crypto integrations that no one ever asked for. I gave Signal a try and didn't really like it. Telegram was a tiny bit better, but still think it's not even work to keep it installed on my phone.
2021-12-01T16:28:30Z	(#xbn6g5q) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> 😂 Not really. I'm an ideal world the standard for safe messaging would be open and universal, with no potential for backdoors. In this idea world Apple and similar companies would have already went bankrupt, over the shit they tend to push. 😂
2021-12-01T16:33:02Z	(#75wlltq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Me when I find myself crossing an international border, close to midnight, using free bus WiFi, spammed by messages from people, telling me that the server hosting my web-apps is down. 😂 *Only happened once so far
2021-12-01T16:59:41Z	(#xbn6g5q) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Ah, so it is better when Google and Apple have two incompatible standards for this kind of messaging and some other companies using Android use neither and thus most messages are just basic, ancient and un-encrypted SMS? Or are you a backdoor enjoyer?
2021-12-01T18:16:39Z	(#xbn6g5q) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I agree with the first part, hopefully it indeed becomes more widely uaed.  I don't use Signal, when I want privacy I use XMPP, at best with OMEMO encryption in DMs. But that's obviously not something I'm able to use talking to most people, so at times I have to use the garage like Facebook Messenger, MS Teams or Discord.  With Discord I still kinda like a lot of things about it and wouldn't even call it garbage, if the company wasn't so money hungry.  Speaking of garbage, this is the third time I'm writing this reply, it keeps logging me out when I try sending it, if it happens again, I'll stab someone. 🔪
2021-12-01T21:23:04Z	(#pdogumq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I just thought it was trying to be too many things at once, I don't want a new crypto currency thing, I don't want another SMS and calling app, when I already got Truecaller to block annoying people from calling me. They also preach open-source and yet parts of the app have been close-sourced already.  Still none of this would have been that much of a problem, if the whole thing just wasn't too little, too late. When I tried it, only one person I know was willing to give it a chance, as it's not that revolutionary and most people already got burned by apps like Keybase in the past, so at this point the solution isn't another app that will probably be bought by someone and go to shit like all the ones before it, but rather a protocol like XMPP, which has many clients and can't just he bought and abused.
2021-12-01T21:31:17Z	(#hmtxdza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> At least when the mobile app does it, it happens rarely and only when the app gets closed. Today it happened on the website itself, two times in the row, when I was sending a response while in the Yarn.  I don't know if it would have happened a third time, because after doing it twice, I just sent it from the app.
2021-12-01T21:40:17Z	(#pdogumq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> This is the colse-sourced part: https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/qlw1ag/signal_is_adding_a_closedsource_spam_reduction/ So far it's only a spam filter, but it's still code running on the server that no one can look at, so counts in my book.  Also I guess my arguments about the protocol and crypto aren't the strongest, but the truth is that I just don't like the fact that it's just another similar protocol and similar crypto that I want to have absolutely nothing to do with.  It's the same as brave browser, I'd never download it, because I want a browser, not adware, crypto-wallet, torrent client and other garbage I do not like.
2021-12-02T11:55:25Z	(#httoida) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Don't know if that is necessarily expected when forking. I usually just get the hash (with no nickname) when forking from the app, so with forking the thing you get might be more of a lottery. 😂
2021-12-02T15:39:09Z	(#xnggzqa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Good to see another canine be a part of the team, but sdly I don’t see a "Follow" button on their page. :(
2021-12-02T15:42:32Z	(#httoida) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Guess this is another thing that needs to be updated in the app along with the cross-pod mentions and doublespaces.
2021-12-02T22:28:43Z	(#xnggzqa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I see it in the app just fine. This was in browser at university with light theme on, but I guess I could have just had a brain shortcut and not notice it. 🤔
2021-12-03T08:33:35Z	(#ofd4vhq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> If I was you I'd be more concerned about the Australian governments idiotic views on social media that everyone keeps making fun off: https://youtu.be/Q87qmE0WtIs It's times like these, when I'm happy I at least don't live in one of the countries already in he dystopian future era, where the government can just cease your account and post anything they want on it in your name.
2021-12-03T09:57:20Z	(#t4j6gyq) @ullarah To be fair, if I read the site correctly, that money gets you the both the first and the second Mordor game. That's not so bad, if you can find a way to still run them on your PC. 🙃
2021-12-04T10:41:15Z	The https://tube.mills.io site is kinda falling apart @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> , video importing returns 502, I tried uploading something else and when the uploading finished, I got another 502, tried again and than I see it there twice. I opened up an issue about the importing, but might still need you to delete the newer upload (with the nonse name). ![](https://tube.mills.io/v/DS8TJTXkjb7Y8ZQpuVnwLZ?sort=) And here is the working upload, to see if I can finally get videos to work here. 🙃
2021-12-04T11:29:13Z	(#osc23qa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> If you start one, I might be able to join it a bit later. 🤔
2021-12-04T17:35:52Z	(#ltytllq) Well my original nickname (different from my actual first name) was "cikarin3" - reference to the čikarí squirrel and my favorite number, back than I joined the community around Dishonored Wolf, so I started using a pixelated wolf as my avatar, that later evolved into the current shiba-looking inugami mascot and was using all kinds of canine related nicknames, or just the word canine/dog in different languages, so it eventually just stuck to me and I became "The Canine".  There are also other two not that used canine related nicknames CAW (short for "Canines Always Win") and YOTC (short for "Year Of The Canine" and a reference to the other fancy sunglasses emotes, that are usually called "Year Of The...thing") and as I said many other canine related jokes. 🙃
2021-12-05T08:55:24Z	(#e5dka5a) The real challenge would be to do them all in visual basic and not hang yourself during the first week. 😂
2021-12-05T10:12:20Z	(#e5dka5a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Maybe I'm somewhat biased, because I had to use the bullshit implementation in Microsoft Excel, but I can't imagine the real thing being much better. 🤔
2021-12-05T10:14:43Z	(#5dzebga) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> That looks amazing! From the 25th of December, you'll be required to join every online Yarn meeting and start it with a guitar song! 😏
2021-12-05T12:59:35Z	(#txo4aoq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> It looks pretty similar to a overcomplicated crypto-scam, which is probably what it is. I don't have much faith in anything anymore, but I doubt the Internet is just going to degrade into it all being this. 🤨
2021-12-06T09:53:15Z	(#k36x2za) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> 5 versions behind, but damn, there is something about that color scheme and square profile pictures with rounded edges, no outline and that theme in general, that just makes it look great! 👏
2021-12-06T10:05:10Z	(#jkgumvq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well shitty tech start-ups, with the name of some shitty celebrity attached, always make a shit ton of money - before failing, most of the times.  As for the moderation, during the day or so long test run disaster, people critical of the site or those involved already got the ban hammer and the ToS prohibit quite a bit of speech too.
2021-12-06T10:17:48Z	(#c3segvq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Nor can you trick those dumb investors, to sink this kind of money into a Yarn pod, as there is no opportunity to mine money back out of it and despite what these people preach, none of them are really in favor of decentralization, because people in different pods, might have a different opinion and we can't have that on a "censorship fighting" platform, can we?
2021-12-06T10:24:42Z	(#c3segvq) @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> Well he has an unofficial account on Gab, that he posts on through some other service and he bought one of the right-leaning YouTube alternatives, changing it's ToS afterwards, to allow less "free speech".  I think he doesn't want to do the same with Gab, because of Gabs bad reputation and many technical problems, thanks to it's insane founder (who probably wouldn't even sell it). Funny enough, his thing seems to have even more problems than Gab, so far.
2021-12-06T10:29:31Z	(#6ctnhwa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It was not on a codebase level. Some Mastodon/Fediverse instances still federated with Gab, even after the backlash. It was Gab who decided to remove the federation from their code and "go their own direction" (read "no security updates").
2021-12-06T10:35:07Z	(#fa6rvca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Maybe we can even borrow some stuff from it, like the lack of the profile picture border, that annoys me to no end. 😉
2021-12-06T11:43:32Z	(#uhdpkja) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Yeah, that's exactly what I mean. At this point, this should probably be the default theme for all the pods.
2021-12-06T13:32:34Z	(#uhdpkja) Tagging @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> and @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt> so you can see this reply too.  I don't think we disagree on too many things tbh. My main point is that the profile pictures on those kinds of themes look better in my opinion. The fonts are obviously something we'd need to make more consistent, if we wanted to move in that direction, the hash would also most likely look better on the very right and exist in the same line that the time does and yeah, the hamburger items should probably be a bit further from he logo indeed.  The thing where we might disagree is that I like the way this "next" button and double lines look and you don't, but that could probably be sorted out too.
2021-12-06T14:06:29Z	(#uhdpkja) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I guess... Well the theme we have now is fine and while I'm never happy with circular profile pictures, because they limit the space an artist is able to use, I know this is a battle we're not going to win without the ability to go back in time and stopping whoever first came up with them.  The border isn't as much of an "art crime", but I fell like it still, at best adds nothing and at worse interferes with the border often drawn in transparent images, which I can also live with, but I'm by no means happy about.
2021-12-07T08:45:50Z	(#dvuneva) @<fox https://twtxt.net/user/fox/twtxt.txt> What a nice coincidence, you got an icon that looks a bit like a pixelated fox head. 🙃
2021-12-07T08:48:44Z	(#fxtbjda) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> It's a bit of an overkill, honestly. 😂
2021-12-07T21:56:29Z	(#axk4ieq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Speaking of the things we have yet to decide on, what about the whole "theme related changes thing"? 🥴
2021-12-08T13:54:52Z	(#62en5xq) @<yarn_police https://twtxt.net/user/yarn_police/twtxt.txt> Good joke, unfortunately nothing gives you the authority over the canine master race. 😏
2021-12-08T19:36:03Z	(#62en5xq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> As an inugami, I'm pretty high in the canine hierarchy, so I'd hope those K9s would switch sides, if not to honor their overlords, than at least out of purely practical reason. It's no-doubt easier to bite a few officers, than trying to fight a 120cm high (180 sitting) mythical canine, that can claw you open in one swing of a paw. 😂
2021-12-08T21:25:06Z	I would like to start a thread on the potential improvements to the profile pictures in this theme and for everyone to add their opinion under this issue I've opened up, to explain my position in more detail: https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/594
2021-12-09T12:16:21Z	(#j2adrsq) @<novaburst https://tilde.cafe/~novaburst/twtxt.txt> Welcome back! That would indeed be a pretty cool project and maybe we'd even see you posting and replying to things here more often. 🙂

2021-12-12T12:28:41Z	(#zgh6xda) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Yes, the way it now looks on your pod is exactly what I wanted it to be! Sorry for not replying earlier, I’m sick and spent yesterday in bed.
2021-12-12T12:32:56Z	(#ijithla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Why? Should we just have no alternatives to money?
2021-12-12T12:38:34Z	(#4v3naiq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Not sure if I like the time being up there and also blue. Kinda makes it look like a part of the nickname.
2021-12-12T13:03:42Z	(#vphyjcq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I think they'd be a good idea, helping people explore the communities on the other pods easier.
2021-12-12T13:06:55Z	(#urp4ifq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I red through most of it and think that at least all the changes mentioned here would be an improvement, compared to what we have now and make this default theme pretty great in general. 👍
2021-12-12T13:34:21Z	(#ijithla) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I’m pretty sure that if you turned it into $SAND tokens and put them on the blockchain, claiming that each token is baked up in value be a dollar worth of sand you physically own, the “crypto bros” would buy all that sand in a matter of minutes. 😂 *Posted again, because it looks like it did not mention you correctly - again. Looks like the mobile app likes you even less than you seem to like it.
2021-12-12T20:48:11Z	(#urp4ifq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  I'm already feeling better, it's nothing serious. Just the usual winter cold, one has to go though at least once every winter. 😄
2021-12-13T11:54:47Z	(#427i2pq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> As I said, I think it's good to have some alternatives to money, especially when the inflation strikes and the governments money printers go brrrrrrrrrrr. I don't think Bitcoin is the ideal alternative we need and I'd prefer some better kind of a stable Internet currency, everyone could pay with online.  As for the guy, I don't feel too sorry for him losing the thing, but I feel sorry that he got it to begin with. It's the exact same thing as a lottery winner losing their winning ticket. The knowledge, that you could have been that rich, if you didn't make this small mistake, must be something that haunts one for the rest of their life.
2021-12-13T13:43:30Z	(#427i2pq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Yes, but there are many contributing factors to inflation, so some countries and currencies are effected more than others. Therefore there is value in having alternatives, be it other currencies, stocks, precious metals, art or whatever else people put their wealth into (Internet coins included - maybe). I'm also not saying that money is related to happiness, as I myself would much rather died poor and have my work remembered by the world, than die rich and be forgotten, making my life overall meaningless.
2021-12-15T16:48:47Z	(#fg7vu6a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I not only remember jQuery, I still use it for the sliders in my old Spotify playlist making app at https://spup.giltch.me along with the newest version of Bootstrap 4. 😂  It was originally using some ancient version of jQuery, that didn't even work on phones without a workaround and some old version of Bootstrap 3, but I do everything I can to keep it safe and up to date. Maybe one day, I'll even force myself to rewrite the jQuery part out of it, but it definitely won't be any day in the forseeable future. 🙃
2021-12-15T16:52:33Z	(#2d636tq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, this is probably the best way, other than the icons being in an unusual order, rather then the logical "reply, fork, edit and trash". 🤔
2021-12-16T09:43:49Z	(#zydisba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah 22, but I forked the app from an older project, maintained by someone, who worked at Spotify, at the time. Maybe that's one reason why jQuerry was still there, but Bootstrap is still used a lot these days and all versions older than Bootstrap 5 (the newest), still require jQuerry for some of it's things, like the sliders used in my app.
2021-12-19T11:03:22Z	I really like the new design, but on some mobile browsers, it tends to cut off the last line of he Twts. 🤔 ![](https://twtxt.net/media/pjuMGUmKSpV2Jg7fFEHjUE)
2021-12-19T13:02:27Z	(#wc2zigq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> Puffin Browser, so not even really a browser. The sites are rendered on their server and that server is, as far as I can tell, running something based on Chromium 79. 🤔
2021-12-21T20:22:25Z	Love the new logo and design, but something weird is going with the app.   ![](https://twtxt.net/media/MLV8k8t7kgzq2bLr6L4oKo)
2021-12-21T20:26:31Z	(#jl6emhq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's already an evening here, so I don't think I'd use it today anyway, I just wanted to check things and found out that I was logged out and getting this error message, when trying to log back in.
2021-12-21T20:31:21Z	(#jl6emhq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> No problem. I just hope the app can get some of the new web features or at least the correct cross-pod mentions with correct spacing some time soon.
2021-12-21T20:46:10Z	(#jl6emhq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> In fact the mobile site might now be at a point, where if modified to be always logged in and maybe few other small changes, it could just be turned into the new phone app, just adding a bit of magic "app code" around it. 🙃
2021-12-21T21:03:22Z	(#3hwhppa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I remember that, just wondering if it shouldn't be moved from the long term plan to current plan, as the current app seems even harder to update, than what it'd take to make the new from the site, unless I'm missing something. 🤔
2021-12-24T21:24:11Z	Here from the new phone, to wish you all a Marry Christmas!

I don't have one myself, but we have one that's kinda similar, at the place where my grandparents live.  I still relate to the story though, as I sometimes also just get hats for fun, like the Santa hat, that I got just so I could wear it to school, during the last week before Christmas. It might also come in handy, if he ever decides to travel to some place where it's cold. 🙃

2022-01-07T19:16:50Z	(#rxnowqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> You won't find a good XMPP client for iOS, even on Android it's only blabber.im that I find usable enough for what I need from a phone client.  Something that was not yet mentioned here is https://inverse.chat, which is a web based client that can run on almost anything and it's good enough for what it is.  It can even be used on a phone, but it is by no means a pleasant experience, but than again, what even is pleasant on the iOS. 😏
2022-01-07T20:57:11Z	(#rxnowqq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I don't know for sure, but according to the text on their GitHub, it should be able to run, when the browser is in the background and give some kind of notifications (sound if I remember right). I can't confirm any of it, as I've only ever used it for quick checkups and use blabber.im for like 99% of my time on XMPP. So I wouldn't recommend Inverse as your main client, especially not on mobile.
2022-01-07T21:07:16Z	(#rxnowqq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> You can call me a troll all you like, but it doesn't invalidate my point, that Androids sideloading (that idiots like Tim Cook love to go against) and more developer friendly environment, led to there being good clients for XMPP and Fediverse, as someone would come out and make a solid base, that others would fork and expand upon, eventually turning it into something that fits the needs of the community. On iOS everyone always starts over, making their shitty little things and than you wonder why none of it feels finished. 😏
2022-01-07T22:26:12Z	(#rxnowqq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Who would I even be trolling? I'm not trying to make you angry, it's just some friendly banter and you can't deny that there is some truth to it, especially when it comes to smaller projects that have no way to monetize (especially if the developers themselves don't have Apple HW).  I'm not claiming Android is perfect either and I hate Google for many reasons, but we are at a point when you're more or less forced to choose the better trash - in many ways.

Still this way of keeping the slots seems insanely stupid and wasteful, if the planes really flew and weren't just entered into the system to meet the requirement or what not.
2022-01-08T08:38:26Z	(#nwas2lq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Despite me still hating both this and NFTs, which I'll probably hate forever (or as long as they keep being ab-used for "art"), some at least moved from Ethereum to Solana (https://solana.com/environment), which I don't know too much abuse, but it seems to be a lot less energy hungry. 🤔

2022-01-12T20:17:11Z	Just finished making a new banner, though sadly most sites (including this one) don't really support profile banners anymore, so I'm at least submitting it as a picture.  Sorry for the lack of activity, I'm having to deal with exams and other university stuff. Also if you're wondering what those letters mean, they're my less known nicknames "Canines Always Win" and "Year Of The Canine". 🙃  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/RZL3kBPBBHrffzVDBctbrK.png)
2022-01-12T22:27:25Z	(#oyflmta) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I usually do my art one pixel at a time and a filling tool, but here I cheated a little, by making a 25x50 canvas with the white text and putting six of them next to each other and only than coloring some of the litters in, to add the big CAW "on top". 🙃  Tools are Pixel Station (Android only) for drawing and the web app at imgonline.com.ua/eng for edits.
2022-01-12T22:39:06Z	(#oyflmta) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I still live in an apartment with the rest of my family, so I don't have any dogs. I wouldn't want to make dogs live somewhere, where they don't have enough space to be happy either way.  Even if I ever find a place that'll be more suitable for dogs to exist at, I don't think I'd ever get more than two of them, so you don't have to be concerned about me ending up as an insane person, becoming one with some wild pack of dogs. 😄
2022-01-12T22:56:10Z	(#xqu2i4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Not this one. It's pretty nice for a web app, but it lacks the option to show a grid or use custom colors, so it'd be hard to use for the stuff I do, but since it is on GitHub, someone could add those options eventually.  Speaking of things on GitHub, there is this great pixel placing game there at https://github.com/chetbox/place where everyone who visits the site it's running on can place pixels and thus they can all create art together, or fight for control of the limited canvas, depending on the community. Since you are into hosting all kinds of things, maybe you could host a canvas for Yarn, to see what this community can do with one. 🙃
2022-01-13T17:59:36Z	(#rwnngea) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I have somewhat of a problem with it BECAUSE it is a paper or a stupid and broken phone app - both of those things are unreliable. A paper gets wet and turns into mush and an app stops working when you need it the most or once you run out of the battery.  We live in the 21th century, so don't tell me we don't have the technology to link the certificate to the ID card, or another thing we already carry and give the people checking them some device that can check that.
2022-01-13T18:09:56Z	(#rwnngea) @<tamer https://twtxt.net/user/tamer/twtxt.txt> Let's all be honest here, non-mRNA COVID vaccines already exist and are offered by some governments (https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/switzerland-buys-non-mrna-covid-19-vaccine/46988592), you'll most likely get the choice to take one soon, so I'm asking if you'll take it, or is this just an excuse?

2022-01-14T11:29:08Z	(#dhbbtda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I guess Android might be getting a little shiba-phopic lately. First they replaced the shiba emojis with some generic mut, that just blends in with the background in Android 11 and now you can't even load up the shiba model from Google without it twitching like this. 😒  *It's not just my device either, the model from that link seems to work fine on all kinds of devices, but friends who also tried loading it on Android also had it glitch like this and work on their computer OS.

2022-01-18T13:51:21Z	(#qy2y3oa) To be honest, DRM on books is just stupidly ineffective, which I can prove, even by pointing out that this very book can already be downloaded in PDF from quite a lot do "book archival sites".  I'm not going to just throw the PDF up here, as I don't think the author deserves that, but if you want a DRM free copy, you can throw him the $15 somehow and either read it in browser at booksvooks.com or download the PDF from z-lib.org.
2022-01-18T14:18:00Z	(#lmj7tya) What I’m saying is just that the only way to protect any book, is by never putting it online at all and making it some size, that makes it hard to scan. If you ever make an e-book out of it, DRM or not, it will be circulating online in no time, making the DRM pretty much pointless.

2022-01-19T18:55:26Z	(#3cooobq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> What businesses use is usually the worst option, as proven by the Microsoft example. Teams are being shoved down all of our throats and despite the fact I hate Apple, I have to admit that I don't think anyone but Microsoft would be able of making something, that fail at being an app this hard - to the point where I'd consider it malware, or at the very least bloatware, that I couldn't bring myself to keep installed on my machine and now refuse to use outside a somewhat isolated browser, running incognito mode.
2022-01-20T09:17:37Z	(#3cooobq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I always go out of my way to opt-out of any data collecting thing they try to push and use a WinOptimizer (from Ashampoo) designed to block and sabotage as much telemetry as possible, in hopes that it at least gives me some level of anonymity. But I know the average user doesn’t even read those things and just clicks "Next" until Windows setup finishes with the default options - to track everything.
2022-01-20T09:26:45Z	(#2hkv6va) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> Naming conventions be damned, but if a pixel is discolored (even ever so slightly, to the point where no one would ever notice) or misplaced, I will not sleep, until things in this world are right again!  Not to mention some sites image resizing capabilities, that blur or stretch a part of the image and make me violently angry, so I’m glad Yarn is not one of them, unlike Twitter or Facebook/everything made by "Meta".
2022-01-20T09:58:48Z	(#gvra2jq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Don’t know how they work exactly, but I don’t think I’ve seen any profile pictures appear blurry or stretched.
2022-01-20T10:06:48Z	Good to know Microsoft Teams can just break your microphone when using a different browser. You will hear everyone else, but they won’t hear you. Now it happened during a university exam and almost fucked me over.  I still passed, but just barely. I don’t care about grades anymore, but since it was design-related, it still hurts my ego and ruins my day.
2022-01-20T10:38:09Z	(#gvra2jq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Downscaling is not as much of a problem as upscaling, as some sites do that using weird methods and especially in case of pixel art, using anything other tnan "nearest neighbor" for resizing can be really damaging to the quality, to the point where some artists advocate that sites should offer their users a choice between multiple methods of resizing for their art, if the website ever plans to resize it.
2022-01-20T10:47:19Z	(#f4og56q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, the popups were also lovely, especially the fact most of them were just completely pointless, like giving you annoying chat popups for every single message, if you dared to not have the chatbox open.  I also loved that version where too many chat popups could actually obstruct the chat, to the point when you couldn't even respond or see some messages in there, cause half of the chat was behind chat popups that appeared before you opened the chatbox - peek user experience. 👌
2022-01-20T11:05:34Z	(#gvra2jq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The problem is that "nearest neighbor" resizing is the best option for pixelart, but using it to upsize other art or even photos will make them more blocky.  If you only ever downsize both of these methods should produce good results.
2022-01-20T11:16:28Z	(#aahy6na) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> Because we already live in the dystopian future, where most people don't seem to care about privacy and let the big companies harvest and sell their data, without any kind of real backlash.
2022-01-20T11:42:48Z	(#aahy6na) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> I try, but despite the friends and family finding it somewhat interesting, or sometimes even bringing these topics up themselves, they still usually download Chrome onto their new device or do the thing I was trying to warn them against, right after or while I'm still telling them why it is bad, so I can't help but feel like "my words are falling on deaf ears".
2022-01-20T11:45:14Z	(#aahy6na) When it comes to Windows, I never pay extra for it, as it already comes installed on the devices, that I get for my stuff and keeping Windows on there usually makes doing said stuff easier.

2022-01-20T12:04:18Z	(#gvra2jq) In “Lightbox” and “Gallery” they also do not move in the box that pops-up, when they are clicked.

2022-01-20T12:32:23Z	(#gvra2jq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I was being a bit too vague. The popup box doesn't have them moving only when "Use Original Media" is on, which makes them move on the page, but not in the pup-up.  I was testing all this on the Twt that I just posted, that has three identical gifs of bouncing canines included in it.
2022-01-20T16:34:58Z	(#dwh5mka) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> It is complete authoritarian bullshit, but I don't know how many people would it even effect/how many devices would even use such a bad DNS server by default. 🤔
2022-01-20T16:52:19Z	(#f4og56q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Being kicked during calls isn't exclusive to Linux, or at least not for us, as our smart and lovely management though it'd be great to set 2FA authentications to happen as often as possible, to the point when they often happen during calls. Eventually we had to give up and either give management remote access to our personal devices we connect with (only way to extend the interval) or do the 2FA bullshit again before every call, to make sure it doesn't happen during it.  If you wish to connect from an incognito browser, you still get an extra 2FA verification every time, just to be sure that you don't have it too easy.  In my opinion the lack of theming is also something maintained to please the management, as for some reason they're always against any kind of personalization of anything, to the point where you're not even allowed to have a profile picture in anything Microsoft related and if you try to set one, you'll get an error message telling you to ask management for approval, which they don't give. Thought I've seen a few people who somehow got one, so I guess if you take a high ranking manager to the showers where the camera doesn't shine and the soap be kinda slippery, it can still be "negotiated".
2022-01-20T17:42:45Z	(#nhelsza) @<markwylde https://twtxt.net/user/markwylde/twtxt.txt> Windows 11 is somewhat better (cleaner) than the mess Windows 10 ended up being, 10 was still a big improvement over the ugly an unusable Windows 8, so maybe things are finally somewhat improving for Windows.  I'm obviously hoping the future will be filled with more desktop Linux and other alternative operating systems, but I'll take Windows over Mac OS any day and I don't feel like I'm ready to switch to Linux on my main machine either, as a lot of the things I have to use for university are not available for operating systems other than Windows.
2022-01-20T17:56:56Z	(#nhelsza) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> Not sure. If your machine is more Intel based* and you like the design, I'd go for it, otherwise I'd probably wait a bit longer.  *There were some AMD processors that Windows 11 had trouble running with, making it a lot slower than Windows 10 on those machines, but maybe that's already fixed.
2022-01-21T12:31:34Z	When I was joking about profile pictures devolving into even worse shapes in Web 3.0, I was not serious, but sadly not wrong either. Now for the low price of 3 dollars/month and your dignity, you can have your Twitter NFT profile picture be verified, by being put into a hexagon.  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/URf7kSVZwgAcV6MaEw8Jtk.png)  https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue
2022-01-21T14:21:21Z	(#tfad4hq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> I have a lot more disposable income than this, but mostly because I don't dispose of it, paying for bullshit subscription services like this one or Discord Nitro, that only exist to put features other sites offer for free, behind a paywall. 😏
2022-01-21T14:36:30Z	(#tfad4hq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> I'm not saying those features are bad or value-less, I'm just saying that Nitro started as an "optional donation" to help keep Discord afloat, but once they've seen the money comming in, they got greedy and and started putting features that were never before considered "premium" on other sites behind this paywall and literally calling it an "upsell" in the inside docs. 😄
2022-01-21T17:55:07Z	(#gfh3ajq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> "They can be distracting, and even cause issues to other users, which might be sensitive to flashes, constant movements, etc." can be said about any other gifs, even the ones on the timeline, but the other points seem valid, as making them ceoss-pod would lead to problems and having them work only locally is somewhat confusing. 🤔
2022-01-22T11:24:02Z	(#olijdpa) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Sad to see you got hit as well, but value can't only ever go up, as most of the scammers in the crypto space and Internets "financial gurus" want people to believe.
2022-01-22T11:38:59Z	(#olijdpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I must have miss-clicked, sorry about that. As for the topic of nicknames, I definitely think spaces should be allowed (outside of the beginning and end) and numbers should probably be allowed too, if they aren't already. 🤔
2022-01-22T11:48:44Z	(#olijdpa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I get that. If it's impractical, it's not a problem. I just hate when people see my nickname as one word, so being able to change it to either "the canine" or "TheCanine" would be cool and I think there are more people, who would also want the chance to capitalize some letters in their nicknames, so if we get capital letters working, there'll be less need for spaces. 🤔
2022-01-22T11:58:43Z	(#epj7qda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> No, if you add display names, that one can freely change as they please, I'll do so often and push the limit with any and all kinds of unicode I'll manage to shove in there, like I used to do on other socials. 😂
2022-01-22T15:58:20Z	(#olijdpa) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> If it's interpreted as some dog related pun, than I'm fine with it. That's what I usually do myself, just with changeable display names. 😄  Funny enough the canine used as my mascot has no canonical name, but thanks to an old file naming convention I was using, that made "Jim" a part of a lot of those image names, some started calling him Jim, so that name is the closest to canon. 🙃
2022-01-22T16:06:45Z	(#czf3exa) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Inflation hit my country as much as all the rest, but at least the bank where I'm putting my money now has some interests. While it's not enough to cover the inflation, it is currently from 2.8 to 3.6 % a month, which is not too bad, considering it was not even 1% when COVID first hit.
2022-01-22T16:52:58Z	(#czf3exa) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> It went up this high only a month or so ago, so who knows what the future holds. These are also above average rates, that I was able to get, by moving my money to a new bank, willing to pay more. There is also a rule that if the money you have there exceeds some limit (around 32 500 dollars in this bank, less than half in the average bank), the money above the limit will not have interests this good.
2022-01-23T09:54:21Z	(#2wh7r4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'll try mentioning @fastidious . He was the ony one I was unable to mention from the app, since he moved pods. 🤔
2022-01-23T09:55:30Z	(#2wh7r4q) And that's still broken. 😞
2022-01-23T09:57:41Z	(#gmsxx5q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yes, if your work is related to IT, you're required to give your take on it at least once every January!
2022-01-23T10:21:57Z	(#px6ifpq) @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> I sometimes miss the likes for some posts, but I'm glad they're not here most of the time. When sites have likes, I end up only ever posting pixelart (or memes) and not talking, since that is what people will like on these kinds of sites, but with new text posts (unless it's a reply to a conversation a lot of people are interested in) you rarely get any attention, so starting those gives you next to no replies or engagement and only makes you feel down, thinking nobody cares about the topic. 🤔
2022-01-23T10:24:09Z	(#2wh7r4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I know, I was just hoping it might have also gotten fixed by that change, by some kind of backend miracles. 😂

Even if we aren't, up to 6% of our annual revenue of 0 is still a 0 dollar fine. 😂👌
2022-01-23T13:32:48Z	(#cyaddnq) @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> I really like the first, the fifth and the last. The first would be good as a small icon and the pixelated text in the fifth / the last one would be a nice addition when the logo gets a bit bigger / is used on the site. 🤔
2022-01-24T13:45:41Z	Hey everyone, I'm experimenting with hosting pixel drawing games again, so if you have a minute and are on a computer, you can visit the new site at: https://k9-place.glitch.me and claim some pixels of your own on this new canvas! 😄
2022-01-24T14:15:39Z	(#kpg33xa) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Making it to people only being able to color one pixel at a time could be funny, but I assume most would give up, before their drawing would even really be visible on the canvas. 😂
2022-01-24T14:30:13Z	(#kpg33xa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm not that good of a programmer, so the code is borrowed. I've just updated some dependencies, change the default colors and restarted the canvas. 😂   I'm not even sure how long I'll be able to keep this site up, if it gets a lot of bandwidth, but this is the simplest implementation of this game to host, so if everything works, I'd like to throw the code up on my friends Gitea instance, so the Internet can hopefully have more canvases for people to decorate. 😄
2022-01-24T14:55:04Z	(#wmbfpdq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That's also cool, but I think it's a completely different thing, as it's good for individual or small group sketching, rather than a cross-site canvas for pixelart - which is intentionally never too easy to use, to hopefully make it some mix of old and new pixels. 🤔
2022-01-24T18:05:13Z	(#kpg33xa) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> This website is mostly just to test the concept. The code as well as the server it's currently running on are very far from something this project would need to achieve it's full potential or be as fun as I'd like it to be. But despite these shortcomings, it was able to convince a few people to consider helping me with creating our own JS-free code from scratch and making it into something more functional. 🤞
2022-01-26T19:18:56Z	(#fqpn4qa) @david @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> While it's not exactly "art", at least it's a cool robotic arm (for 2016) and it actually does something.  All I'm saying is that considered how "modern art" is on a never-ending trajectory down to shit, I'd be glad if it could at least return to this point, where you actually had to put some effort into it and not just tape a banana, squirt paint out of your ass, resell jpegs or sell "invisible statues". *Yes, those are all real "art projects", that we got after this one.
2022-01-26T21:13:27Z	@<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> now I'm following the new account, so time to test if I'll be able to mention it from the app. 😄
2022-01-26T21:14:03Z	(#x56gana) Miracles finally happening, can't even believe it myself. 😂
2022-01-26T21:39:37Z	(#fqpn4qa) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I was not saying it's less art-like because it's shocking. I just thought that as interesting as it is, it's not something someone painted or sculpted, but rather an interesting exposition with a robotic arm, that the artist probably got made from someone else and just found an interesting use for.  I should probably be a bit less judgemental, when it comes to other peoples art (which I'm still not as judgemental towards as anything I make), but than there are pieces I'll most likely never recognize as art. This category includes the random lines of paint, sold at some galleries to launder money, or the flat corporate design, made so generic it no longer evokes any emotions.  Even outside of that, if ones art is only bought in hopes, that it'll eventually be sold for more, rather than out of the desire to own it and find enjoyment from owning it alone, it'll also make me very skeptical about its value and "art status".
2022-01-26T21:47:42Z	(#qybguka) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I bet those numbers are a combination of users forced to use it (like myself) and people accidentally clicking on the new Teams thing that comes pre-installed in Windows 11 and pre-pinned to the task bar, in a way that's not that easy to get rid of.  I've definitely never seen anyone using it out of their own free will. 😂
2022-01-27T15:20:20Z	(#qybguka) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I'm not the guy making these kinds of decisions, but I was able to speak to two people who were in those positions last year (the positions to help decide what will be used in their institution).  Person A was from my university and told me Microsoft provided Teams for no additional cost, as they are part of Microsofts 365 plan that the university chose, but also said that the plan as a whole is insanely expensive compared to what others charge for similar services, so if the decision was only on him, he would have made a different decision.  Person B works for a private company and his story was similar. Because of Microsofts high prices their company went with Zoho, as their alternative to Microsoft 365, which also includes some alternative to Teams in their plan, however it was not good enough to cover all their needs, so they bought some Zoom licenses on top of that, which they said was the cheapest conferencing program that met the needs the company had and the price of the two combined still wasn't even close to what they'd have to pay for Microsofts services.  Both people and a few others also pointed out that Google was also offering very cheap alternatives and some of their conferencing options were even free, if the conferences didn't exceed some time and the limit of 100 participants.  All these people agreed, that Microsofts services were the most expensive, though I assume kinda "necessary" for some, as they include many other useful tools, like the license for downloadable Office apps for everyone, email solutions and the option to archive important conferences and share them (internally) through Microsoft Streams.
2022-01-27T17:45:41Z	Good evening ladies and gentlemen, it's your favorite canine host, back with another episode of "Art or Non-art"! In this episode we have a book, that's just fucking phone app icons printed on paper and sold for €60, with like two pages of text on icon design. Site: https://www.appiconbook.com/ Is it art, or is it not?
2022-01-28T20:23:26Z	(#cf7bctq) Work reform is definitely something that should be taken seriously, unlike this movement that can't even decide what it stands for and is infested by Reddit Commies or believers of similar broken philosophies, with pointless degrees.  For now I'll hold back on adding more, despite it being hard not to bite the low hanging fruit. I'd also suggest finding better ways of fighting for these reforms, ideally something people can actually take seriously. 😂
2022-01-28T20:29:27Z	(#2iwqiiq) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I guess it's at least something. We had apps for those things for a long time here (not good apps, but still).  I think it's not a step in the right direction, as the phone battery can run out, you can forget it at home or just not take it with you, when you go out for a walk or running. Why not just have one card you can put all this shit on, especially in countries like mine, where you're required to always carry the ID card with you anyway.
2022-01-28T21:04:29Z	(#2iwqiiq) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Ok mister phone addict. I sometimes go to university or visiting other places for a day or two entirely without it, when I just don't feel like bringing it with me.  I've also made it a bit of a tradition to just randomly go two weeks entirely without using it during summer. It was originally a summer camp thing, but I did it once or twice even as an adult. It's also a good test to separate the communities,where people really appreciate you for who you are and those who do shit behind your back, when you're gone for a couple days. 😏
2022-01-29T17:09:37Z	(#adqvb2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I don't know much about him and find it hard to describe him, though he seems to match the "weird weed-bro uncle stereotype", hangs out with Elon and some of the other crypto shill, "relatable" popular rich and guess some of these "medical weirdos" as well.  I only saw a few funny moments, that people showed me, but even then he's never too consistent with his views, like when after rightfully bashing modern art for being lazy in one episode, he dedicates the next few to shilling NFTs - which are usually even lazier.  I'm also not defending Spotifys financial decisions and since they sponsored The Emoji movie, it became clear to me, that they have no idea how to spend money and that peoples decision to crack their app is justified.  I still think it's really stupid to try to cancel him or his podcast. Podcasts were always about giving everyone a voice and the mentality of "I don't like this, so I'm taking my shit and going elsewhere" is not helping to seal the division online. On the other hand, this was most likely not the cause, but the straw, that broke the backs of those artists that Spotify always pays as little money as possible, while striking million dollar deals with these podcasts, not many even wanted on this music oriented platform to begin with.
2022-01-30T10:41:38Z	Are there and bots for keeping dependencies up to date and are able to run on Gitea? 🤔  I've seen something like that on GitHub and it made me wonder if some of the problems in the phone app like the small typing issues on both Android and iOS couldn't be caused by something being a bit out of date. 🤔   Sorry if this idea is stupid, it's one of those "throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks" kind of a suggestions. 🥴
2022-01-31T10:02:09Z	(#rdkzz5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Or gather the Australians here, quit your tech jobs and start a trucking group. That seems to be the only way one can fight for changes in 2022. 😂
2022-01-31T20:43:36Z	(#52tobpa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I don't know about that. I think there's still a lot of good keyboard out there to buy these days.  Mechanical keyboards have gotten popular again, meaning there's a lot of them to choose from and some seem pretty well built. Even some of the modern rubber dome ones feel nice, if you pay a bit extra and get a good one.
2022-02-01T00:14:07Z	(#ydbdupq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> No one does, but in the case if politics, it's always been the strategy to blame your shortcomings on something and this has made it easier than ever.  What I've heard and wouldn't find hard to believe, is that the algorithm and platform in general is over-designed to appeal to as many people as possible, so in case of politics, it's letting the leftoids report the right, than rightoids get removed, making leftoids feel like Twitter is on their side.   Then it lets the rightoids ban-evade, so they can feel like they're fighting the system and can live out their pretend revolution fantasies.
2022-02-01T07:23:33Z	(#noje4va) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> The UI wouldn't be much of a problem for me, ugly UI is what Mozilla is for, along with shilling HTTPS over DNS garbage, no one asked for.  Though there seem to be forks like WaterFox, that don't have any of these problems and might be worth a try.  As for Safari, it used to lack support for a lot of things and even if it no longer lacks that, it still lacks the support for my favorite video codec AV1, it doesn't even support video OGG and support of Googles video codecs were only added recently to desktop Safari and is still lacking from the iOS version.  One has to wonder, if Apple does it because of their incompetence, or because they own some patents in the patent pools of the inferior h.264 and h.265 codecs.
2022-02-01T21:34:12Z	(#isc7gea) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I guess that's a good thing, though I don't use SMS and even when I have to, I can't imagine myself ever using such a feature. I had no idea group SMS chats was even a thing that existed. 😂
2022-02-05T19:17:46Z	With the exams finally over, for better or worse. I'm feeling completely burnt-out, but I'm trying to fight that and the art block, to bring back some of the stuff that made people follow me. 🤞
2022-02-05T20:40:49Z	Some silly retro anime thing, to fight the art block with. No-one here knows me long enough to remember the meme profile pics where I had a pink wig, so it's definitely a first for you guys. 😂  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/f2GZvmyUyGUESXoGUCCoJM.png)
2022-02-05T22:10:20Z	(#tdxckvq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Now when you mentioned it, I can kinda see it, like that, too. 😄
2022-02-05T22:33:36Z	(#4thmkta) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Thank you. I'm sure everyone in my family must have it the same way - also being effected by my stress.  @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> This was the end of my fifth semester, so it'd normally mean only one more left to go.  Sadly things aren't going all that well for me and there was one exam I wasn't able to pass and will have to try again later this year. Worse still, the accounting (a side subject I have no use for) professor didn't even let me attempt the exam, forcing me to re-take the subject again next year. On top of that stuff, I still have a lot of writing to do, before I can go do the bachelor degree exams and we're expected to find a job/internship during the sixth semester, which is something I'm trying to do anyway - but now there's a lot more pressure.  So despite the fact the exams are over for now, I still can't help it, but feel some level of stress. Stress and anger, because I'm expected to be there at 7 in the morning, on even Thursdays, which means getting up at five, further destroying my already unhealthy sleep schedule. 😅
2022-02-06T08:02:59Z	(#4thmkta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> IT (Informatics),the same as most people here - I assume. 🤔
2022-02-08T17:42:17Z	Looks like Twitter no longer lets you see peoples old tweets without having an account there. Are they really that desperate for new users? 😒

2022-02-08T22:03:01Z	(#ew32cja) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I care, but still have to use it, to talk to those, who refuse to move. If it stopped being available, they'd have to find an alternative and there are not many alternatives worse than Facebook.  To be fair, I don't think it'll actually happen either. They're probably just using it as a tactic, to push against regulations they don't like.
2022-02-08T23:58:06Z	(#b5wanxa) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I should probably look into that at some point. I've already seen the pixelated theme on nfld.uk. It's pretty nice and reminds me of my website at flist.glitch.me.  The font on my "Flist site" isn't mine, it's from a game called Hypnospace Outlaw. It's a nice font, but it has it's flaws, especially if you're not typing in English or need less common characters.  I have another, even more pixelated font for those scenarios. It was originally missing one letter used in my language, so I asked the author for permission to add it. He agreed and after one or two unsuccessful attempt, I managed to get it right as well as make sure that all letters from other languages (including Russian) are also there and working. Sadly I never really found much use for the font afterwards, but I really like it and it'd be amazing seeing it used somewhere. I just uploaded it to @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> s thing, so anyone reading this can try it out at: https://files.mills.io/download/uni05_53.zip
2022-02-09T18:32:13Z	(#b5wanxa) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Which one?  The Hypnospace font was recreated by Senpaifurret based on tweets by Foone: https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1106095130816073728 and I found it on here: https://www.fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1811689/hypnospace-outlaw   Since it is so heavily inspired by the game, it's hard to give it a license, but those recreating it and the site list it as licensed under Creative Commons.  The more universal font is by Craig Kroeger, who has all his work and fonts at: http://www.miniml.com/ and there is a custom license the fonts are under: http://www.miniml.com/fonts/license/index.html , so that's also the license that applies to my fixed version of it, except for the "no fixing" part of the license, that excludes me, as I've asked for permission.  He also made many other great minimalist fonts, that you can check out on the site. Some are free and some can be purchased for $10 per font, though the paid ones only have Latin support, making them less universal the the free fonts with Latin, Central European and Cyrillic support.
2022-02-10T14:39:31Z	(#hacvlua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Not only that, but it's not even a good proof of ownership for these digital goods, when anyone can just take them and mint their own NFTs for it.  Whene you buy an NFT, you can't be sure if you're buying things from the people who made them or habe any right to re-sell them. It cdan always be someone, who just right-clicked it somewhere else, to make free money from the work of others.  There are even bots made specifically for scraping art pages, to copy and NFT-fy everything on there, enriching only those running them.
2022-02-16T11:41:33Z	(#fg6oyda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Maybe. He's definitely not having a good time lately, fighting both Apple and EU to keep his ad scheme running, Facebook bleeding users, stocks going to shit and most normal people not finding the idea of being stuck in the dystopian NFT-filled virtual reality that is the Metaverse all that appealing.  Yet that's the future he already bet a lot of his company money and resources on, so he's unwilling to back down without a fight, with increasingly desperate tactics, like renaming the company, it's employees and who knows what else.
2022-02-19T21:35:01Z	Trying this weird artstyle now. People elsewhere are already calling it confusing, so feedback appreciated - I guess. 😄  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/kgfCuRdfeQgk4WEPuQrcNF.png)
2022-02-19T23:31:35Z	(#2jmshbq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Not just you. You're probably the first one to notice it, but now I can see it too. 🙃
2022-02-20T10:33:19Z	(#2jmshbq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> No. It's still the usual doggo, just drawn in an unusual way. 🙃
2022-02-20T16:58:55Z	I'm even more mad at Spotify now. I thought they stood by Joe Rogan, because they cared about some level of "freedom of speech" in podcasting. Than they go and ban the more "controversial" podcasts, that are not Spotify exclusive like "Mad at the Internet", that most other big podcast platforms (including Apple and Google) allow.  I guess Spotify only cares about partnered podcasts and if you want something that's smaller, more local or a live radio station, you have to get a different app anyway.  Even if they still have the podcast you want, sometimes it doesn't even play right (stops/crashes randomly) and instead of fixing the player, they rather focus on the development of stupid technologies, that push the sponsors in big podcasts even more in your face or other gimmicks nobody cares about.
2022-02-20T17:14:43Z	(#2jmshbq) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I don't really like chihuahuas much, but I'll take it as a compliment, as it makes me and @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> match even nore and he's looking pretty cool with those glasses. 😄
2022-02-20T17:56:58Z	(#rdew6sa) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Not even I ever thought they were a perfect company, but it was the first and good enough. They used to have everything one needed audio-wise, all for free or a single subscription, if you wanted it ad-free.  I also knew someone working there (now they have a different job) and I got somewhat familiar with the API, which at the time was one of the best APIs for music apps out there.  It is also social networky enough to where if you want to see what your friends are listening to or listen to something together, this is usually the best platform for that and if you wanted to do it on Discord without bots, it's also the only one.
2022-02-20T18:35:59Z	(#rdew6sa) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I don't remember ever hearing about that. They always had all their music licensed, so I doubt they'd have any reason to do this kid of stuff for copyright reasons.  However the older versions of their apps used to be a complete mess (some still are), so some users running the Windows version of the app around 2020 - 2021 were experiencing spontaneous changes in playback speed, which could have been how this rumor got started. 🤔  Source: https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/Spontaneous-change-in-playback-speed/td-p/5044052
2022-02-21T13:39:26Z	(#7eain3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm no Mac expert, as you can probably tell, but I'm somewhat familiar with the browser development scene and know that quite a few browsers dropped their Mac support in 2021, because they didn't have the resources (or much of a reason) to port their browsers to M1. Not helping was the fact that development for Macs is hard for those working on non-Apple devices, so browser developers had to rely on Mac-owning volunteers willing to help. The number of those volunteers was also shrinking, since most Mac users just use one of the mainstream browsers these days, even more than those on other platforms - probably thanks to the AppStore.
2022-02-21T14:20:01Z	(#o2gqadq) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Can't tell you much of the top of my head, but as I said, it was indeed mostly the small ones, that try to maintain their own browser/layout engine (like NetSurf), or have it forked from some old version of Gecko - like Pale Moon, Basilisk and K-Meleon - all Goanna based browsers (the last one might have never supported Mac to begin with).
2022-02-21T15:26:25Z	Looking into Truth Social - Day1: - It's heavily Mastodon + Soapbox based - still an understatement. - It seems to have some weird side-wide reputation system, to ensure maximum echo chamber - might not apply to checkmarks. - Graphic design of the main page doesn't seem to be Donnies passion - especially not when it comes to phone layouts. - Registration is very confusing and seems to be working only through the iOS app, if one is "lucky" enough to get through the never ending queue and smart enough to register via an email, as phone registrations allegedly don't even work. - Many people can only access the site by using a VPN, as the anti-raid system is way too sensitive and often throws out users just trying to view the site normally. Conclusion : Everything about the site is such a mess, that I couldn't even be bothered to get an alt there, to troll the 5 people, who managed to somehow get in, despite all these problems.
2022-02-21T15:56:14Z	(#xsm76xa) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> The original plan was to join as everyones favorite American hero Jeb Bush and try to either shit-post him into the White House for 2024 or get banned from the site doing so. 😄  I wanted to do it day one, so I could grab some really good username for it, like "@potus47", which would make it even funnier. Sadly since the site is too bad to even get in, this political redemption for Jeb might be doomed from the start.
2022-02-21T20:07:37Z	_still wondering where @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> got that profile pic_

2022-02-22T18:16:45Z	Since the date today is 22.2.2022, I'm hoping to get in the tram number 22 at 22:22 to complete the 22 challenge. 😏
2022-02-22T18:31:47Z	(#prpzbkq) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I'll try, but trams usually only have their number written on the outside and sometimes don't even have a clock, so it'll be hard to prove it either way. 🤔
2022-02-22T22:22:51Z	(#prpzbkq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I managed to get in the tram a few stations ahead and ride inside of it for a while, exactly at 22:22 we got into one of the stops and started celebrating.   I guess at that point someone might have broken one of the doors or the poor tram was just so crowded, that it had to be stopped and couldn't be driven any further, creating a long line from the trams following it.  Sadly none of the photos I managed to get were any good, as it was just too crowded inside of the tram, while it was still moving.

2022-02-22T23:39:54Z	(#zqktm4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Don't know if I would be of much help with that kind of a thing, but the idea is definitely worth a try.  I still kinda like this app, but it has a lot of problems and it's a bit of a mess, so starting from scratch would definitely have its benefits.
2022-02-23T19:47:04Z	(#jfstoxa) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> It should not be up to the search engines to actively police its results and judge the content of the sites it finds subjectively. DuckDuckGo just buys those results from Bing anyway, so a lot of the times the quality of those results really is far from what I'm looking for, but for an entirely different reason.
2022-02-23T20:55:27Z	(#jfstoxa) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Ideally it should just search the Internet and give you what best matches your imput, no matter whatever that might be.  It is a tool similar to a map, made to do just that, rather than prioritize sites based on revenue, government input, domains, metadata or other opinions of the company running it.  Turning it into some editorialised nonsense has far worse consequences, like the abuse of these filters by the governments, in counties like China. Even putting that aside, do you really want these giant companies to have the authority to decide which opinions are right and which are wrong, when even during this pandemic, these giant companies were often labeling things as conspiracies and than walking it back once studies confirmed it?  In the very beginning, when videos of people dying from the virus were spreading from China a lot of these companies were even labeling this as misinformation.  I'm aware of the more dangerous conspiracies, like sites telling people to drink bleach to be cured (some even making money selling said bleach) or many other sites, giving similar bad advice, but even those should be dealt with in other ways, than through manipulating the search engine results.
2022-02-23T21:27:57Z	(#jfstoxa) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I quickly red through it and get what it's saying. But most of the times I myself use DuckDuckGo for that increased level of privacy and when they don't monitor what people are searching for, they don't run into these "problems" of feeling responsible to protect people against misinformation, like Google does.  Maybe the biggest problem of them all is the idiocy of the average reader. If people could develop basic critical thinking skills, no conspiracies would ever have to be suppressed and no "walled gardens" created.  It's similar to Apples reasons for going against sideloading, to protect less experienced users from being tricked into downloading viruses onto their devices. When in my opinion educating those users would be the only correct way, because it's the only way they can become experienced and get to enjoy some of the more advanced features and experiences the Internet has to offer.
2022-02-24T15:23:39Z	(#eihkmna) @<apex gemini://rawtext.club/~apex/twtxt.txt> Woah, that's pretty cool! Definitely looking forward to giving it a try, but hoping it'll have an AMOLED theme at that point, since I'm not a big fan of purple on white. 🥴
2022-02-24T15:39:59Z	(#z4hvddq) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> Hard to believe this is not a joke and someone in a position like he is can be stupid enough to double down on sucking Putin off. Even most previously pro-Russian politicians recognize what's happening now as war crimes and at this point co-signing it is hardly even pro-Russian, but more like "pro-Putin & friends". 🤦
2022-02-25T17:12:08Z	All my Flist sites: https://flist.glitch.me  https://canines.42web.io  https://www.nuegia.net/~canine/ now have a Ukraine flag ribbon on the top left corner, that I made using <div>s and CSS, to show at least some kind of support.  I know it doesn't help Ukraine in any way, but I still wanted to make it, so it's out there, for anyone wanting to put it on their sites or anywhere else. 🥴

I was only testing it in the app and it worked perfectly fine there. HTML probably shouldn't be on by default anyway, as besides these accidents, I can see people trying to abuse it to break the site or experiment with some malicious code in there. 🤔
2022-02-25T23:07:47Z	(#arbma2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well I think this is unacceptable too and I won't donate through Google either. Most of the "main apps" I use these days aren't on Google Play anyway, which once again shows the importance of sideloading and alternative marketplaces.
2022-02-26T19:30:00Z	(#pvhqlkq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Maybe not for the really private stuff, but if it's something you just need backed up, the more clouds it's uploaded onto, the better. 🙃
2022-02-28T12:00:49Z	(#dviefaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Do you really think the state/government has no biases whatsoever?  I don't think any online news sites should be paid for. There's already enough needless monthly subscriptions on the Internet as is.  However I don't mind having a few state owned/public radio and TV stations, funded from TV licenses, like we do here. These stations usually provide the best news coverage, debates and documentaries, as well as some basic coverage of sports, good enough for most people.  It's also good that there are now laws, prohibiting them from inserting ad-breaks into shows, unlike the commercial ones, that often insert so many of them, that the station becomes unwatchable.

Luckily I don't have to use MS Pain, with all the great free programs specifically for pixelart available these days.  The 64 x 64 limitation on the other hand, isn't that much of a problem, when it comes to this artstyle. This very image is still 63 x 44 at it's original size (excluding the white outline) and my profile picture would fit outline included.  If you really wanted to maximize the amount of canines per a 64 x 64 canvas, you could even comfortably fit 16 of these on there. 😄 ![](https://twtxt.net/media/8J7ugDGcQyR5cVPutA64tE.png)

2022-03-02T22:09:06Z	_watching everyone talk about cloud prices, while knowing that my pixelart and data is small enough to backup for free, pretty much anywhere I want_  There's also a trick with Google Drive, that can be used to join random organizations, that made their thing too open and if you choose one with stupid enough admins and name your folder on there something sneaky. It's a bit of a Russian roulette and it can get deleted at any time, if you get too cocky with it, so I obviously wouldn't recommend using it for anything too important. 😂

2022-03-02T22:33:36Z	(#dbn6ekq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I wouldn't have any problems with that, but as you mentioned, there's so many of them out thete, the chance all of them would do it, is pretty close to none.

2022-03-12T13:58:56Z	(#2kj5qta) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> That's fair, but if there is a switch, it better also include a "pure square" option, for the square purists like myself. 😄  Well correctly made or not, if you "install it" directly from a browser, I don't think it'll be as separate as I'd want it to be (not saving shit into browser history, cookies, fill-ins...).  What AppsGeyser does isn't creating a PWA, that's poor wording on my end, but even with well made PWAs, like https://app.revolt.chat, wrapping the web apps site through AppsGeyser ended up being closer to meeting my needs, than using it the intended way, despite it still being even further from native.
2022-03-12T18:03:07Z	(#2kj5qta) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> I think I prefer number three , but depending on colors chosen for the themes, the first one could also work, though I don't think it'd work well with an AMOLED theme. 🤔
2022-03-12T19:44:53Z	(#2kj5qta) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> The first one would be the obvious choice, if we plan to eventually add user banners. Otherwise there'd be way too much nothing around the profile picture and the other two would work better. 🤔

It's about being free to use your device and the software on it in any way you want/need to. I think even Windows and Android are leagues better, comparing them in this way.
2022-03-15T22:36:22Z	(#dsk6zja) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I don't even hate Apple, there are even divisions of Microsoft and Google, that I dislike way more than any part of Apple to be honest.  I think one can absolutely have a good reason to hate a company, that produces things they don't even use. The best example of this was Microsofts Internet Explorer, which for decades made lives of many web developers a living hell.  Some web developers argue site rendering on Apple products can still be somewhat lacking (even outside of missing codecs) and working in that area now, I can confirm a few sites had to be changed to show up right on Macs, though to be fair I don't know what exactly was causing it.  Also damn Apple, I really hope they learned how to finally make screens, that don't come off when cleaned.  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/oBDMei95n27YTKBw7FzHLL.png)  Believing me, I've seen this on almost every other Macbook, back during my internship in Ireland. 😏  Cheap shots (and there are many more) aside, part of me would still like to give M1 Macs a fair try, so if any of you work high positions at Apple and my approval is for some (even to me unknown) reason somehow really important to you, feel free to send me one of those machines for free and I might retract some of what I said, at least when it comes to Macs. 😄

It's so lame Trump doesn't even post there himself, despite being banned from most other places and him being addicted to Twitter in the past.  *with Android version "in development", but web version no longer mentioned anywhere
2022-03-28T17:39:05Z	(#kujx7ca) I think that Window 11a design is a bit of an improvement over the inconsistent UI mess of Windows 8 - 10.  I still have to use a lot of programs for university, that only run on Windows and are straight up impossible to run on an M1 Mac. I'm not blaming Apple for this, just saying that having Mac/Linux as your main machine is still difficult at best and impossible at worse in this country.  Windows is about as closed of an ecosystem as Mac and some things can be customized/edited , more than the average user would assume.  With the new Microsoft Defender no longer being just a meme and some other security improvements, Windows is no longer as virus riddled as it once was, though it's still no doubt very lacking compared to Linux and Mac in this aspect.
2022-03-28T19:00:59Z	(#iz5w4qq) @<mutefall https://twtxt.net/user/mutefall/twtxt.txt> Yeah, both Gab and Truth Social are Mastodon forks, but with some additional changes and no federation (Gab was originally a part of the Fediverse).

Despite it never being federated, it's the only one out of these three, that still remains compatible with the third party Mastodon apps (or at least claims to).  There were many accusations towards the site m, some saying this was the only instance, ever braking Mastodons (A)GPL license and not stopping when asked. Thought I don't remember in what way exactly.  It is also controversial for having all kinds of integrations, that judge links and people to determine who is "fake news" and who is not, as well as banning whole countries they consider bad, from using any part of the site and going on long rants about how that's totally different from racism or nationalism.  It's also known for it's weird side-projects, that now seem to include some kind of a VR game/metaverse, among other only slightly less strange things.
2022-03-29T07:20:41Z	(#gr5hp3q) @<novaburst https://twt.nfld.uk/user/novaburst/twtxt.txt> Don't think it looking like the corporate social-media is a bad thing, as long as it actually improves on that look and isn't ugly like post-redesign Twitter.  It getting kinda mainstream isn't a bad thing for me either, as that's kind of the goal. It needs more mainstream people to grow and become a real alternative to Twitter.  Though I wish it'd attract a different kind of audience, that isn't so happy to report/demand that anything they disagree with, has to be blocked for everyone.

I'll probably switch to using a more normal profile picture tomorrow, so I'll finish the day by giving you the full-sized picture of the current one, traced from the Rude Dog VHS cartoon. ![](https://twtxt.net/media/2hfC25SCWAN9T37SwNg3oZ.png)
2022-04-02T06:53:42Z	(#mnlbgxa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Woah, I'm definitely in favor of that idea now! I said I wouldn't aback up the original, but this one is definitely getting the backup - thank you!
2022-04-02T20:14:02Z	(#mq56zra) Could someone who already follows the new Darch account please at him, so I can get on the profile from here and start following him too.  I was trying to do it the other way already, but I don't think that worked all that well this time. 🥴
2022-04-03T11:04:20Z	Look, they managed to do it! They still found a way to make Odysee even more of a scam: https://odysee.com/@Odysee:8/premium:1?r=2bHbKKGWFruefZK6Q3fF2kH5SbEEj8Da
2022-04-04T10:51:51Z	(#wexnrrq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Funny they don’t even take their weird useless crypto in exchange for these premium subscriptions. It is also just a frontend for LBRY, so it’s a bit strange that an alternative frontend will now have ads and paid subscriptions, while the original app won’t.
2022-04-04T16:33:07Z	New profile picture. It was a pixelart project, trying to make it as small as possible, while not missing any details. ![](https://twtxt.net/media/TfMaM8sssENNvq9mwrRxbh.png)
2022-04-05T05:13:19Z	(#rrgofoq) @<mutefall https://twtxt.net/user/mutefall/twtxt.txt> I tried making something animated a few time. The app I use can do gifs, but all of the changes between frames have to be done manually (pixel by pixel), so it takes a lot of time.
2022-04-07T06:54:11Z	A short responses to the browser thing. Now thinking about it, it's sad Opera despite being Chinese owned, linked to scams and overall shitty, still remains the best choice I have, for what I usually need.  Still when I need to test sites at work, I often just use the browser I mede, because it doesn't cache everything and it's not filled with cookies, so one can actually see how the site currently looks and not some old and broken cached version.  It's amazing the competition is so shitty, that despite all their sabotage, one student with not much time was able to make a browser, that may not be able to compete, but is still somehow more useful for webdev.
2022-04-08T16:48:42Z	(#t4dyocq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'd say that at this point, most (including mine) are Cromium based, which is giving Google a lot more power than they already have and letting them get away with bending the web standards as well as the direction that most of the Internet is heading.  Chromium is also a security nightmare, with critical vulnerabilities having to be patched on almost weekly basis, so at this point I'd love to see at least one engine starting from scratch and having the funding and team, allowing it to eventually catch up.
2022-04-09T08:36:06Z	(#t4dyocq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I could, but you'll probably get a way better look into what it is, looking at the source code of CefSharp - the thing I use to embed Chromium into my C# browser app.  CegSharps GitHub: https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp  Download link for my browser (Windows only): https://flist.glitch.me/canineum.html
2022-04-12T17:32:16Z	This version of me, was made exclusively for the https://fedi.place/ experiment, similar to r/Place. 😁 ![](https://twtxt.net/media/eX2qQgg38onmWNb7xDpyYV.png) Sadly it ended already, so there was no time to ad a Yarn ball on there.
2022-04-12T19:41:27Z	(#5e6fgoq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> The colors chosen are cause of the very limited palette on most of these sites, but I don't want to complain, as that challenge ads fun in it's own way.
2022-04-12T19:44:27Z	(#5e6fgoq) @<novaburst https://twt.nfld.uk/user/novaburst/twtxt.txt> I should try making something on there eventually, but I'll have to look into the best way to get there on Windows and how to convert my style into good ascii art.
2022-04-26T08:00:19Z	Funny that @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> and Twtxt.txt is the exact thing, the previous CEO now claims he always wanted Twitter to be.  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/SyYBMKtEFuCnk7ceM5v2nE.png)

2022-05-12T18:54:34Z	Just a reminder that I still exist, along with some pixelart I drew today. ![](https://twtxt.net/media/Fn2ypjgNgo99yFGdZ5L954.png)

2022-05-27T14:06:23Z	Drawn yesterday or the day before, but I forgot to post it here, so here it the new doggo. 😄  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/oMpWKxr4p6jMpUVGEVLwgU.png)
2022-05-29T17:13:16Z	(#wcxw6eq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> He's just fluffy, but good theory. 😄 I also made a smaller version, that I plan to use as my new profile picture here.
2022-05-29T17:16:09Z	The previous picture didn't really end up working that well in profile picture sizes, so I decided to make a chibi version. It's new profile picture time! 😄![](https://twtxt.net/media/sGGUmWt74aap8v3xE5bWDX.png)
2022-05-29T17:19:20Z	(#bireljq) @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> Any chance you could print my profile picture on a piece of paper and try measuring it with the device? I already had my art judged by a few AIs on the Internet, but never had it tested for life force energy before. 🙃
2022-06-15T18:42:28Z	Kinda busy lately, but here's a header/banner thing I made for Mastodon. Also feel free to insert a joke about how retiring the mobile app, in favor of a PWA that's still "early in development" at best, might have not been the best idea here. 😏 But than again, who am I to call that out, when I have no time for similar projects now myself. ![](https://twtxt.net/media/Mh9ong7pxK9VpZsSVQLH7U.png)
2022-06-16T09:16:20Z	(#yxcnvmq) @<novaburst https://twt.nfld.uk/user/novaburst/twtxt.txt> Yeah it still kinda works on Android, I just hope the PWA that was supposed to eventually replace it is still in development.
2022-06-22T12:38:40Z	(#ajba5dq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re refering to as Yarn/social, is in fact, twtxt/Yarn/social, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, twtxt plus Yarn/social. Yarn/social is not a microblogging system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning twtxt system made useful by the twtxt...
2022-06-22T12:50:52Z	(#ajba5dq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Don’t take it too seriously. It was just a joke reference to the GNU/Linux copypasta. :P
2022-06-28T12:01:11Z	(#3ijpiva) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Selling data should, but not advertising itself. If it was, most free to use sites/apps would have to go with some kind of a paid subscription of beg for donations even more agressively.  I know it's a bit hypothetical coming from me, with my relatively agressive adblocking settings, but I was fine with ads, before they became the intrusive privacy nightmare, that they are now.
2022-07-03T21:10:07Z	Tried making an even more low-rez version of the current profile picture. Probably too low-rez to be used, but wanted to share it anyway. ![](https://twtxt.net/media/mJCYC2ZCVBFTi9eru9zEhF.png)
2022-07-07T13:51:32Z	(#3nr4ekq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Nice, but clicking the three dots in the top right corner and than "Register", doesn't seem to do anything. How do I get an account, or even better see all the public instances I can get an account on?
2022-07-08T08:31:18Z	(#6xpkria) Well time to start pumping that water manually guys! It'll be a good workout and the first step towards seeing you two on the next season of Australian Survivor. 😏
2022-07-15T17:14:55Z	I'm busy playing pixel wars lately, so not much posting or new art to post here. Still there is at least one new things those pixel wars brought me, the answer to the question "how small can the dog get?".  The answer to this question turned out to be 48 pixels (on a 9x9 canvas). ![](https://twtxt.net/media/K2iKYCq3JhwszgYYco2Yni.png)
2022-07-15T22:00:20Z	(#r5ag34a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I get what you mean, but even someone who has never seen me before, could probably tell, that it's supposed to be a dog, get some idea about the fur pattern, see twisty tail and the red collar.
2022-08-29T19:27:27Z	(#dqwn2ba) With the electricity prices still rising, contracts for it having to be re-negotiated and winter coming up soon (at least on this side of flat earth), they might soon start begging everyone to stay home, so they can save on heating.  Or at least that's what some universities here are already considering.
2022-08-31T17:21:53Z	(#cn2qg2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Busy, but not in a bad way. Mostly just work, at a job I no longer have, enjoying the holidays, and some studying for an exam I had today, that I ended up failing.  A part of my inactivity here can also be blamed on Google, as their last update to Android (12) broke the drawing app I'm using to draw all the pixelart I post here. Currently the only working solution involves having to run a virtual machine with an older version of Android on my phone.  It's not as impractical of a solution as it sounds, but I'd still prefer if Google could stop breaking compatibility or the developer fixed the app. At least it works now and my laziness/artblock are once again the only things to blame.
2022-08-31T17:30:57Z	(#bqaxpwq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<akoizumi http://social.kyoko-project.wer.ee> Same, especially the Dangan Ronpa logo. Thought it is in your own interests to keep such a "game" from happening here, especially when there is an inugami among you. 😅
2022-09-01T09:29:49Z	(#cn2qg2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's not bad, but it has some things I don't like. Changing colors is a bit tedious and un-doing is done pixel by pixel, rather than based on strokes (if you place more at a time).  It also doesn't look like placing transparent pixels is a thing. That usually isn't too much of a problem while drawing, but it makes the app unusable for other edits, that I usually also use these kind of apps for.
2022-09-01T17:11:22Z	(#cn2qg2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> My lack of free time aside, these aren't exactly issues, but rather differences in opinions and adding setting to allow users the choice between these preferences is probably beyond the scope of their project.
2022-09-01T18:14:11Z	(#cn2qg2q) ...to explain myself better, here is the color selection tab in Pixel Station - my favorite app for pixelart: ![](https://twtxt.net/media/QCxzBY4YQh3CascXuzJcUN.png) The top line shows the 8 most recently used colors, so you can return to them easily. The basic colors are always on the left, but on the right you get 6 variants of any color you're just using. Under it are the tools, needed to get colors from the image you're working on and tweak the values of the currently used color.  So as you can see, most other apps would have to implement quite a bit of changes, to make their apps the main art app of people who have a workflow similar to mine. And this is still far from a complete list of my "requirements".  This isn't a criticism of this app. I like it and hope if helps more people find joy in the creation of pixelart. I might even use it myself for some pixelated doodles when I'm online. I'm just saying it probably won't replace my main art app any time soon.
2022-09-05T07:51:56Z	(#zrry2tq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Not everything written about it on WiKipedia is true* and it did some good things too, like bringing some zoophiles to justice.  The problem was mostly their obsession with doxing everyone.  *a lot of these articles are edited by Frederick Brennan, who has in the past worked with the guy behind KiwiFarms, but hates him since then.
2022-09-05T10:18:11Z	(#zrry2tq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> when a person loves animals a bit too much in the worst of ways and does things to them one would rather not have to describe here.  What I was referring to was KiwiFarms helping to find people from a leaked zoosadist Telegram group, some of who were also harming children.  Obviously those actions don't in any way justify the actions of those, who used the site to spread addresses of their enemies, have people go after their jobs or make it easier for swatting to happen. If the site disallowed posting peoples addresses, things would have probably never gone this far.

2022-09-06T07:22:31Z	(#2v67x3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> buying dumb TVs is getting increasingly more difficult. We had one from LG, but it broke, so we bought a somewhat smart one from Hyundai.  It connects to the Internet (WiFi), but it has it's own OS, rather than Android TV and the microphone requiring features like Alexa are turned off by default.  It also asks if you want cookies before you start using it and doesn't make saying no to them difficult.
2022-09-06T07:29:32Z	(#gjvkaxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The malicious use is one of the things NETs are actually good for, as these tokens can't ever be fully deleted* from your wallets history.  So if someone has a public wallet, you can send them tokens with their address or other things they don't want public and it'll just be there forever, visible to everyone.  *the "art" "attached to" them can, the tokens themselves cannot
2022-09-06T12:07:41Z	(#2v67x3q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> It will, it's in the offline mode by default. You only have to connect it, if you want to use the built in browser, Internet apps or WiFi screen share.

2022-09-06T13:25:26Z	(#4vpsrrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you. At this size it still does, but I think this is the limit. The one pixel bigger canvas version still works better for the pixel war sites and I think that making an even smaller version won't be possible this time. 😅
2022-09-06T18:18:47Z	(#4vpsrrq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Thanks! It's been an interesting experiment, moving things around and seeing what parts could still be reduced to shave off pixels. Sadly all of those signs now point to this being as small as it can get, unless there is a completely different way to draw the head and legs, without ruining it.
2022-09-06T20:08:37Z	(#4vpsrrq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I wonder too. The idea started shortly after the previous one, with jan6 suggesting his way of reducing the size:  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/gJF6MpGSS9UuKqifjqmpan.png)  Doing so, he proved that a smaller version is possible, but while I liked it, I wanted to make the changes elsewhere. Mostly because shortening the legs always leads to people calling me a corgi.  Than there were two or so days, when I spent some time playing around with it, but only came up with bad looking results.  Yesterday I was once again trying to break my art block by drawing something big, though that led nowhere, so I returned to the smallening project, while I still had the app opened. That's when it finally came together somehow - in part thanks to getting rid of the collar.
2022-09-07T07:20:32Z	(#hufdb5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I've recently gotten more into sour IPAs myself. If you like sour drinks, I definitely recommend giving them a try.
2022-09-08T15:18:10Z	(#4vpsrrq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> No problem, I'm happy people enjoy the result as well as talking about the process.  Saying a few days might have been a bit misleading, as it was not entire days, but just some time during those days, usually alongside watching YouTube or listening to music.
2022-09-08T15:28:10Z	(#4vpsrrq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> Yeah, that's one of the many "joys" of making pixelart.  The previous (9 x 9) version of my profile picture was actually made primarily to be used on the canvases of the pixelart games played at https://rplace.tk , https://plaxe.chetbox.com and similar sites.  This one was made to see how small can I get, but it already found its place on two of these sites, one is even in a space so tight, the one pixel longer version wouldn't fit there.  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/ouahRR9px3vfZA9rwFZM7C.png)
2022-09-15T06:14:36Z	Is there still no way to get build 63 of Goryon on Android? Currently there's still only apk files for build 61 on the Gitea and I think the app is still not available on Google Play.  Also the url https://yarn.social/app still mentioned on a few places (like the Gitea) now gives a 404 error when accessed.
2022-09-19T21:00:50Z	Not to brag too much, but I'm the local expert of "technical minimalism". There's rarely ever more than 5 e-mails in my inbox. Onece I read it, in the bin it goes!  Whenever SW goes unused for too long, it gets uninstalled and I manually hunt down and delete all the cache and trash files it still left on my precious SSD.  I always make sure to uninstall all pre-installed junk from any device. I browse in incognito, to not waste my memory with cookies, history files and browsery junk.  What little junk spills through I run over using the Ashampoo WinOptimizer, that itself I optimize to ensure the most optimal optimizing.  All canines drawn reside in the cloud, I don't even have them all backed up locally, but I always use 5+ cloud/FTP services, just to be absolutely sure they're safe.  Yes, my "technical minimalism" might be getting slightly out of hand. 🤪
2022-09-20T06:31:37Z	(#gcldhuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What's new and when is it coming out for Android?
2022-09-20T20:32:46Z	(#fgfjvqa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Many optimizers are in fact just some kind of a scam, or fall into the bloatware category.  I can recommend Ashampoo WinOptimizer, because it's an old classic, trusted by users and companies for many years. It's paid, but the devs are friendly and are always giving away free licenses for older versions of it at https://chip.de .  The only downside is that (as the name suggests), it only works with Windows.  It did and probably still does have a free Android version, but last time I checked, it was very basic. If your Android phone doesn't already come with an optimizer app installed, I'd probably recommend SD Maid instead. It's free, but a small one time donation is required to unlock all its features.   Sadly I don't know if there are any good trustworthy optimizer apps for other operating systems, but maybe someone else does and can join this conversation.
2022-09-21T17:17:46Z	I'm done with the "smallening" for now.  I thought it'd be interesting to remake an older pixelart, that was way too "inspired" by Difros (https://difro.carrd.co/) work, to match with one of my friends profile picture at the time drawn by Difro.  Now I wanted to return to it and try making all the changes I regretted not making back than and in general make it more than a somewhat edited copy of someone elses work.  *They still look somewhat similar, because some changes were already made in the first edit from 2021. It was never just a re-color of someone elses art.  The original: ![](https://twtxt.net/media/DPbnqtJXmADQGsJh6Evrt5.png)  The new one: ![](https://twtxt.net/media/54qAwQDaceimRQMSqW26AF.png)
2022-09-21T20:13:17Z	(#w3gw4mq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> There's something about the client on this screenshot, that immediately makes my mind got to Temple OS. Rightfully so, you have clearly not surpassed the god given limit of 16 colors per operating system.
2022-09-21T20:33:34Z	(#l2phrpa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I scaled the eye down a bit and probably prefer this style of smaller, mostly black eyes too, which is why I use them in almost everything I draw.  I still think the other style might look better in some cases, like when Difro, the artist on the site I linked uses those eyes, because they always animate their art and need eyes that blink. For these animations, the bigger eyes just work better.  I also like the hint of color they have, because I always wanted to give my inigamis eyes a hint of blue, to make him a little different from other shiba colored four leged inugamies. I know - probably not necessary, as he's already rather specific, but it's also a bit of a reference to an old slavic/pegan god Chors, who was in some videogames depicted as having glowing blue eyes.
2022-09-22T06:13:06Z	(#l2phrpa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I never studied any kind of biology, other than the basics taught at primary school, so I'm probably not the most qualified person to answer this.  I know some dogs have blue eyes, I think it's usually light blue and according to the first few Google results, the probability also depends a lot on the breed.  Inugamies are a fictional race, so there's obviously no biological answer there, just the observation that they are drawn with big black eyes like mine has, in anime.  I actually have blue eyes in real life, but unlike most, if not all blue eyed canines, mine are dark to the point of almost not being blue.

2022-10-11T13:36:05Z	(#ngo44kq) I use XMPP and Matrix myself and was also very skeptical, when it came to the push to add crypto to Signal. Especially as someone who had to jump the Keybase ship years ago, for similar crypto and ties to a dictatorship (in Keybases case China) reasons. 🤔

2022-10-11T16:34:24Z	(#avd45ka) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Well a lot of the things in IT suck sadly, but it is probably better to also focus on the improving parts from time to time. For example people finally starting to worry about their privacy, or leaving big tech, to try out some alternative community hosted platforms.  Also things sucking is not exclusive to IT, as most things look nice on the outside, but when you get deeper, you find out the much darker reality of that field and in things like art the reality is much darker, than it is in IT.
2022-10-12T18:00:24Z	I'm starting to think that neither Twitter being bought by Elon nor it being left alone is the good ending.  I really hope it gets stuck in endless legal hell and bleed money, users and investors, for as long as possible - preferably until becoming MySpace 2.  I hate what that site is now, but I'd hate it even more if it became the "everything app" and the idiots involved in running it now ran our banking and infrastructure. Also WeChat, the app this idea takes inspiration from, is run by the Chinese government to monitor everything about heir citizens and outcast those not enthusiastic enough about it.  With Twitter already taking orders from politicians, I'm sure giving it even more control, would go just fine and definitely not turn into "man-made horrors beyond our comprehension".
2022-10-18T09:01:09Z	Looks like the ancient Android app for this thing broke at last. I can still see the feeds (albeit without any profile pictures), but no user profiles can be loaded, not even my own.

2022-11-18T23:18:44Z	(#d2jih3q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> To be fair, the DMs on these sites are never private, now it's just easier to guess who might be going through them and for what purposes.  This should ironically enough be considered an improvement, as before you couldn't even guess that, but sometimes knowing more makes these things less comfortable.
2022-11-18T23:32:48Z	(#b7ptmsa) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Giving Discord*, Slack and Reddit a check for "user-ran instances" is a massive stretch, as those "instances" still run on their server and rely on the mercy of global moderators, to be allowed to exist.  Discord can also be ran on ones hardware, using Fosscord, but than it's not very connected to the rest. This option is also used by only a handful of people, mostly those directly involved in the development of Fosscord.

2022-12-10T17:52:39Z	(#s5xb57q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> There are things that are valuable, even if you can't physically own them - for example intellectual property.  The problem with NFTs, is that by buying one, you don't own the art physically, legally or even digitally - you don't really own it at all, you just bought some vague digital receipt with a link attached.  So by right clicking and saving the file attached to the NFT, you actually own a copy, unlike the person who bought it.
2022-12-10T18:01:32Z	(#tszxplq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Wait, you put the presents under the tree this early, but don't open them until 24th or 25th?  You're supposed to wait for Santa, or whoever brings them in Australia, to put them under the tree on the Christmas day.
2022-12-11T11:16:18Z	(#s5xb57q) @<marado https://tilde.pt/~marado/twtxt.txt> It's still a convenient term to use for that category of laws, even if it is more misleading.  In case of art you're mostly dealing with copyright, or the license to use the art in some way. Patents and some other laws, one might find under the "intellectual property" umbrella are all good example of things that have value, despite not being physical.  Even if somebody wanted to argue against this, it's weird to draw the line between physical art and the rest of it. Would printing out the image or script to a theater play, suddenly give it value, that it didn't have before?
2022-12-11T11:41:10Z	(#s5xb57q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The rights to perform the play, would be what's most valuable. A printed copy would probably be worth more, than the digital one, because of the price of paper and printing ink.  But on the other hand, sometimes the digital copy has more value to people, because it's easier to share (both digitally or in making additional prints).
2022-12-11T21:10:16Z	(#s5xb57q) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> I'm all for less restrictions. The land ownership is a good example. When people in this country buy a piece of forest land, they don't put fences around it and let people and animals use it freely. In contrast, this obviously wouldn't work for all land. You wouldn't want strangers and wildlife randomly walking through your house - or at least i wouldn't.  Back to the ownership of art. I value my pixelart somewhat and part of why I started making it, was to stand out of the crowd, that is social media and have something unique and memorable, that people can recognize me by. I'm not crazy, so if someone randomly finds it somewhere and starts using it as their profile picture, I'll politely ask them not to, rather than throwing a law book at them and claiming non-existent damages.  With NFTs, the situation is different. People usually know it's wrong, but still felt entitled to just steal art and keep all of the profits for themselves, while the artist who did all the work gets nothing at best and a damaged reputation at worse. Even if the license the art is under allows it, I still see it as misuse of the art and the license, that was most likely intended for the art being used for some nice website illustrations or to help people express themselves online, rather than for someones pyramid scheme.
2022-12-13T18:58:38Z	(#i3wiyvq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Despite not liking Elon all that much, as well as hating Twitter in almost every way, I'd still give Elon some credit for at least tying to fix that excuse of a site, even if so far it's mostly just the CEO equivalent, of throwing shit at the wall and seeing if any of it sticks and slows the collapse of the house.  It's still better than the previous strategy, of looking away and pretending they don't see the holes in the walls and pedophiles inside of the falling house.  Obviously the best solution in my opinion, would be to bulldoze this poor excuse of a house/site completely and build a better one from scratch, but I can see how that's hard to do, when it cost you 40 billion dollars.
2022-12-13T20:59:39Z	(#7iworcq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> You can't say that it's been deboooonked, but follow it with evidence, finding that it doesn't happen as often, as people assume.  We can argue about the details, but the fact is, that on most social media recomendaitions are based on what you like, rather than providing you all opinions on what you're frequently looking at.  Most sites also show some bias in their moderation, on top of that, so people often end up on the sites, where finding opposing opinions is harder, than those they agree with.  This isn't enough to create an echo chamber in most cases, but just look around social media and see how many people are subscribed to blocklists, designed to filter out the rest, or just block those, who try to have a discussion, about specific topics.
2022-12-13T21:25:42Z	(#7iworcq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> I assume we're using the dictionary definition:  an environment in which the same opinions are repeatedly voiced and promoted, so that people are not exposed to opposing views: an online echo chamber; _We need to move beyond the echo chamber of our network to understand diverse perspectives_  Even then it's not obvious, at what point something becomes an echo chamber, or rather, it's left subjective. Still I find it bizarre, arguing that it's not a thing at all.
2022-12-15T12:10:05Z	(#eobktaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sure, go for it and get him here. I'm still waiting for him to apologize for crippling the original Twitter API or letting it happen.  That an a very detailed explanation, of what happened to project Bluesky. I'm not blaming him for that not being finished, it not going well, was one of the reasons he "left".  There were other things, that I hated him for in the past, but most of that is forgiven. I'd still make fun of him, for being the kind of basic bitch, who puts "#bitcoin" and nothing else, in his bio and a profile picture, looking to the side, focused on his ear hole.

They've just had it set to check user agents for years, while pretending they're actively working on actually making that thing be of any use.

2022-12-18T21:23:57Z	(#thxxbma) @<marado https://tilde.pt/~marado/twtxt.txt> This is pretty pathetic, but it might at least force the more "follow-worthy" people, to create a simple unique website, with links to all their socials, for them to link on their Twitter instead.
2022-12-19T17:00:41Z	(#kbiy7ta) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> but he said the dreaded m-word and that people can find him there. That's what broke that stupid rule, not the fact it was linked on the site.  To 100% comply, with how that rule is written, you'd have to just link the site, without directly saying what is on it.  It's pretty clear and somewhat funny, these people were never before on the dark side and have no idea, how to ban-evade.  Glad I left Twitter years ago, so I don't have to find ways around this garbage. If I had to, I'd probably end up making some indirect redirect site (with other things on it, as well) and put it on some really offensive, but technically still within the ToS sub domain - something along the lines of "elon-sucks-off-aids-infested-crackheads.coolsite.co".
2022-12-19T19:24:54Z	(#kbiy7ta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it's obvious, he bought a very shitty website, only valuable, because it has a lot of users, for like ten times what it was worth and many of those users hate him and/or are actively trying to flee into any other community, willing to accept them.  This policy doesn't have any higher goal in mind, it's just the "let's tie everyone to this sinking ship, that might make it sink slower somehow" kind of policy.
2022-12-19T19:32:01Z	(#2u3rigq) I thought, he'd use the poll to determine, if he should find some puppet to put "in charge" of the company, or stay the public face himself. 🤔

2023-01-01T20:39:36Z	(#xsi67zq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> 11 pixels in both length and height, but over 70 pixels in total - a lot more than the other tiny ones.
2023-01-01T21:06:40Z	(#xsi67zq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> Thanks. The face readability is a fair critique. I was trying to keep the ears and "hair" similar, to the previous one, just down-scaled.  That limited me, on how to do the rest, working with a canvass of this size. The result somewhat reminds me of some animals from the animated shows of previous two decades, or the artstyle they inspired, just in a very pixelated form.
2023-01-01T21:15:10Z	(#lt3fpqq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> I also have ears sensitive to earplugs and some headphones, but getting a big pack of cotton wool and shaping a bit of it to fit in there always works for me.  I'm somewhat of a fireworks fan, especially if they're bought and launched by others, more willing to waste their money, but I get it being annoying, if it's still going on a second night and preventing you form sleeping.
2023-01-01T21:44:30Z	(#xsi67zq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Me neither, that's one of the reasons, why I don't post pixelart more oftern.  Even when I somehow convince myself not to be lazy and find time to start trying, sometimes I just place a few pixels and realize that "today's not the day", or end up with something I don't like the look of and decide to delete.  The art AI also further encourages my laziness, as I'm more so a shitposter, than I am an artist. Before the days of AI, I'd have to draw meme posts in MS Paint or somehow convert them to pixels, but now I can get almost all of that painted a hundred different ways by a few different programs and choose what works the best, for what I'm trying to accomplish.
2023-01-01T22:31:52Z	(#buacqba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Idk, when it comes to art, I don't really hate it tbh. Mostly out of spite, because I think most of art has been on a downward spiral for quite some time. There's also the fact, that it can provide some inspiration or concept art, when needed.  Then again, I'm not effected by it much, as machine learning algorithms are having problems with pixel art. Combining a lot of pixelart images produces strange results, as it uses pixels of inconsistent sizes and distorts them further by blending.  When it comes to code, the arguments are a bit similar. The code optimalization on most projects these days, leaves a lot to be desired. I'm not saying I'm the one to talk, I'm definitely responsible for some spaghetti coed myself, but maybe that's something the AI could help us with, in the future.  Sadly I can also see there being companies, who might try to use it to replace their developers, as soon as they think they can get away with it and that code will probably be way more of a mess, than the code the worst of us can turn out today.
2023-01-02T00:36:11Z	(#lt3fpqq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Same. I enjoy the visuals and not the sound, so I too dislike the kind of people, who use things, that just make a pointlessly loud explosion, without anything nice to look at.  At that point you're just buying ear drum pain and the opportunity to annoy your neighbors and all the animals around.
2023-01-02T07:36:11Z	(#en4agmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't think Minecraft itself was ever open-source. Also when it comes to burner emails (that I assume can't be temporary in this case), is there any reason why go through all this, when you can just have an account on something like riseup.net, with a few strange aliases not linked to you?
2023-01-02T11:25:11Z	(#krffwqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Oh god, the Pocket Edition of Minecraft is pretty dreadful these days.  The controls are annoying to get used to at best and useless at worse, also literally everything in that game is monetized now. The last time I tried it, you needed a paid DLC, just to play sky block or similar mods. I know everything has paid DLCs these days, but this is literally paying, for the opportunity to have less blocks in your world, so you might even say, paying for more nothing.
2023-01-02T12:28:13Z	(#krffwqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> DownLoadable Content - usually of the paid kind and sometimes already in the game, but requiring extra money to unlock.

2023-01-12T09:46:37Z	(#ljv6a7q) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm still using the relatively old version of the Go/Flutter app and other than the two spaces at the start of a new reply, it being impossible to select text properly (while writing it) and the looping timelines, I don't see any serious problems with it.  I don't think it needs all the new features, fixing what's broken, finishing the rebrand to Yarn and making it easier to download, would be more than enough.   There's also the fact that while sending this reply, for the first time, the app got stuck in an infinite loading loop. Because text editing is broken, the best I could do was screenshot what I wrote - then OCR it back into text.
2023-01-17T09:51:18Z	(#47clcnq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> At least when it comes to personal use, it also depends on how much data you're storing, how important it is and how much you're fine with using dirty tactics.  For a lot of people the free options are enough, or the combination of them, at least. Neither is there anything, preventing you, from using alts on those services (other than the impracticality, of having everything on a different account).  For data you want to share, but don't mind loosing, there's also sites, that let you forcefully connect your account to some companys paid Google storage, that you can then use, until they find and kick you, or cancel their subscription - but they can never get your OG Google account banned for doing this.  Lastly there's also Chinese companies, that let you save upto 1 or 2 TB, in return for most likely mining that data, having it linked to some adware and wanting money for faster download speeds. These services can also be exploited to get those paid speeds and features for free and the ability to use it without the adware, making it usable, if you don't care if the data is private.  So you can have all the cloud you want, for free. What you pay for is privacy (or the illusion of it), convenience and the peace in mind, that you're not a "cloud pirate".
2023-01-17T19:50:42Z	I'm starting to notice replies to Tweets, after Elon took over, are now sorted in this way: 1)checkmarks 2)non-checkmark other checkmarks replied to mixed with checkmarks 3)non-checkmarks  We just unlocked the segregation ending, for "our online public square".

2023-01-28T09:07:32Z	This interesting video about AI art, just came out: https://youtu.be/nIRbN52PA0o  I already knew, most of what it was talking about, but found it interesting, that no company, developing music generating AI, was ever brave enough to use copyrighted music, for training. They all seen to have no problem, doing it with images.  It's not surprising, I've already expected it to be the case. It just amazes me, how they find a way to incorporate the "music is worth money, images are not" bias into everything.  It's more so a battle of lawyers, than artists at this point - or perhaps it always has been. With the corporations, using the garbage flat art and "nothing music*" for their interests and letting stupid and underpaid artists, eat the (usually deserved) backlash for it.  *nothing music/corporate music is a whole other chapter itself, if anyone wants to find out more about that, this is a good start: https://youtu.be/AIxY_Y9TGWI
2023-01-28T09:40:20Z	(#v4bk7oa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I don't think there even is an equivalent for other artists, you'd have to get your own team of lawyers with powerful connections. Good luck doing that with (in comparison) next to no income.  What I also find funny, is how music streaming services are a normal thing, most people use theses days. You couldn't sell people a subscription, to look at all the images. In some cases, you're even expected to pay, for the privilege of people seeing your art. _cough cough_ Facebook pages _cough cough_
2023-01-28T10:38:02Z	(#v4bk7oa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I understand people falling for "free" software, especially if it's something you're almost never using, but subscription services still confuse me.  How can someone be unwilling, to pay for a thing once, but happy to lower their monthly income for the foreseeable future, for it?
2023-01-28T14:06:31Z	(#v4bk7oa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't think banning it, is the right solution, as it can be quite helpful, when used the right way. I just think the works produced, should never be able to get copyrighted or monetized in similar ways. The double standard between music and images should also be addressed and either every artist gets fair compensation, or none of them do.  Sites should also decide, if they want to be an image board, or a portfolio site for artists and approach the situation accordingly, rather than trying to play both sides and failing.  Lastly, the situation should be used, to bring awareness to user agreements and the things companies put in there. Many of them already include, giving the company the right to use your work (be it code or art) to train some proprietary AI (GitHub, everything Adobe, DeviantArt...). This is where it comes full circle, back to the subscription based apps. They change their agreements all the time and always add these things, that let them monetize your data, so they get you to be the product, like the "free" ones, but they get to charge you for it too.

2023-01-29T21:21:58Z	(#hhsmcea) @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> There is not much one can do, other than avoid putting any of it on places, that get scraped frequently or engage in data harvesting, for some other purposes.  You can also check the site https://haveibeentrained.com . There you can see, if any of your images are already in the scraped datasets, used to train AI. If they are, you can request them, to be removed.
2023-01-30T23:00:53Z	(#hhsmcea) @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> No problem. The dataset the site searches, is only comprised of images, with very detailed text descriptions attached to them, as that's something all images used for AI training need. Therefore I think this site works more based on those descriptions, than it does recognizing the text on the images themselves. 🤔
2023-01-30T23:17:09Z	(#b2xqpjq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I guess unusual garbage in places, where one wouldn't expect it, is a problem everywhere. Still find it hard to understand, as even if you don't care about nature and animals living there, in any way, it still takes a lot of effort, to bring the furniture, car parts and heaps of other junk there.  I also doubt the average perso doing this, is carrying washing machines into forests by hand and when you're already driving around with it, it's probably simpler, to just dispose of it legally. In many cases it might also be closer, or get you a bit of money, for the scrap metal.

2023-02-01T15:55:39Z	(#hhsmcea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Google scanned all kind of books, to improve their search results - letting people find books and studies, based on any of the text in them, while not having the content of the books freely available, for obvious legal reasons.  Despite only doing that, it still resulted in a big lawsuit, that dragged on forever, then settled, only to be brought back to court again. Eventually Google won, more or less because their service did more good, than harm, for both book sales and people looking for books to do book things with.  This case was also recently brought up by many, when some artists filed a class-action lawsuit against Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, for their AI, trained, using copyrighted images.  This is just a "brief" and maybe not entirely accurate summary, mostly based on this stream, by Uncivil Law, who is a real lawyer and surely more qualified to talk about this, than I am: https://www.youtube.com/live/CwTWwvLRdeo
2023-02-01T22:45:10Z	(#hhsmcea) @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> There is a difference, between scraped data, used for AI training and the advertising companies, who track your behavior online, across sites, to better target you, with more relevant advertisements. These tools also give companies that use this technology, statistics about how people use their sites, so they can deduce, what needs to be changed, to increase their profits - but no AI is involved in any of that yet.  There might not be much one can do, to prevent what they publish online, from being scraped, to make some AI, but you can fight against targeted advertising and corporate analytic, by hardening your browser.  I think it's best to combine things like: Using adblockers, scriptblockers/filters, incognito modes, settings that delete everything, when the browser is closed, not allowing unnecessary cookies, logging out of services, right after you're done using them (unless you are sure, they don't track you).  There are more extreme measures too, but those are a bit of an overkill, for normal web browsing, in my opinion.
2023-02-01T22:55:02Z	(#6mdvn3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> "outsourcing" and "restructuring" are the hot new corpo buzzwords these days. The shirt economy and endless inflation we find ourselves in, probably isn't helping it either.
2023-02-02T19:43:50Z	(#o766mwq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Even back when I still somewhat cared about the site, the API was lacking (and that's putting it extremely nicely). In addition to lacking the support for many, if not all, new features, the alternative clients, relying on this not so great API, also had a very strict, hard limit of accounts, allowed to use them. That's why these clients usually didn't last long, or had a million different versions and charged their users to make those few user slots last.  Some might have had a better contract (don't know if that was just a rumor, or not), but now with Elon taking over, none of it matters - they'll all go away now. Sure, it might force people to use the ugly default app and see the ads, that it is full of, but I hope the users aren't this brain-dead and that it'll have a negative effect on the company, in the long-run.  Surely, there must have been a better solution, than shutting it all down. If the API was updated and ads included, in the alternative clients, or it had some other from of monetization, Elon could have removed the hard user limits instead and be seen as the good guy, like he was often in the past.
2023-02-02T21:25:27Z	(#hhsmcea) @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> By more extreme measures, I meant the things, that Tor browser does. For all that is holy, or unholy, please don't ever return to Internet Explorer - it has destroyed the sanity of enough web developers as is, we can't risk it's user numbers ever increasing - never!

I also think it's important to add, that no group, event or action, should be considered "protected from humor".  It's a feeling, hard to describe, but the Internet went for mostly toxic, with only a few sanitized places, to now almost fully sanitized. It ruined the fun.  The Fediverse fractured, mostly because some percentage of users, had to find a way to silence those offensive to them, for the entirety of their instance. I really don't want this place, taking the same path.
2023-02-03T20:00:09Z	The Nostr protocol really is a cryptobros wet dream. On Amethyst (the Android client), every account automatically gets a pointless blue checkmark - before it even has a name. You get the promise of free speech, in the marketing, but in reality, that predictably translates to bots, spamming vague porn ads and other suspicious links, new users begging for followers for a follow in return and most prominent of all, the people utilizing the great feature, to beg for cryptocoin change, without doing anything else and not getting any.
2023-02-03T22:05:08Z	(#hhsmcea) @<off_grid_living https://twtxt.net/user/off_grid_living/twtxt.txt> I use Opera. It comes with some basic ad blocker, built in. It's far from a good browser, it's just what I've always used and I'm too lazy to switch.  It's probably the same with most browsers on Windows, unless you harden them through settings and extensions.
2023-02-04T17:53:19Z	(#bfbchba) It's absolutely laughable, how some people see Russia as a free-speech utopia. I'm sure those thrown in jail, for as little as suggesting, that what Russia is doing to Ukraine, might be a war, are really glad, to live in such a free country.  Even when it comes to hosting, you get more restrictions, than you do in the US (or the before mentioned Ukraine), unless your controversial thing, is either convenient for their government, or you're willing to play ball.
2023-02-04T18:58:13Z	(#kthy2ya) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I'm not trying to be hostile, or spread misinformation. I was there, on the Fediverse, back when it happened. If anyone wants more information about this part of Fediverse history, they can watch this short video about it: https://youtu.be/yZoASOyfvGQ   Even this video is in favor of this kind of instance-based moderation and so am I - to some, but much lesser extent. There are instances, that unfortunately became the home of mostly pedophiles or animal abusers and I'm sure no-one else, wants to see that, unless "that" means seeing these kinds of people in jail.  What I have a problem with, is circulating blocklists, including many instances, because of some political ideology or offensive/dark sense of humor - or worst case scenario, the actions of only few of its members.  An ideal implementation of the Fediverse, would in my opinion, warn users, when they're about to interact with one of these instances, but still give them the options, to accept the risks and go forward with it.  I think this decision being left purely to instance administrators, can in some cases further the divide, between groups and opinions and lead to more extreme versions of those opinions eventually.  We can argue about the other topics too, but that's probably less important, as I'll always be of the opinion, that when it comes to humor, anything (me included) can be a target - to the point where I even think it's ok, to make fun of tragedies, as soon as they happened, even if I usually don't do that myself.  The sanitization only applies to some sites, like YouTube - removing the dislike button and making their rules way stricter, when it comes to some topics. There are other examples, but I don't want to make this textwall infinite, so I'll let go of this, for now.  Lastly and probably most importantly, it was pretty stupid of me, to add these other frustrations of mine, onto this thread about transphobia. Even if we disagree about what is, or isn't too far, when it comes to humor, I'm obviously in favor, of keeping this place free of any kind of discrimination.

2023-02-16T09:55:53Z	(#vctjd6a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I got an ad, for this strange site, that claims to be the only way, to invest in parts of some famous paintings.  I decided, to check it out, because it presents more questions, than it does answers, like if and how do they even own them. It's also been advertised for quite some time, yet it tries to look, like some hot new thing, you have to be invited to join.   Can't really say, how much of a scam it is, but the fact some of the paintings listed have their image links broken now, doesn't add much credibility - not like the site itself had any, to begin with.

2023-02-21T16:15:16Z	(#2p5jzrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm pretty sure it's still possible to mass-register accounts, through some tempmail services. - It just makes doing so harder.  In this case, despite hating captchas, they still seem like a best solution to this. Especially if there's still ones, that'd work, while being well made, not too annoying and made with accessibility in mind. 🤔
2023-02-21T17:36:00Z	(#2p5jzrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, this is probably the best option, especially if the e-mail isn't kept anywhere, after the verification.

2023-02-26T00:20:19Z	(#2byqfha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you. The reference is really obscure, to the point that no-one, in any of the places I posted it to, guessed it. Excluding the place, where I found about the thing from myself - but one can hardly count that as a guess. 😂   So I guess, I might as well say it. It's Alex Eagleston, one of the most unlikable video-game protagonists, from the game "YIIK: A Post-Modern RPG". A game, that most would agree, isn't very good either.
2023-02-27T21:42:47Z	(#sfurppq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I kinda like the glass look it adds to the site. I also still have no idea, how CPU demanding such a thing is, so now you're making me wonder, if it's worth it. 🤔
2023-03-01T19:55:02Z	(#j7ukhba) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The people who wanted to rely on Visa, Mastercard or any other giant company with already too much control over peoples finances and ability to do business, completely missed the whole point of crypto, to begin with.  Or at least the point, that sadly became secondary, to "extracting money from gullible idiots, to overall benefit the already wealthy".
2023-03-01T21:00:18Z	(#3nq6dla) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I fully understand Mastercards and Visas decision on this. I'm just saying, that the people invested in crypto, who want it to become mainstream, shouldn't forget, that the main reason it got popular, was people wanting a financial system, that governments and big companies wouldn't be able to monitor, rule over, manipulate or ban anyone from. So why do some of them cry, over these big companies like Visa or Mastercard, not wanting to be involved now?  There were even those, who tried pushing crypto, as one of the main currencies in their countries - and that just ain't it either. Just look at what happen to El Salvador, after they tried doing this, with Bitcoin.  These things might sound nice on paper, to cryptobros and holders, but I think they go against, what crypto was meant to be.

2023-03-14T18:50:03Z	My hot take, adding to the banks vs crypto debate, happening here:  While banks in most countries, can be trusted, what I find more alarming, is there being only two companies (MaserCard a Visa), who handle international money transfers - both having ToS, that allow them to blacklist you, without even giving you the reason, why that decision was made. They are also both ran out of the same country.  I'm not saying crypto is the solution, competition is! Anything even close to a monopoly, in any field, should make people worried. There should also be no second chances, for the companies, institutions, or governments, cough mishandling peoples money.   PayPal withheld funds for unreasonably long and charged illegal and unjustifiable random fines, that earned them a class action lawsuit. No-one should do business, with a company this scummy and I immediately demanded, that they delete my account, when I found out this was happening.  Lastly, say what you will, about the protests of Canadian truckers. I don't fully endorse, what they did (both sides made mistakes, in this conflict), but if my government withheld money, from anyone, over protests, I'd definitely not feel safe, knowing people like that, can touch all my money.

2023-04-03T16:39:17Z	To my surprise, some AI companies, might have to face the consequences of their art theft afterall. While the legal and corporate world, still couldn't give less of a shit about the small artists, stability ai made the critical mistake, of using the ever so precious bland and generic stock images. Those are owned by companies, who for obvious reasons, hate AI, have extremely deep pockets and access to the right kind of lawyers.  They also have one other key advantage, that could win them the case. By slapping their watermark on millions of images, in the exact same place, the AI will start putting distorted versions of it, onto some images. Therefore, they can argue damage to their reputation, with evidence, to back it up.   https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66788385/getty-images-us-inc-v-stability-ai-inc/

Sadly most of those servers were either too obscure, broken, or not obscure enough, to avoid Disneys lawyers.  I was mildly excited, when I heard about a 3D sequel, made by some of the people, behind the original game (before Disney bought it), but this is suspicious at best.  Even if you made the funny penguin game from my childhood, I will not give you my social security number, nor my credit card info, to play the new one and I hope not many others will either.  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/WrNfAejwYSuTVvBuJZMdiG.png)  *The sequel is called "Party Parrot World" and requires a "verified Hideaway account", if you want to play it, or try some other two game things, that they are currently working on.

2023-04-26T14:24:25Z	(#pg5dg7q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Hard to say when exactly the downfall started, but there were many strange moments, in the last few years. There was the new ownership, some developers jumping ship and starting Vivaldi Browser, the whole company getting caught, for offering predatory loans, to Android users in poorer countries, in 2020 (https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-19-opera-accused-of-predatory-loan-apps.html),...  But at last, they found some success, with their gimmicky Opera GX "gaming browser", they still pay youtubers to promote and I guess the promoted content within.  They also came up with a free VPN integration, that they later monetized and started taking pretty much every partner, willing to pay them, to get integrated into their main browser - an offer most appealing to small crypto/web 3.0 projects, trying to appear more promising, by having a browser company on board.
2023-04-26T19:25:28Z	(#ujrsmkq) Sure, it's still not exactly ethical and probably not even legal, in some cases, but at the end of the day, it's at the very least something.   Something, that makes me think, that there could have been a scenario, where it was a voluntary community project, developers would gladly contribute some of their code and advise to - like some of them are already doing elsewhere.  Even with "art generation", if credit was properly given and the thing showed all the artists, the final peace was inspired by and where to find and support them, it might have had a way warmer welcome.
2023-04-29T20:46:25Z	(#645gw7a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I've looked into it myself and funnily enough, the best take might have been some random comment, saying it's only popular, because it's invite only and people are having trouble getting in.  Further, as there are not many actual users, people seem to be projecting all of their hopes and dreams onto it, while waiting in the endless joining line, or falling for "pay for invite" scams. Yes, those somehow exist and cost anywhere from 20 to 100$ - no refunds.

I'd be really surprised, if the instances, willing to host illegal content, weren't somehow blocked by default.  Even the sites hosting gore and archiving illegal shooting cams, always have an effective way to remove illegal pornography. If anyone made a site without that option, no-one would ever want to host it and the only users happy to stay on it, would be pedophiles.  There are a few Mastodon instances like that, made by and for pedophiles, hosted in places with loose laws, but they're completely defederated, even from those ran by "free speech absolutists", as well as the few, straigh up advocating neo-nazism.

2023-06-23T23:11:05Z	Opera browser: my final disavowal   While the Internet is being flooded by a record amount of Opera ads, affiliate program members and new hardcore defenders, while I - as someone, who has been using it without a break, for more than 10 years, have had enough and I've finally decided to uninstall it.  Part of the reason for this decision, was the new Opera One UI update, that I not only found incredibly ugly and uninspired, but also worsening the already abysmal performance of the browser, as well as adding to the already gigantic pile of bugs within.  All of this, came after a few very frustrating weeks, where the browser constantly crashed, under the weight of its own AI bloat. Every time any text was selected, it was trying to load some ridiculous AI integrations on top, but always crashing and loosing all the opened tabs. After the UI update, the whole browser somehow felt even more wonky and laggy.  Even for those, who might be fans of the new UI and all the added "features", that now include a built in generic anime girl game and stupid cartoon noises, upon clicking almost anything, in the "gaming version" of this browser, the growing concerns about this browsers spyware-like connections, to all kinds of mysterious servers, should at least be considered and looked into further. Not to mention the extra problems, that come with them being a Chinese-ran company, storing this data in China. Quick summary: https://youtu.be/NV8akIgfDqQ  Int the interest of brevity, I won't go further into the pointless social media arguments they engage in, their past promoting predatory loans, them inserting affiliate links (to the sites you visit through tiles), running a very questionable free VPN service, hidden extensions, that cannot be removed and god knows what else.  Either way Opera, you were an alright browser - many, many years ago. Sadly all I can say now, is "rest in piss, you won't ever be missed!".  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/aTJEDSG3XMVGRJjSKrwYvL.png)

What Opera does now (among other things), is sponsor creators/"influencers" to talk about it, pays to show up, on top of browser-related Google searches and occupies the tiny amount of ad space, that I do not block, to help cover some projects server costs. But to be transparent, some of that is surely targeted at me, only because I was researching it - and the Google spyware somehow noticed.  Now I want to give Pulse browser a fair try. It's still in alfa, but it's one of the few forks of Firefox, that try to change and simplify things, offer a bit of a unique look and it comes with Ublock origin built-in.

2023-07-25T07:58:07Z	(#5gmpt7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Twitter has ditched the bird logo, in favor of the uni code character "𝕏".  The company behind it is now called "X Corp." and the site can also be accessed, by going to https://x.com .  Once the rebrand is finished, the site will just be called "X", with "the everything app" as the new tagline/slogan.  Dumb (but related) shitpost, made by me: https://youtube.com/shorts/GxeYI7ZBdk4?feature=share

2023-07-27T08:14:26Z	(#4sbpj2q) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Depends on what you're looking for. If you want something a little bigger, but still very pixelated and don't mind it only supporting English. You can take the one used on my site( https://thecanine.ueuo.com )  You should keep in mind, that it's more or less ripped from "Hypnospace Outlaw", so probably not good for commercial use.  A smaller, most languages supporting and more commercially usable pixelfont is "uni05_53" by Craig Kroeger. Sadly the version of this font, listed on the vast majority (if not all) font sites, includes a small error, that makes it unusable, for some European languages.  A fix for that was made by me, after getting Craigs permission, so if you like this font, it's better to download my version of it, from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vEXYneABo6tAXdz2e0Er915uiiP5aFh-/
2023-07-27T22:01:09Z	(#4sbpj2q) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> That one is also nice, but not all too pixely. Don't even know if I'd consider it a pixelated font, rather than just a "low resolution looking" one. 🤔
2023-07-27T22:27:07Z	If anyone remembers my rant, about the strange Club Penguin sequel, that requested very personal information and documents for verification - it somehow got even stranger. I got a couple more e-mails from them, trying to get me to finish my registration, before I set my spam filter, to get rid of future reminders.  For some reason completely beyond my understanding, after a few months passed, their system just automatically assumed that I went through with it and sent me the following e-mail, congratulating me for doing so:  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/pSgMAzRsHbpFuMyhxj3kD4.png)  Sure enough, this is not just a "rogue mail server" and my account just somehow works now, without any of the requested info.  I off-course did the responsible thing, clicked the big yellow button and downloaded the apk file onto my primary phone, installed it and gave it the requested permission, to install other things. It installed the promised Club Penguin sequel "Party Parrot World", that still despite being a separate thing, could only be launched through the original app, that was called "Hideaway".  To cut it "short", it is a "technically functional multiplayer game", in the loosest definition of all those words. It barely even loads and clicking almost anything breaks it. I have only seen a glimpse of one other player for a second, so I'm not even sure, it wasn't some NPC, missplaced there by one of the many present bugs. Lastly there just wasn't anything to do, besides walking around, going through the buggy menu, that usually broke the "game", so much it had to be relaunched, or trying to find "minigames", that either said coming soon, or were not playable on mobile.  I might still return to this thing down the line, out of pure curiosity, but a masterpiece it is not.
2023-07-28T07:12:39Z	(#4sbpj2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That is unfortunate, but it probably applies to all heavily pixelated fonts, so if you're aiming for that aesthetic, you don't have a more accessible choice.  I only use those fonts on my website, where this issue can be mitigated, by turning off external fonts (in the browser settings), or using a screen reader.  This is not a perfect solution, but knowing that, I try to keep screen reader compatibility a high priority, during site rewrites. Along with making sure, the site looks alright, with the usual default browser fonts.
2023-07-28T18:40:13Z	(#4sbpj2q) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> You're the first person, to ever tell me that. I was testing the last minor rewrite, along with my friend from US, who had no trouble accessing it and all of my US VPN IPs connect too.  After the recent move, the site is now most likely hosted in the DFW Datacenter, located within the US. That's not anything new either, as despite being European, I think the vast majority of my stuff, runs somewhere on your continent.  If this isn't just some temporary outage, you might have to contact your ISP and demand a working service. I'm still checking here, but it doesn't look like there's any problems on my end.

2023-08-12T18:38:10Z	I just got the Windows 11 update, that adds the new folders, volume bar design and some other "features". I don't even know how many people have it now, or what kind of an update it was, but I thought it looked alright and didn't mind it, until Microsoft tried to sneak all the bloatware I spent a day+ removing back in, through some background process, I luckily noticed and quickly destroyed.
2023-08-21T14:10:50Z	(#5x4xrdq) Yes, disabling any and all notifications and sounds is an absolute must.   The Discord app itself used to be at least usable, long before all their stupid redesigns, rewrites, additions no-one asked for and new monetization gimmicks.  >DEATH TO INCOMPETENT REACT REWRITES  Well I might be partly biased, because it is the platform, where I'm by far the most popular and one where my bot development and art started. They even reserved "@thecanine" for me.   Still all I wish them is the Skype future and most users moving to better alternatives, like Revolt.chat.
2023-08-21T16:10:37Z	(#aex52eq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I really don't think so, as even Googles attempts to filter out content inappropriate for children failed miserably. As far as I know, the only front-end that even comes anywhere close to your requirements is Invideous, but unless you're willing to give up child filers and see some trending, you'd probably have to fork it and change quite a few things.
2023-08-30T14:26:54Z	(#xevmcwa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Looks like yet another one of those scams, where a custom version of Chat GPT (machine learning at best, in no way even close to real AI), is shoved into a human-shaped torso and presented as FutureBot5000.  Still kinda sad how guy 1, had to invent a woman shaped and voiced android, to have something resembling a woman, he can yell "shut up" at. 😂
2023-08-31T22:57:00Z	Oh god, If I don't repent for my sins and end up in hell - I'm pretty sure part of my punishment will be having to watch the Discord soydevs, attempt to program an Android file picker in RN, for all of eternity - as it will never be accomplished. All while I scream at them in pure agony, far greater than the one caused by my skin melting in lava.  You have to have a photo (cannot be an image, even if the extension is the same) in a specific directory, taken by the phones camera, for this file picker to function. How is code this bad even possible, unless it's on purpose.

2023-09-21T20:39:42Z	(#jzzukua) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I'm never too serious about code theft, because as developers, we all do a little copying and pasting from SO, or smashing the keyboard, until the code works somehow. Despite that, it's still bullshit, that this was targeting all the open-source developers, who did not consent and probably also violating all kinds of open-source licenses in the process, yet at the end, it's the proprietary developers and companies, who profit the most from it, despite contributing nothing, or the bare minimum.

2023-09-27T18:50:48Z	There is not many designers I follow and even less, who I follow ironically. One of them is Peter Arnell, the guy I "admire", for being able to create stupid shit, write even stupider explanations and sell it to companies, for tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars.  In 2008, his group designed the very logo, that Pepsi used until now and justified its greatness,  by 27 pages of the dumbest shit ever put on paper, that I sometimes quote to this day. Sadly all great things, must come to an end.After 15 years of small changes, Pepsi decided, to get rid of the logo completely, along with making their garbage drink, even more unhealthy and pushing the allegedly cancer causing sugar-free version.   I will never have a proper Arnell logo for myself, along with the book of nonsense, that you get with one - especially not after writing this and considering, I probably won't make that much money, during my entire life. Still in the spirit of great graphical genius Peter Arnell, I humbly submit one sketch of my current logo, with added nonsense, that completely fails to rival his.   ![](https://twtxt.net/media/KzqJsLhx9iRa8ZFY78DfPS.png)  If you have any logos, or want to try doing this, with anything I ever drew, please do it now and send me the results - might the spirit of the Arnell design process, never die!

2024-01-22T18:58:01Z	Those of you who have your own sites, might want to give this a quick look: https://spawning.ai/ai-txt  It's just a text file, similar to robots.txt, but for AI crawlers, rather than search engine ones. Probably not very effective, as of now, but at least it's a way to make it clear you don't conset to your site being used for AI training, without making it suck for human users, in the process.
2024-01-23T08:30:09Z	(#fucv4ya) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yes, I agree the website itself sucks and the company behind it is incompetent at best - even more so, with their other websites.  Their first site (haveibeentrained.com) was offering a way to search through all the training datasets, not realizing, they were full of illegal porn - so it was quickly shut down.  Now their main gimmick is offering a browser extension, that lets you see what data on any given site you visit, was used for AI training, what has already been marked as "opted out" and a way to add your stuff, to that list.  I don't like that idea either, adding URLs to a list, should not require questionable browser extensions and in general, opting out all the places that might have your images, doesn't seem worth the time, if the companies, don't even have to respect this request.  If you just want the txt file, without additional nonsense, feel free to take the default one, that I use here: https://thecanine.ueuo.com/ai.txt and use or edit it, to match your needs.
2024-01-24T14:30:16Z	(#fucv4ya) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> their crawler does not read the robots txt and to my knowledge, neither do any other AI crawlers. As always, they considered themselves exempt, from everything they find inconvenient.

2024-02-14T10:18:49Z	People who fight against the use of privacy frontends and bridges, to relay publicly available information, should be mocked for their stupidity. This applies to both salty Twitter bros/YouTubers, fighting it, because they feel entitled to pennies from advertisers and Fediblock jannies, deathly afraid someone using another protocol and a bridge, might read their shit takes and be able to add their opinion, into the discussion.  I'm not in favor of scraping content and/or profiting from it, but that's something completely different. Especially when it comes to frontends, you're not entitled to an opt-out - that's not how that technology works.

2024-03-13T12:42:20Z	(#xcuabvq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The best part is, that since it is the business version of Teams, they still have to give you the option, to opt-out of this update. To do so, you just have to: 1) Agree to this nonsense and let the app update itself 2) Click around the new version for a bit 3) Click your profile picture in the top right corner 4) Uncheck the "use new version" thingy 5) Confirm your choice 6) Let the app downgrade itself
2024-03-13T13:17:05Z	(#xcuabvq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Idk, it's gotten to a point, where there is probably 3 or 4 completely different versions of MS Teams. I was on thr Windows version 1.7.00.3653, when the pop-up appeared and now after forcing the downgrade, I'm back on that version again.  The reason, why I demand to be able to continue using this version, is because the one they're trying to force onto everyone, is not only still janky, but also missing crucial features. Part of my job, is being able to quickly communicate things, in multiple languages. The old version supports that, because it can figure out the language you're currently using and automatically check the spelling for that language. The new version, only lets you choose one language and does not even support the language, that I use the most. I could probably get the support for that language working, but it would require admins to install language packs, to every machine I use and me going through the settings, every time I need it, to spellcheck the other language.
