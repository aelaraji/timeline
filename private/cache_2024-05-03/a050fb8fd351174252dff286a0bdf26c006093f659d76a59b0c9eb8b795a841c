2021-01-17T12:41:57Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<hcbm5ya https://twtxt.net/search?tag=hcbm5ya>) is there any PHP paser and posting UI for twtxt yet?
2021-01-17T13:02:16Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<hcbm5ya https://twtxt.net/search?tag=hcbm5ya>) because then i could add twtxt to my websites CMS (yellow by datenstrom.se).  But I guess it would be fairy simple to code something myself.
2021-01-17T13:32:42Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<hcbm5ya https://twtxt.net/search?tag=hcbm5ya>) Thank you for the xplanation. what tools beside twtxt.net do you know that can precent the content of twtxt.txt in nice ways? like showing images and making links clickable?
2021-01-17T19:50:25Z	@sørenpeter (#<hzj5gyq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=hzj5gyq>) selv hej!
2021-01-18T10:01:22Z	(#<hcbm5ya https://twtxt.net/search?tag=hcbm5ya>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> , @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> got it right. i have already build my webpage using yellow. What im after is a easy way to render my twtxt.txt in a similar way to what it is done here on twtxt.net plus an easy way to use the online editor in yellow to post updates to my  twtxt.txt, mainly justin adding the date and time(zone).  I kinda fixed the render part using the [tickler extension for yellow](https://github.com/schulle4u/yellow-extensions-schulle4u/tree/master/ticker). But there is still some cleaning up to do as you can see at:  http://www.darch.dk/notes/
2021-01-18T12:02:27Z	(#<hcbm5ya https://twtxt.net/search?tag=hcbm5ya>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Yes i have noticed you sitegen. It looks cool:) But i don't have shell access to my webhosting. And I don't feel like re-redoing my website once again. And there is something old-school about php that I like.  I got the render cleaned up a bit: http://www.darch.dk/edit/notes/ - now i just need a way to feed in my selfhosted twtxt.txt and posting to it. For now I can use this awesome pod ;)
2021-01-18T12:04:17Z	(#<hcbm5ya https://twtxt.net/search?tag=hcbm5ya>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you, Adi. yeah nothing beast a bash from the past:P

But I put the "T" back after testing it and found that it did not work with twtxt.net  ;)

Now at least my closest family got onto signal, which is at least a step up from Facebook messenger.
2021-01-25T14:53:16Z	(#<vudccta https://twtxt.net/search?tag=vudccta>) @<thewismit https://blog.thewismit.com/user/thewismit/twtxt.txt> Matrix also looks very promising, but it might be trying to do too many things at once. The same goes for Scuttlebutt (www.ssb.nz), I like the ideas behind but the implementations are too hacky for normal users. Scuttlebutt definitely has it merits in not relaying  on central servers and that it can work in areas without internet, just p2p, even in a jungle or at sea. That why I like the scope of twtxt and twt/yarn.social together with delta.chat.

Also the DM feature seems superfluous. For me the scope of the twtxt-ecosytem is a way to make publish post and have discussions in the open. There are plenty of DM/IM and blog services/system out there, and it should be up to each person to chose which of these they want to use instead of having another inbox to keep an eye on.
2021-01-29T12:51:22Z	(#<vevdhna https://twtxt.net/search?tag=vevdhna>) You can change the color of the pin using css.  I like the heart, but a [star](https://viglino.github.io/iconicss/?icon=star&page=icons), [bookmark](https://viglino.github.io/iconicss/?icon=book-bookmark&page=icons) or [floppy](https://viglino.github.io/iconicss/?icon=floppy&page=icons) could also work.

It is not about making the codebase more lean, but about making the core feature stand out. And insisting on the simplicity. Like you said no to polls. If you need polls you make a twt with a link to doodle.com or similar. It would still be good to have a way of knowing how to contact people directly. You can use the tagline for a the contact info you feel comfortable to sharing. Removing DM will also remove the potential issues of harassment and spam, that this channel could be used for.

It would be a lot lighter than what the indiewebbers are doing. And it could be a blog hosted on your pod or elsewhere. The important thing is to give the user and/or admin options to chose the features the would like to use or not.

2021-02-13T11:02:48Z	A way to integrate twtxt/yarn/rss/atom into the base of how the web works, could be to create a feature like `mailto:` called `follow:` or `feed:` so you can just click on any link and your browser will add it to your feed reader of choice like it does with your e-mail client. A start could be a feed-plugin for the main browsers. **Edit:** It looks `feed:` already kind is/was a thing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_URI_scheme

Planetary i think is somewhat separated. But then again Scuttlebutt is struggling with access the same profile from several devices, since it is peer2peer first, where all users are running a server on their own device and moving this server can break then crypto-threading that is the backbone of the SSB protocol. Feedless is offering a hosted solution at their server, but you can also selfhost on your own devic

I want to be able to edit or at least delete posts and not just my last post. And this will be a dealbreaker if we are to bring more people to using twtxt via hosted yarn-server.

And I know it is a matter of saving resources, but it kinda weird to not being able to search back in time more than X amount of time. In a way this is just adding a "blackbox" algorithm to yarn/twt that is not logical for regular end-users compared to other systems. If you use any other client than twt.social, then you will be able to read the whole timeline in their interface.

The link to your Music feed on https://www.gr0k.net/links.html seem to go to the blog feed instead. Also for a way to keep you /twtxt page up to date you can take a look at https://0xff.nu/picoblog or ask around here on twtxt.net where others have also made similar setups.

I was just thinking this morning to base a new color scheme on Ubuntu, because they already do something nice with purple - this is a bit too dark though: https://github.com/guneysus/gohugo-hacker/blob/master/images/ubuntu.png For Yarn.social i would not use a monospace font.

2021-03-09T17:46:35Z	I made some concepts/mockups rethinking the navigation for yarn.social. And trying out a permanent sidebar, but not sure if it is needed... Details in a PDF at [github](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/issues/396#issuecomment-794219538)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/h5D4minZSVYc67XUQC7zPn)  Feedback here or at github is more than welcome :)

I just tried out two different way of cleaning up the levels of navigation, hiding (1-2 clicks) some that in my experiences would not be needed that often and bumping some up (direct access).
2021-03-09T19:13:27Z	(#<jatw6pq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jatw6pq>) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Doh! Kinda exposing an issue that I was  trying to address the the now gone post... Anyhow I recommend people to give this a read https://herman.bearblog.dev/mvp-vs-slc/ on Minimum Viable Product vs Simple, Loveable, and Complete. I think we should focus on fixing stuff that would turn regular users off and putting features that are only half-working on the backburner/someday-maybe-list, ie. private messages.

2021-03-10T06:36:42Z	(#<jatw6pq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=jatw6pq>) how about a drop-down sidebar only using CSS, as a way to combining the two layout? no hover, only click of course. https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_dropdowns.asp

2021-03-10T17:09:11Z	(#<a4uhsdq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=a4uhsdq>) I'm glad that voicemail it not really a thing anymore and a have it turned off from my phone carrier. Most voice messages are just pocket calls or people who did not manage to hand up before the beep. And there is more open and interoperable alternatives to the silo systems such as matrix.org, delta.chat and twtxt/yarn.social. Sadly most people are not willing to pay for these service just yet. The fee for these services could be via your ISP or phone carrier or governments might realize that these are vital part of our infrastructure and provide services funding by tax

Been busy with organising live gigs and learning to code GLSL shaders. But I think I can get back to it next week. I had an idea for a white paper (I think that is what you call it) on the potentials for how twtxt/yarn can replace the silo social medias. It could go along with the manifesto.

But you can't have `:` in filenames and I'm building an instagram-ish view for twtxt when i want an easy way to link back to the original post.
2021-06-12T09:49:06Z	@<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> (#<xz5owka https://twtxt.net/search?tag=xz5owka>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what the the secrecy code you use for like breaks in posts?

2021-06-13T20:34:48Z	@<anth http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt#anth> (#<nj3rtxa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=nj3rtxa>) just tried on my main disk in my macbook. did not work. I'm more concerned with not confusing the end user and securing cross platform complability that what might be allowed in some OSs.
2021-06-13T20:37:53Z	@<anth http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt#anth> (#<nj3rtxa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=nj3rtxa>) I would like to prefix uploaded media files via my twtxt webclient with the datetime so the can easly be viewed in a chronological gallery and linking back the original yet with just a simple grep
2021-06-14T07:37:50Z	(#<nj3rtxa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=nj3rtxa>) Will try to explain at a later time. but unix time might be a solution.

2021-06-16T06:22:40Z	(#<nj3rtxa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=nj3rtxa>) Yup... I should be public now

2021-06-26T19:34:56Z	@<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> (#<knln7ba https://twtxt.net/search?tag=knln7ba>) how does the use of tabs in this message work in other clients? I want to use some kind of code for replacing with `<p>` or `<br>` in my render at http://darch.dk/twtxt/ using #<picoblog https://twtxt.net/search?tag=picoblog> and darch.dk/twtxt/gallery.php - so far i tried `>>` , `//` and `tabs`

I had a look at cabal.chat yesterday that seem to have something like this going for it, but it was still very buggy.
2021-06-27T10:38:56Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> did you get my email earlier this week about GitHub for UI/UX?

2021-07-08T10:51:54Z	(#<moogcia https://twtxt.net/search?tag=moogcia>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes, I'm aware that a relationship can be established when A (@darch) fetches the feed from B (@sorenpeter). Bu there is nothing anywhere online that can tell you that B follows or fetches A. I don't have a client as such for @<sorenpeter http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt> except my interface for posting to http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt and a local instance of the original twtxt client on my macbook, that i have not run for over 6 months.

2021-08-02T07:40:25Z	(#<xdi6txa https://twtxt.net/search?tag=xdi6txa>) I had similar ideas for re-labeling stuff in the new UI. But TBH I don't know when I will be able to get around to work on it..
2021-08-03T09:42:49Z	(#<nc6duqq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=nc6duqq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> I've been opposing adding DM/chat to yarn, because there already are sooo many chat services out there, so no need to reinvent the wheel. Also having to stay on top of yet another inbox is something i would like to avoid. Though if we can come up with some way of relaying/forwarding the DMs to whatever service you prefer, like just sending a email to the users existing account seem like a good option or to build in support for delta.chat that just uses email for chat.
2021-08-19T08:46:25Z	(#<na6mqjq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=na6mqjq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I like how clean and compact it is:) It is a bit confusing to see where the Replay/Conversations/tag line belongs - is it to the post above or below. so maybe move the <hr> line below the post instead of just under the content of the post. There are 100 other ways to make it look nice, that we can explore, like this one: http://darch.dk/yarn-hack/Mockup_to_Code/
2021-08-20T19:07:17Z	(#<na6mqjq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=na6mqjq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> i like the idea about plugins for all the extra features beside basic twtxt'ing/yarn'ing :) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I take that as a compliment;) is there a live link to you minimalist yarn server?
2021-08-23T13:06:03Z	(#<qcq7rrq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=qcq7rrq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I would like to see some basic features rolled out before inventing new stuff. Like getting a search engine up and running, so we can build filtering features for improving the UI and UX. Also the flow/speed of conversation (the social act, not the yarn-feature) on twtxt vs. IRC is radically different. IRC is ephemeral chatting and twtxt is microbloging at its cores.
2021-08-24T07:20:49Z	(#<qcq7rrq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=qcq7rrq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> You are welcome :)
2021-08-24T07:47:45Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I just created `twitter://twitter.com/gtdguy` on feeds.twtxt.net but i can't figure out how to start following this feed. When i got to https://twtxt.net/feeds all i see is this: ![](https://twtxt.net/media/MCmP7yHPZGAdGUAG7tFmSf) and on https://feeds.twtxt.net/feeds it does not show up
2021-08-24T13:06:25Z	(#<h2iljvq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=h2iljvq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> i added it as `twitter://twitter.com/gtdguy` - should it just be `twitter://gtdguy` ? And yes it might be because there is no recent posts, but then i would be nice if it just pulled the latest 5 posts or so. I wanna try if i can use twtxt as RSS/atom reader along with twitter frontend. And I also got some ideas for simplifying the "Add feed"-workflow for the normal users.
2021-08-24T13:18:14Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#<h2iljvq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=h2iljvq>) https://feeds.twtxt.net/twitter-gtdguy/twtxt.txt is there now :) It would be nice if yarn/twtxt.net could render older post and you are not forced to read the raw twtxt.txt file if you are a bit late to the party;)
2021-08-24T13:38:34Z	(#<h2iljvq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=h2iljvq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> cool.

2021-08-24T18:55:32Z	(#<h2iljvq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=h2iljvq>) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> an API for pulling in twitter avatar? why not just use the URL since you already got the handle?
2021-08-24T18:58:28Z	(#<h2iljvq https://twtxt.net/search?tag=h2iljvq>) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> made an issue now: https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/rss2twtxt/issues/13

So the server will not store info about if you read a post or not, just showing how long ago the latest post was made. I made mockup back in the spring showcase this: http://darch.dk/yarn-hack/Mockup_to_Code/

I think we had a discussion with more option on github where i made some other variation on the mockup.

The idea is that you do not need to check/click on each feed if you know you read all you mention if it say 2h and you checked just 1h ago. And in this way I imagine this will be less additive than how it work now. And we also does not need to log if a user read/viewed a post or not like in red-badge notifications. I hope this makes sense otherwise I would be up for video call Sunday after 16 CEST

2021-10-10T16:31:41Z	(#ky26ivq) I like it as a way to discover users on other pods, but will it be toggleable? in this way you can use a specific pod for a specific topic and new people can get a idea of this is the right pod for them
2021-10-10T16:33:01Z	(#ky26ivq) I have also been thinking to rename "Discover" in the UI to "Explore"
2021-10-10T17:07:22Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> is there a way to reuse the pod name and description in the Logo?  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/zJ64TQPCNmfF8B2gmDvR3G)
2021-10-11T07:56:00Z	(#fnav4ma) Is there a `{{ $pod-name }}` and `{{ $pod-desciption }}` that can be used in the logo-code-field?
2021-10-11T07:57:35Z	(#32ioxha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I would like to make some graphic for the play-store, but this week I'm on vacation, so if anyone wanna do it please don't hesitate

2021-10-13T07:14:20Z	(#5ossspa) I like that the last one is not all caps, but prefer the font in 3th and yes the gradient is nice too
2021-10-13T08:10:38Z	(#4on6u2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> nope, i didn't know what file from https://files.mills.io/ui/ to install
2021-10-13T08:16:22Z	(#5ossspa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> to me that would make the logo too busy and hard to read. we could use the yarn-ball as the dot. How did you make these logos?
2021-10-13T13:28:38Z	(#5ossspa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> nice, a lot of good ideas/inspiration
2021-10-14T07:39:56Z	(#3tlepcq) So some way of a UI elements across pod that will routhe the action back to your preferred pod?

2021-10-20T07:40:46Z	(#ctdtuta) For a more compact look I would place the text next to the yarn-ball instead of over and under - this is made in mspaint.exe, so no SVG yet... ![](https://twtxt.net/media/YBnJY29jn45CDwYMBS2arY)

The yarn logo and other icons are from openmoji, so I can't take credit for that. I still need some help with implementing some of the hinted at functionalities that are not in the old design.
2021-10-21T04:24:35Z	(#ctdtuta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thanks🙂 and yes adding the time ago for timeline and mentions in the topnenu and the in-reply-to for each reply would be great. But we can role this new design out without it if needed. I need to finished rebuilding the CSS for all the subpages as well. I have decided to not base it on one specific CSS template, but to patch it together for different ones alongside my own code. This way we can also make sure it it is easier to customize for pod owners.
2021-10-21T04:27:04Z	(#ctdtuta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> also I used the pod name var in this logo, but the pod description is hardcodes right now

2021-10-21T22:42:58Z	(#icngulq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I have an idea to just skip the nick-field under /follow and only show it if no nick is found.  An expansion of this is to integrate it with rss2twtxt (can't remember the new name), so you will just have one field that you pop in an URL to and then it will resolve what kind of feed it is - be it twtxt.txt, rss/atom, twitter, youtube, etc.
2021-10-22T20:56:02Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what's with the red dots at the conversations links?! They kinda stresses me out since you can't get rid of them...

2021-10-26T16:24:48Z	(#co5hwpq) Also we need to headlines indicating what view you are one. Right now i belive we only got it for conversations/yarns. That would be: - Discovery (POD or GLOBAL timeline) - USER Timeline - USER Metions - Bookmarks for USER - Conversation/Yarn - other lists?

2021-10-28T16:06:47Z	(#zsblufa) Gotcha, my idea was only to provide announcement about the events. All the rspv data should not be part of the yarn/twtxt ecosystem. I would link to something like gath.io or facebook events for this
2021-10-29T04:31:34Z	(#iaxmyuq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> i dont think we need a read status for Yarn. It would just add stress/angst like any kind of notification. I much prefer the stateless nature of how yarn works now.

2021-11-10T07:14:12Z	(#hfal6kq) it should be state cleary somewhere that you can always ask the podamin to manually remove a post from your twtxt.txt if needed. otherwise we might conflict with GDPR. it could be on a Getting started or FAQ page.

2021-11-11T05:03:15Z	(#hfal6kq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> 🎉 i will help you sorting out how to best place the new links for each post in the UI for best UX. It could also be in an edit timeline option under settings. What will the share do?
2021-11-11T05:26:57Z	(#mlakmda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> cool, got some CSS code for a dropdrop from my UI redesign that we can implement
2021-11-11T05:32:48Z	(#hzrblbq) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> you are welcome. Yes I also still need a timeline render. Found some PHP attempt if this on github, but nothing that I could get working. Keep me posted about your project 😊
2021-11-11T19:05:03Z	(#3w62djq) @<darch2 https://yarn.algorave.dk/user/darch2/twtxt.txt> well hello hello there "@me"
2021-11-11T19:08:22Z	(#3w62djq) hmm the hash is wrong compared to this: https://yarn.algorave.dk/twt/6otp3ka
2021-11-11T19:40:20Z	Thanks to @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> and @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> for the hacky help getting this running with `no.php`;) ![](https://twtxt.net/media/UeFx9mLgT8NH5edJjbmEej)
2021-11-11T20:11:34Z	(#3w62djq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> thanks, but i already got `-u https://yarn.algorave.dk` on...
2021-11-11T20:16:18Z	(#ojngxmq) will  this copy/pasted hash work from @<darch2 https://yarn.algorave.dk/user/darch2/twtxt.txt> ?
2021-11-11T20:41:32Z	(#ojngxmq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> it was fixed. The post was just from before the fix I guess
2021-11-11T20:48:50Z	(#hghxkca) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> thanks, just something I banged together😊
2021-11-11T20:51:26Z	(#ojngxmq) Thank you. I have also worked on it for the last 6 months or so. you can grap it from https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/themes/src/branch/master/copenhagen Stil WIP for some parts (see the readme;)
2021-11-11T21:36:19Z	(#hghxkca) On the yarn pod or www.algorave.dk ?
2021-11-11T21:52:12Z	(#7evtnvq) We were also talking about having a official yarn logo and not just some pseudorandom chipart of a yarn ball - is that something you would be wuff for?
2021-11-11T22:07:55Z	(#2abigoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thx, then we just need the rest of the yarnsphere to look just as nice😉
2021-11-12T05:49:31Z	(#ojngxmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> nope, yarn.algorave.dk was just set up for me to eat my own catfood in the work related to the UI and I might use it for the workshop that I will be doing here in December. So no need to follow, but you are welcome to just for testing stuff out
2021-11-12T06:11:09Z	(#d2uw2na) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> if you still need something to do today, you can take a look at the TODOs in my theme. I pushed it to the new themes repo yesterday
2021-11-12T07:07:44Z	(#3lkdtda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> nice one🚀🪄
2021-11-14T08:12:40Z	What happend to the twt-hashed that indicates this is a reply to another post? The numbers badge is not enough to help navigating the timeline and help desicde if you should open op a post to see it in context/conversation view
2021-11-14T08:40:16Z	(#wixssoa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> good to know it can be brought back😊 at least until we get `in-reply-to` preview working
2021-11-15T08:07:45Z	(#w76zd4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> A really good start :)
2021-11-15T08:12:15Z	(#w76zd4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I would use `small` over `em`, but i will try to style it in my copenhagen-theme sometime this week hopefully. Can you provide the avatar and date-time or time-ago as well? And maybe also render the markdown, not just show the plaintext:  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/gKUSCkaLJfVERcgvbNAy6C)
2021-11-15T08:30:27Z	(#w76zd4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What part sounds really hard?
2021-11-15T08:36:34Z	(#w76zd4q) hmm good questing if it's an image-only post, maybe just show the image icon like for non-whitelisted images links. or maybe we don't deal with these issues just yet😅
2021-11-15T08:51:35Z	(#w76zd4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> if the `<img>` is somewhere in the template I will take care of making it look right with my rad CSSkillz™ it could be hidden in a `<!-- -->`  for a start
2021-11-15T08:53:38Z	(#w76zd4q) Also there is no need to render the twt-context in conversation view ;)
2021-11-15T09:40:07Z	(#w76zd4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes i can look at the default theme as well:)
2021-11-15T17:09:00Z	(#w76zd4q) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Sorry don't really get your reasoning here...
2021-11-15T17:09:27Z	(#w76zd4q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> How do I activate the new twt-context on my own pod?
2021-11-15T17:16:26Z	(#w76zd4q) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Gracias!
2021-11-15T21:59:46Z	(#w76zd4q) It took a long time to do such a simple thing: https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/commit/242785c9eb8e2af5da4cfb17a1aa6b4c5f0fcb2f I really wanted to place the in-reply on the same line as post-time-ago+bookmark, but pico.css or some other omen would not let me (at least not tonight) (BONUS: I "fixed" the badge to not scream LOOOK AT ME! I'M A NOTIFICATION! ;)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/GYnu57uY3DAuxs8TuozyxD)
2021-11-16T05:46:00Z	(#65nlpdq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> sure thing. I actually made a new commit without that mess. Also I like the arrow and highlight of the author👌 but there seem to be too much space over the txt-context now - at least on mobil:  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/prUP3HXT95B5Rijq7CcnDK)
2021-11-16T05:53:42Z	(#lnfd42q) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> well I change it for a reason. To make it easier to read and to consistent with the other ways of showing numbers/context info like the time ago counters and down the like also "Follower/-ing (123)" Also the screen estate  is there to be used😉
2021-11-16T09:13:08Z	(#ursw63a) "Reply" will append to the ongoing conversation. "Fork" will make a new branch of the conversation. I have implemented a new way to render this, that I hope will make more sense in my [Copenhagen-theme](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/themes/src/branch/master/copenhagen). This it how it looks on [my test-pod](https://yarn.algorave.dk/conv/nzmpuzq) ![](https://twtxt.net/media/zaYUBBuHAPTYCxURcYvYmQ)
2021-11-16T09:27:56Z	(#ursw63a) and "Yarn" used to be called Conversation. I have also change that back in my design to be less patronizing to newcomers
2021-11-16T10:00:26Z	(#swx5eua) @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> well you just go grab it 😎 and maybe fix the broken parts😉
2021-11-16T13:20:31Z	(#swx5eua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I need help with the stuff in the [README](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/themes/src/branch/master/copenhagen)
2021-11-16T13:22:09Z	(#swx5eua) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> Well i know @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> is/was running his pod of a Rapsberry Pi, so it not that heavy to run
2021-11-16T14:13:52Z	(#swx5eua) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sure I can write you a more specific TODO :)
2021-11-16T14:28:40Z	(#ljd3q7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Maybe "patronizing"  is not the right word. But I do think that "Yarn" is too much slag compared to "Conversation" that everyone can understand.
2021-11-16T14:45:15Z	(#ljd3q7a) @<fastidious https://twtxt.net/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I use the mobile web version more than the app, but I have focus first on the Desktop in my work on my theme. Good thing I'm free to make my theme they way I see fit - and you yours:)

2021-11-18T05:22:45Z	(#meoufpq) Hey! I'm here and I consider myself a UI/UX developer 😬  I had similar ideas to make the timeline less messy by hiding reply-posts.  So let's try this idea. Maybe add the time ago for the latest reply. Also I think this should be separate from the normal timeline. Something like "collapsed timeline". Or the old render should be called "timeline with replies"

2021-11-18T06:54:48Z	(#meoufpq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is, but I do the webfrontend for the library's digital platforms
2021-11-18T08:03:25Z	(#meoufpq) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> I like the idea of some kind of toggle replies on/off just to try this feature out
2021-11-18T08:14:15Z	Should we have some kind of kanban-board for all our odd ideas of new yarn features?
2021-11-19T05:11:26Z	(#oe4juqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> i fixed this in my [Copenhagen theme](https://https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/themes/src/branch/master/copenhagen)  I posted some screenshots some time ago: https://twtxt.net/twt/knlqsca
2021-11-19T05:16:52Z	(#oe4juqq) @<deebs https://twtxt.net/user/deebs/twtxt.txt> that is exactly what I did in my [Copenhagen theme](https://https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/themes/src/branch/master/copenhagen)  I posted some screenshots some time ago: https://twtxt.net/twt/knlqsca
2021-11-19T05:42:04Z	(#oe4juqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes you can see it in the screenshot I linked to and try it out for yourself by running the theme
2021-11-19T05:45:54Z	(#oe4juqq) But for sure I do t think it's that much work we need to fix the last issues in my theme. Just been a busy week. I hope to have sone time this weekend

2021-11-20T14:14:16Z	Update to [my Copenhagen theme](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/themes/src/branch/master/copenhagen): - Fixed hard coded links in header to be dynamic - Add Mobile Styling, so it should work okay on smaller displays  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/PLLQZRg2jcNPFueFfXRwmS)  (still stuff todo...)

2021-11-22T10:39:06Z	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hi, will you whitelist twitter's media server `twimg.com` ?
2021-11-22T10:50:29Z	(#tpecvcq) To see inline images from artists I follow on twitter (via feeds.twtxt.net;) like: https://twtxt.net/external?uri=https%3a%2f%2ffeeds.twtxt.net%2ftwitter-zachlieberman%2ftwtxt.txt&nick=twitter-zachlieberman
2021-11-22T11:03:31Z	(#q7t7x4q) indeed. What is the deal with loading avatars from twitter?

2021-11-22T11:09:27Z	(#57zofgq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it is the new one that is not getting the right avatar, not the old ones...
2021-11-22T21:38:52Z	(#jojl34a) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> What is the issue? I have been converting my theme to use tabler-icons instead of openmoji tonight, which means I'm also very close at having a  working dark/light mode.

2021-11-23T13:30:43Z	(#pilsvtq) Looks good to me. Except the strike-through icon looks like a dick...

2021-11-23T14:18:05Z	(#2gb4f5a) we just need to roll back to https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons/releases/tag/v1.38.1 for this  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/gNGuzeTmuBkkM3cUYkzcMW)

2021-11-23T18:36:25Z	(#2gb4f5a) Rolling back to an earlier version just breaks a lot of other icons. And I can't find a way to replace it without some really ugly hacks (aka. a lot of work). So let's just keep the "tophat" for now.

2021-11-30T09:34:44Z	(#dg54gba) I believe most, if not all, the twitter profiles have some `UserDescription` It would be nice to have that shown as well.  Alternativly twtxtfeeds could autofill `# description =` with a comment that this feed it taken from twitter and generated by twtxtfeeds / feeds.twtxt.net Not sure if we can find a way to fit in both.  Also what about `# source      = twitter://delta_chat` being a propper link to twitter: `https://twitter.com/delta_chat` ?  https://feeds.twtxt.net/twitter-delta_chat/twtxt.txt

2021-12-03T13:17:39Z	(#uml4pea) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> I had similar ideas about timeline view with or without replies. A 3th option would be to be able to set filters on specific #tags. not something we use much yet, but if there was a UI to support it like in picoblog (e.g. http://darch.dk/twtxt/?tag=tag ) then i think it would be used more.
2021-12-03T14:22:54Z	(#uml4pea) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> why do you need JS, when we got https://twtxt.net/search?tag=tags
2021-12-03T15:20:00Z	(#urb3unq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> ah gotcha. I have no idea. I have never coded anything in JS, besides some p5js sketches.
2021-12-03T20:47:37Z	(#lhlqcca) I hope I have planted some seeds, so we will see if any pods starts to pop up
2021-12-04T10:12:50Z	(#mbzcyqa) Will the list be public or for each user to set up their own list?

2021-12-05T07:16:14Z	(#qei2gja) Darch comes from my last Mørch which means dark in Danish but it spell mørk when it is not a name. And since you can't use æøå I emails I just came up with sp_darch when I created my very first Hotmail back the late 90s. Pronounced: dark

2021-12-06T12:14:56Z	(#uhdpkja) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> so can we make my theme the default on ver. 1?
2021-12-06T12:29:20Z	(#ehchhdq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> whell you are free to use the old team on your pod. Getting a new default team will also work as an incentive for other to contribute the fixed you suggest
2021-12-06T14:29:57Z	(#uhdpkja) The way i have designed my theme it should be easy to change the colors (incl. a darkmode) and how round the avatar is to the pod operators liking by editing the vars in https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/themes/src/branch/master/copenhagen/static/css/99-yarn.css But there should be noting broken, just minor adjustments to be made by the community, so I see no reason why we should not at least _try_ to make it the main theme here on twtxt.net - That is why I been working on it for the last year almost.
2021-12-08T11:55:55Z	(#4yesxga) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> ´sp´ is probally me on my localhost pod
2021-12-11T16:11:57Z	(#zgh6xda) You should not use `px` but `em` or `rem` so the size will fit with your sceensize instead of some abitrary pixel number
2021-12-11T16:47:22Z	(#zgh6xda) Look good. Now you need to move the nick and time close to the image. Probably some padding or margin on either the img or the divs containing the text
2021-12-11T17:11:13Z	(#zgh6xda) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> yes I'm on mobil now. Dunno about desktop/laptop
2021-12-12T11:47:45Z	(#4v3naiq) I would not split up nick@domain since the meaning of this is needed to identify a person/feed compared to Twitter og Instagram handle. Hand to explain...
2021-12-12T12:08:00Z	(#4v3naiq) Maybe do away with the @-sign since it is kinda confusing. Like us only shows the domain but the real URL is not there at least not when the feed is on a yarn pod
2021-12-14T08:22:47Z	(#idz6nna) @<jlj https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/twtxt.txt> nice feed he got going. The we just need way to follow mastodon via feeds.twtxt.net

2021-12-14T12:13:08Z	(#paq6cna) yes there is a way to make a dropdown with pure CSS using `<detail>` and `<summary>`. I got it work in an ealier version of my theme, but I don't think it is in the git-repo.

2022-01-09T12:16:57Z	(#gvl3joa) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> Yes that is kinda the idea to build a photo/images focused interface on top of twtxt. I been trough a lots of names, but for now I'm setting on on PixelBlog, that is inspired from picoblog (php twtxt render) and Pixelfed (fediverse instagram clone).
2022-01-09T12:23:50Z	(#gvl3joa) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> The parsing of the twtxt is very simple (by [picoblog](https://0xff.nu/picoblog)) and to begin with i will keep it very raw and easy for others to make it into their own blog. It work fine on mobile as far as i have tested it. The core idea is to have a handful of php-files you can put on any server and it just works. I'm not planning to make it into a full blow client with linked conversation. My focus is just to offer a nice render of your own content on your own domain and a basic option to make new posts and upload images.
2022-01-09T12:25:24Z	(#j66xmgq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> does that also go for the avatar? I like the idea that you can just dump the image next to the twtxt.txt and you don't need to add metadata.
2022-01-09T12:47:25Z	I just dropped a bomb for breaking all of our yarnverse, but something I believe will make yarn more user-friendly: [Idea for new nick/URL scheme for pods: nick.domain.tld](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/671)

2022-01-09T16:28:20Z	(#ninijqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> but I want to 😁 (and it's called pixelblog;)
2022-01-09T16:30:59Z	(#3wunwyq) #<pixelblog https://twtxt.net/search?tag=pixelblog> is more about having a gallery-grid render of all the images posted by a user to server as a visual portfolio like this one: https://darch.dk/twtxt/gallery.php
2022-01-09T16:34:37Z	(#j66xmgq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Gotcha👍 Then we should update the instructions on yarn.social to reflects this:  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/SxZj7GuGjd4xvkJFJDbG9N.png)
2022-01-09T16:38:21Z	(#gvl3joa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Cool, but still not really what I'm going for. I would like to have a timeline view of only images, not a grid within each post, though that is a nice too:)
2022-01-09T16:42:31Z	(#3wunwyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm aware that is very slow atm because it's loading the full res images. I'm planning to have it generate thumbnails. As of now it's mostly a mockup.
2022-01-09T16:50:38Z	(#u5t4jaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I could but it would not be on my own domain and with my own styling. The feature I'm after is just this: https://www.prologic.blog/photos/

2022-01-09T17:02:05Z	(#u5t4jaa) I got it working i a very hacky way on: https://darch.dk/twtxt/gallery.php when i just scrape a folder for images to render the gallery grid and link back to the post by using a prefixed date i added to the images to match with the posts date
2022-01-09T17:07:26Z	(#u5t4jaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm not worried:)
2022-01-10T04:43:51Z	(#u5t4jaa) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> yes excslly, but the text could be the alt text of watch images shown on hover. Clicking on an image will take you to the post it appeared in.
2022-01-10T04:45:26Z	(#u5t4jaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> good question. I think the later would be most fair, but the first one might be a bit easier to implement. Also it should only be images from original posts, not images uploaded as part of replies.
2022-01-10T04:49:08Z	(#2ybh4za) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> whell it not really a new content type lige blogs og chat/DM. It only a render of the timeline in a visuals way. And it coulde maybe be a form of lists, which is a feature i think more people are interested in
2022-01-10T08:35:40Z	(#a3msvvq) Wuhoo🎉 catch me on chat🧶darch.dk or my gmail

2022-01-11T16:24:14Z	(#54z7cba) Fair enough. I'm also not using it in the wild. But I still like the idea behi do to not reinvent the wheel and using existing infrastructure
2022-01-12T05:59:51Z	(#zafemuq) I know. I deleted the IMG on purpose to test if it would propegate to the yarn pods. It was a test post as part of another talk on yarn/twtxt to some of my fellow nørds here in Copenhagen

2022-01-12T08:50:08Z	(#qacopcq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> sure thing. The most simple way I envision i a textfield under usersetting where you can type in your own CSS to owerwite what elemtes you want to change. This field will the be the last loaded CSS file for that user.

2022-01-14T06:25:16Z	(#vktsapq) Hi @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt>, sound cool. My CPH theme is pure CSS, not JS besides what's already I yarn and I have not changed at of that. But I havde changed the html temples quite a bit...
2022-01-14T06:27:09Z	(#vktsapq) It's online and running at http://yarn.algorave.dk/ again, but on an older version of yarn, so I will need some updating.
2022-01-14T06:52:08Z	With the new "Hide replies" option has become a lot easier to read through the timeline, but I think the render of OP shoulde be more prominent, more like a headline. So maybe we can try to flip the visual hierarchy so to speak and loose  the eclipse feature or expand it to 2 or 3 lines. I will try to make a mock up so you can see what I mean
2022-01-14T13:29:36Z	(#vktsapq) @<fastidious https://arrakis.netbros.com/user/fastidious/twtxt.txt> Yes I get that @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> was refereeing to CSS, but he asked me a question and i tried to answer it.

2022-01-17T11:56:05Z	(#ovbfora) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> if you look at the the leafs of a strawberry and and hazelnut three they are very similar in shape also https://lmgtfy.app/?q=strawberry+nut
2022-01-18T07:58:10Z	(#zzmwdwq) In relation to twtxt/yarn?
2022-01-18T09:33:13Z	(#pgrkgwq) - l would loose the `twt` and just call it a post and `Root post` - Call a conversation for a `conversation `or `thread` instead of inventing new words like `yarn` - I like the name Yarn for the software, but i would use normal words in the UI etc. - This is a [Post box](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Postbox_in_Viborg_Danemark.jpg), so `Post box` should be called `Input box`, `Post form` or maybe `Compose form`
2022-01-18T12:31:29Z	(#pgrkgwq) yes I agree we should define Yarn, but what we are building is not that special to the end users, who I images will just be confused about what twt, yarn, thooth etc. are. compare to using familiar words like post and tread. Tread also binds nicly with the yarn as a overall concept :) For the technical layer, then yes, we should have a vocabulary that can be closer to the "metal", but not in the UI
2022-01-18T13:04:51Z	(#pgrkgwq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> we also say to google stuff in Danish, so it's not a all uncommon outside the anglosphere. I just want to keep things simple and familiar to new users and not having a barrier of slang to overcome.  So is the idea with the Glossary to be technical documentation or what features are called in the end-user exposed UI?

2022-01-20T19:53:26Z	So can this be made with yarn/twtxt ? https://remindmeofthis.app/
2022-01-22T14:54:42Z	(#epj7qda) the url for the .txt should be the username and then nick can be whatever
2022-01-23T11:14:04Z	(#px6ifpq) @<kayos https://twtxt.net/user/kayos/twtxt.txt> I don't really see the issue with bots that you are suggesting, since twtxt/yarn is purely pull, and not push. So there might be a bunch of twtxt.txt files replying or mentioning you in a lot of post, but unless you actively follow those feeds you will not get the noise.
2022-01-23T11:31:58Z	(#s47vkla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> any change you will allow `<iframes>` to render on yarn like this post is rendered at https://darch.dk/pixelblog/?id=2022-01-23T11:22:42Z ?
2022-01-23T11:36:05Z	(#seknsra) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> how does it "look" in `tt` ?
2022-01-23T12:19:50Z	(#s47vkla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> embeding a youtube video in a post
2022-01-23T13:17:25Z	(#s47vkla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I could but I like to have a site (like algorave.dk/videos) where people can just see my content instead of having to go to youtube. And then you don't need to upload the video to more platforms. It works fine in my #<pixelblog https://twtxt.net/search?tag=pixelblog>, which it what i'm testing. I should probally include a link and a image as well as a fallback, when posting videos like this in the fututer. Regarding advertising on youtube then ublock origin is taking care of that.
2022-01-23T15:16:07Z	(#cyaddnq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Danke, it was also my initial idea to have this. The triangles is to resemble PB (B being mirrored), but playing around with just the gradient I'm tilting to something more minimal like this:  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/Z6VxptV3e2pTcXWBSBMKCa.png)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/86VwM4mjrfBCTdhip6xmcQ.png)  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/NmbC5YSU3BqsocUt75oXtP.png)

2022-01-23T21:03:13Z	(#s47vkla) Iframes is how you embed content from other sites. It might not be a pure as writing everything in go;) but it's something anyone can do since you just paste in some code to a html file. It is also used by Vimeo and SoundCloud. But I'm away that there might be some XSS issues. What other option do you have in mind? Something like the Twitter cards just the other way around could do the trick and most big tech sites offer this preview text and image

2022-01-27T15:04:27Z	(#7kuwtmq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> So to sanitize the files going thought `upload.php` is something like `preg_replace(“/[^a-z0-9\.]/”, “”, strtolower($str)); // from:http://www.touchoftechnology.com/simple-way-to-clean-up-filenames-in-php/` enough or should I use this https://gist.github.com/sumanthkumarc/2de2e2cc06c648a9f52c121501a181df or something completely different?  I relation to checking if the uploaded files is in fact images it is this code from https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_file_upload.asp good?
2022-01-27T15:07:01Z	(#7kuwtmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> You are more than welcome to nick what every ideas and features you like - the only really new think pixelblog is adding is the gallery view, where you are free to rewrite it go.

My goal is to make something anyone with ftp access can deploy in a hour without having to use a command prompt. SSH access also often comes at a extra fee if available at all. I know PHP is not the most efficient out there compared to go and static site generators like pp, but my target users are not professional programmers like you guys - `pixelblog -  a twtxt frontend not just for hackers™`

2022-01-28T17:57:40Z	(#qs4ihcq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> let do what? sorry I'm not sure what we are talking about...
2022-01-30T07:49:53Z	(#teequ3a) Simple answer: no, don't do it. For the uses cases use something else instead of adding complexity to twtxt
2022-01-30T10:46:10Z	(#teequ3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> to be fair I did not read the spec and I hadn't had my coffee yet😴You are of couse as aways free to build what you like. I just see twtxt/yarn/pixelblog as a way for open broadcasting. Private communication would be better of using separate technology. I just rather see a working search and filtering feature build into yarn or as a separate service than adding features that is in my opinion out of scope for twtxt.
2022-01-30T11:16:58Z	(#7s52vmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> nice😊 what I have done in Pixelblog is to filter out posts contains any markdown image (`![](url)`) and render eatch match as its own image, that then links back to the original post See the code for [gallery.php](https://github.com/sorenpeter/pixelblog/blob/main/twtxt/system/gallery.php)  Do you want to have gallery view for all the feeds someone follows or just under eatch user on the profile page?
2022-01-31T08:31:13Z	(#phdhdyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> I also like the idea about a separate feed for encrypted messages using the post-as feature maybe, so it's easier for other clients to no see the noise of salty jibberish
2022-01-31T09:03:47Z	(#phdhdyq) Could we turn twtxt on it head, so these encrypted feeds are something that all participant are writing to, more like a IRC channel: `2021-01-31T09:59:00Z   <darch> message` ?
2022-01-31T09:37:35Z	(#phdhdyq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> by everyone having write access to the feed using some API maybe.
2022-02-04T18:23:38Z	(#hked5eq) I kinda enjoyed it, but yeah it's lacking all the philosophy from the first ones -  [The Critical Drinker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8n8WdpW9tA) does a good there-down (contains spoilers!)
2022-02-07T04:15:54Z	(#a5rj62a) Best news in a long time
2022-02-10T06:08:05Z	Tonight (@18:00 CET) there is a online presentation of a new book on socialist social media that I think would be of interest for waht we are doing here with text/yarn https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/platform-socialism-tickets-250158339327
2022-02-13T19:47:10Z	(#43sqgna) Great idea to connect with the indeiewb folks. I will be sleeping at that time (3 in the morning in my timezone) but looking forward to hear about it afterwards
2022-02-14T04:43:48Z	(#43sqgna) I know, but by I have a 9 till 4 job that I need to attend to.
2022-02-14T14:32:38Z	(#gpwdxra) nice, bookmarked
2022-02-16T08:48:29Z	(#5zolnzq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> so it wil be a bot for each city in the world? Also for inspiration: https://twitter.com/emojiweatherdk and https://twitter.com/EmojiWeatherUK (witch i will just add to feeds.twtxt.net)
2022-02-17T10:07:56Z	(#2dzwvzq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> yes I have had smilar ideas where you can theme your post. I images an CSS class for each user that will the take the hex-colors of their liking.
2022-02-17T10:13:22Z	(#y72gj7q) Just keep an eye on: https://events.indieweb.org/  Would love to see some yarn support for events :D Here are some tools for inspiration: - https://gath.io - https://gettogether.community - https://meetable.org
2022-02-17T11:18:03Z	(#4oz7fmq) @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> and @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yes I'm also all for using existing stuff that works instead of building monoliths. Not completely sure what you meant with: > iCal feed/bot thingy
2022-02-17T11:25:34Z	(#4oz7fmq) Having a twtxt feed from a service like Gath would be a nice addition to get notified about events in your timeline. I'm sure that would be possible to build and add to gath
2022-02-17T12:49:48Z	(#4oz7fmq) There are already support for masondon and Friendica, so why not twtxt https://github.com/lowercasename/gathio/wiki/Fediverse-Instructions
2022-02-17T16:58:20Z	On the notes of #<indieweb https://twtxt.net/search?tag=indieweb> and #<platformsocialism https://twtxt.net/search?tag=platformsocialism> this guys talk on "Decentralisation begins at decentring yourself" really nails a lot of what we are doing here with twtxt/yarn: the why and the how, also how to make sure it is financially sustainable: https://ar.al/2022/02/16/decentralisation-begins-at-decentring-yourself/  We need to start a conversation with small-tech.org and see if twtxt/yarn/etc. could be part of what they are creating
2022-02-18T05:52:05Z	(#rwlmg7q) They, small-tech.org, were hosting a live stream yesterday where I asked Aral if he know about twtxt and yarn.social. He did not, but he does now was his answer😉
2022-02-18T06:03:26Z	(#4oz7fmq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> using something like Gath for the event pages and RSPV handling makes a lot of sense. Gaths email model makes it easy for anyone to sign up.  Then we just add some event UI features to yarn like: - click "Ceate event" in the yarn UI  - takes you to gath.twtxt.net and create event - post public link to event to timeline of the user or if pod-events user
2022-02-21T05:17:25Z	(#c6fqgna) Why not just add multiline markdown support for the description field and let peopl use that instead?!
2022-02-21T05:36:54Z	(#c6fqgna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> fair enough. I guess I just don't really see the need for this feature for where we are right now. I rather have search, filters and lists that pinned posts (but I have also expressed that before ;)
2022-02-21T05:40:02Z	(#c6fqgna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I know what you are talking about😊 but the idea with pinned posts is to have some info at the top of you timeline/profile page and that can just as well be done with the description field. Also how would a pinned post look in the twtxt.txt file or will it be pod-only feature?
2022-02-22T10:58:14Z	(#tkinmuq) Did reply now. But I would be up for discussing these more in depth on a video call sometime
2022-02-23T08:49:43Z	(#z7kpfrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> any change to make this feed render the video inline in the yarn UI ?  I tried to adding the atom-feed (https://thecodinglove.com/atom) instead of RSS, but twtxtfeed tells me "Feed already exists" - so maybe it can render the gifs/videos?
2022-02-23T12:16:54Z	(#z4vwpjq) @<apex gemini://rawtext.club/~apex/twtxt.txt> that sounds interesting. Is you client offline first?
2022-02-24T11:17:06Z	(#e5qz2gq) @<apex gemini://rawtext.club/~apex/twtxt.txt> by offline-first I mean that you can use the client locally on the phone without an account on a yarn pod, similar to how the original twtxt client works. If this is the case how will it post/upload to a self-hosted twtxt.txt-file?
2022-02-24T13:02:40Z	(#e5qz2gq) @<david https://netbros.com/user/david/twtxt.txt> I'm not sure where I picked up the term "offline-first", but how @<apex gemini://rawtext.club/~apex/twtxt.txt> describes it above is what I had in mind.
2022-02-24T13:08:09Z	(#eihkmna) @<apex gemini://rawtext.club/~apex/twtxt.txt> Nice, looking forward to taking it for a spin soon  @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> will you whitelist images from `rawtext.club` ?
2022-02-24T13:23:32Z	(#i4nyfaq) I did see you reply, but I have noting to add. I know how twtxt works and to some extend also yarn, so no need to explain the obvious 😉
2022-03-07T08:45:43Z	(#35kn2ia) This guys are making some really cool tools - especially I want to use his [crabmail](https://crabmail.flounder.online/) to replaces various groups on Facebook, but I might want images support
2022-03-08T21:02:15Z	(#7la3hna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't know about `dsarch` 😉 but I guess this is the link you are looking for https://ar.al/2022/02/16/decentralisation-begins-at-decentring-yourself/
2022-03-10T15:21:08Z	(#xnjhgha) I also just got plugged into the matrix as `@darch:data.coop`
2022-03-10T15:35:06Z	(#ooxps7q) Why do we need to build chat into yarn? Can't you just run a matrix server and yarn pod on the same domain and be done with it?
2022-03-13T19:38:38Z	(#gpcekvq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> nope but I also did not contact [ar.al](http://ar.al) directly, only asked in the chat during a live stream under the name  "anonymous"

2022-04-03T18:57:22Z	(#ypbpysq) Hmm there seem to be especially an problem with feeds from `twtxt.net`, since feeds from other servers seem to be updated faster. So, @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> do you maybe need to whitelist my new pod somewhere at your end?
2022-04-03T19:00:16Z	(#ypbpysq) or did we maybe mess up in the setup somewhere, so there now is a name conflict, because we forgot to change something in swarm-stack that i pulled down to my VPS
