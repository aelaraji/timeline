2022-08-04T18:24:24+02:00	If you see this - then please give a reply so I know it all worked :) Good to be back by the way.
2022-08-04T18:46:50+02:00	@<carsten http://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> (#j3vewbq) Nice images!
2022-08-04T19:04:59+02:00	(#c2eqblq) we har more rain in a day then what we had the whole previous month. been raining a lot these days, but now the sun is here again :)
2022-08-04T19:06:00+02:00	hm, testing latest mobile client, seems like replies does not work. hmm.
2022-08-04T19:09:39+02:00	(#c2eqblq) We hd more rain in a day then the previous month. But now the sun i back again :)
2022-08-04T19:32:13+02:00	One thing that happened since last I was here, is that we got a husky puppy, we got him in April, here is a picture when we got him, and one 4 months later :) his name is Nanook.  ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/ogcVkE6y6nrKqF8mqSFXH8.png)
2022-08-04T19:37:21+02:00	Another picture of him. Love those blue eyes.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/aX9nYSF8ubjreZqN7WPfjT.png)
2022-08-04T19:42:00+02:00	(#5unwita) Not sure if this helps in any way, but I had problems with this when I ran gnusocial, i then disabled http 1.0 or 1.1  in apache, that stopped 99.9% of them.

2022-08-04T21:26:44+02:00	Added some of my latest photos to my timeline :)
2022-08-05T11:18:15+02:00	Good morning everyone,  how are you all doing today?
2022-08-05T12:18:12+02:00	(#ywvhfda) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> doing well, 12 in the afternoon here, just came home from a walk in the woods with our dog, really warm and sunny today.
2022-08-05T12:48:08+02:00	(#4egfhoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I installed my own on my vps :)
2022-08-05T12:48:32+02:00	(#ywvhfda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> oh, what illness did you get?
2022-08-05T12:56:23+02:00	(#ywvhfda) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> thank you :) I'm taking some more over the weekend, I'll share them as well :)
2022-08-05T13:00:48+02:00	(#4egfhoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> i see your reply has twtxt account for my name in it - that account got removed some time ago.
2022-08-05T13:31:25+02:00	(#4egfhoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> feel free to do so :) I do not plan to have it open for registration though. I might buy a domain and run a public one later on. But for not the one I run was for me.
2022-08-05T13:54:36+02:00	(#ywvhfda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thank you, I like them as well, getting closer to autumn now, my favourite time of year for landscape photography in the morning and late evening :)
2022-08-05T20:49:41+02:00	![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/VrWKyRkQGezo6MnoHFmcsK.png)
2022-08-05T23:05:28+02:00	I was supposed to try paragliding behind a boat tomorrow,  but there seems to be too much wind, but fingers crossed, might be able to do so anyways, we'll see tomorrow :)
2022-08-06T23:11:00+02:00	We got a ride on a 106 year old steamboat today :)  ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/7vmp8DR8HNMaPzERML24JB.png)
2022-08-06T23:13:13+02:00	![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/3JdhhAdzQEiQ8LHK3CREUN.png)
2022-08-08T15:37:37+02:00	(#7fp6wnq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> yup :)
2022-08-08T21:33:29+02:00	Kids are in bed, dog is sleeping, Marlyn is watching Tv, and I'm on the computer trying to figure out what to do for the rest of the night. Last week of vacation now, so I get more and more interrested in doing things on the computer. Played around a bit with my Risc-v SBC today (Mangopi), it runs debian, got everything updated and all that, thinking about setting up a webserver on it. It has 512mb ram, so it should be fine to host some static website on it.
2022-08-09T10:31:40+02:00	(#yh3j5iq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  [https://mangopi.cc/mangopi_mqpro](https://mangopi.cc/mangopi_mqpro) Search for it on amazon.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/vkSpfdzEXtSB2Jr9n6ePje.png)
2022-08-09T11:10:35+02:00	(#yh3j5iq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> golang seems to work on it, so Ill give a try on compiling yarn on it tonight. Would be fun if it works.
2022-08-09T14:32:27+02:00	The US put tornadocash on sanction list. Deleted github accounts and source. Since North Korea used it to launder stolen crypto.  And people are surprised that it happened? Github is and never have been a safe place to store code. Tor/i2p is much more safer places to host code. But I understand why people use github, I do so as well for public project, but I also selfhost my other things
2022-08-09T14:35:36+02:00	Also later today I need to set up that startupscript for yarnd, tired of manually starting it when vps boots.
2022-08-09T15:10:38+02:00	(#luzvloq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think I saw something on the wiki. Ill check again tonight.
2022-08-09T15:34:40+02:00	(#6lytfga) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> perfect, thank you :)
2022-08-13T11:23:49+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  on yarn.social I cannot see the link for the list of pods ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/sVbKqwJWPoC56x8Pmvsd4S.png)
2022-08-14T10:53:28+02:00	Tomorrow I go back to the office after 4 weeks off, going to be rough to get up in the morning :p
2022-08-14T11:04:08+02:00	(#voakm4q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I usually get up at 05:30, no matter how late I fall a asleep, get in early, get home early 😀
2022-08-17T12:37:26+02:00	(#mldsula) Only time something like that has happened on my end is if browser got updated while its running (trough package manager). But I only run firefox..
2022-08-19T07:42:59+02:00	New day at the office, been a nice first week after vacation so far, but weekend is always appreciated! Not sure what we're going to do yet - but I'm sure going to enjoy the days off work :)
2022-08-20T09:42:07+02:00	Good morning to you all, new day is here. Nice with weekend. Today I want to code a bit, and then do some flightsim tonight.
2022-08-20T13:56:55+02:00	(#xbfehqq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> always nice with a easy fix!
2022-08-22T19:38:34+02:00	What  games do you all play these days?
2022-08-23T17:42:23+02:00	![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/oZnpgrgNtigQYGpMxso9um.png)
2022-08-26T06:36:14+02:00	Mark Zuckerberg on joe rogan , looking forward to hear this later today. I hope Joe is very critical.
2022-08-26T09:22:29+02:00	(#emskcjq) https://open.spotify.com/episode/51gxrAActH18RGhKNza598?si=Vm-CNRSRQY-sUEIhrz8vvQ&utm_source=copy-link
2022-08-26T16:02:20+02:00	Finally weekend again :) what are you all planning? I'll do the usual stuff - family time, walk the dog, code, sleep :)
2022-08-26T20:10:24+02:00	(#6oanupa) I use encrypted email as well. But not frequently,  since almost noone does the same.
2022-08-26T22:45:27+02:00	(#2wamegq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> we had a crazy amount of rain today, could barely get home, so much water on all the roads and such.
2022-08-27T11:12:17+02:00	Started my morning with a long walk with the dog, getting very warm today, so if I do not walk in the morning I have to do that in the late evening. So now he's tired, had breakfast and just chills outside. Nice way to start this Saturday :)
2022-09-01T14:39:46+02:00	My vps went down this morning, but everything is back up now.
2022-09-01T15:44:44+02:00	Need another couch soon, haha ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/dpZeNKKVfWsZzP7pqpexVR.png)
2022-09-01T17:48:37+02:00	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#vqd4c5a) yeah, in a row. but yes, I like it :) got a nice terrace and a bit of garden too. :)
2022-09-01T21:47:23+02:00	yup, amazing coincidence.. ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/WhRuVoqmsrjGfAfuvcGZ2Y.png)
2022-09-02T15:27:02+02:00	Have a great weekend everyone!
2022-09-02T20:15:29+02:00	Installing NixOS on my spare laptop today. It's a fun OS to work with. Has its quirks, but I enjoy messing around with it and set things up the way I want it. :)
2022-09-03T11:43:52+02:00	started my day by going to the dogpark. had a really nice time. now it's time to telax and enjoy the weekend.
2022-09-04T20:31:40+02:00	spent some hours in the dogpark with a colleague of mine and his dog, our dogs got along great :) was really nice.
2022-09-07T08:45:25+02:00	have a nice day everyone!  ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/vPPTEH5sn4hAbquLYQap7F.png)
2022-09-08T06:43:05+02:00	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#p2jg5nq) test towers for rig equipment on the dock at our office :) the company I work for makes oilrig equipment. I work with simulator development for oilrigs etc.
2022-09-08T10:39:06+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#mfehdla) No, because we develop the best tech for it, with the strictest rules. we also adapt to new stuff, so I feel Im helping every day with making things better and better. But honestly it has crossed my mind at times. But Im here being part of innovation and new technologies, doing my part. :)
2022-09-09T18:19:59+02:00	@<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> (#mazysgq) thank you for posting his, need to check it out, have not seen this before.
2022-09-10T17:51:19+02:00	(#typno3a) We had a neighbor that went away for a week, and his fire alarm beeped because of low battery all that time, and we could hear it pretty loud at our place...
2022-09-11T10:56:16+02:00	(#dkj52nq) happy birthday!
2022-09-11T23:01:39+02:00	@<carsten http://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> (#erafajq) I have the same problem, at work I work with c÷÷, c#, java, python and qt. I want to learn more rust, but its a pain to get into.
2022-09-14T08:48:40+02:00	![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/uAN7f8jAWjqyRryxXzG3vg.png)
2022-09-14T09:06:26+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#hbjwd6q) this morning was really nice :) love this time of year.
2022-09-14T19:22:24+02:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#hbjwd6q) Thank you :) always nice to have this view when I go to the office, stand there, vape a bit, enjoy the view and silence before heading in and code all day. :)
2022-09-15T21:00:53+02:00	![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/oePE78DRnMrhGEyRGHZTQf.png)
2022-09-17T19:27:27+02:00	working with c++, windows, cmake and wxwidgets reminded me on why I want to learn more rust. rust and crates makes it really easy to get up and running, crossplatform. scrapping what I did today, I'll start over and force my self to learn rust.
2022-09-17T20:29:30+02:00	(#jfxyeaq) @<movq https://uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Will do :)
2022-09-17T20:44:02+02:00	(#jfxyeaq) Decided to use FLTK crate, that one is easy to get set up, works well. Now I have to figure out how to make a class that holds the gui elements I need. I want to parse the yarn status file, then show the statuses, then once that works I'll make it fetch it online etc. Will take some time, but I feel a bit more motivated (for now) to do this in rust.
2022-09-18T09:56:41+02:00	started the Sunday with a nice walk.  ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/KdDMQYEZby3fjLR3iUQGDU.png)

2022-10-02T12:36:38+02:00	Another beautiful Sunday morning walk.  ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/5sN9PzffvPuxZTgPKt3Q4S.png)
2022-10-02T14:57:16+02:00	@<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> (#hpaub2q) its a river. and we're walking in a log flume along it. got there early, so not many people, but when I got back the parking lot was starting to get packed. walked about 9km.
2022-10-02T20:47:38+02:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#hpaub2q) Thank you very much!
2022-10-02T20:51:20+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#hpaub2q) thank you :) always nice to share a piece of nature in a photo. I love to spend time outside. my brain goes silent, and I can take in the views and listen to the sounds around me, I never get tired of it. and since its autumn- it changes the landscape every day.
2022-10-06T16:19:18+02:00	Its very hard to see the number with dark theme when you have small font on phone. I kinda want to change the blue to a more grey, and keep the letters white.  ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/u6wT4fuSEjfkUijWDCntKL.png)

2022-10-15T13:43:17+02:00	(#ljh7pza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thank you, it was really nice. The dog wanted to get up at 8 this morning, so I put him in the car and went for a long walk so that the rest of the house could sleep in. I came back last night after 4 day work trip, so it was nice to get up today and just head out for a walk.
2022-10-15T21:21:18+02:00	(#ljh7pza) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> thank you 😀

2022-10-28T20:28:31+02:00	Should we hype this up a bit on twitter? Wonder who finds their way over here the next days.
2022-10-30T20:37:23+01:00	(#scxyieq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> something similar was done on diaspora some time back. A user posted a lot of things that the community did not want, so all pod admins ran a script to get rid of the user/posts.
2022-10-30T20:53:00+01:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#in546lq) very nice!
2022-11-10T15:47:05+01:00	would it be possible to have some indication if you already follow a person? like where the profile pic is - some indication if you are already following or not? I often have to click in to know.

2022-11-19T16:00:21+01:00	(#fuuwrha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Most likely, ancient debian on that webserver - I'll assume the problem is on my end and see if I can get it sorted.
2022-11-19T16:10:26+01:00	(#fuuwrha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Upgrading debian now on server, fingers crossed :)
2022-11-19T16:22:03+01:00	(#fuuwrha) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Tried that - but that did not seem to change anything. But still - worth to do the update anyways, that way I do not have to worry about that for a good while. It's a pain when it falls too far behind.
2022-11-19T18:39:40+01:00	Tired of running owncloud, switched to syncthing, takes some time to set up all devices, but I'm glad to finally be pushed to set it up.
2022-11-19T18:40:50+01:00	Also I need to set up a new website with a static site generator. Ill most likely give hugo a try again.
2022-11-19T18:43:22+01:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#nxt3r4a) what are you making?
2022-11-19T18:45:56+01:00	Every saturday evening we either bake pizza or make nachos, we then watch a movie together as a family, we have done this every saturday since our first child was born 10 years ago. We all look forward to Saturday evenings :)
2022-11-19T18:53:17+01:00	@<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> (#fczllqq) yeah, all my computers and devices are on 24/7. but I'll install it on my webserver (vps) as well, and let that one be the master device. my desktop is backed up to spideroak at all times, so when I sync there it backs things up. Im not too worried about the issue if something causes a conflict. There is only one file that worries me, and that is my keepass file. I might keep that elsewhere to be sure, I have not decided yet.
2022-11-19T20:13:34+01:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#cvc5bbq) very nice! we went from 12/13c down to negative today, so we had our first snow. There will be more snow tomorrow:)
2022-11-20T10:37:42+01:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#fi4euqq) home made pizza :) we saw a move with a ghost, a bit like casper.
2022-11-20T13:10:06+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#fuuwrha) git worked after upgrade. But I seem to have to reinstall go. I have not done that yet. I will see if I have time to fix that later tonight.
2022-11-21T16:13:47+01:00	I love flightsimming. Bought the latest xplane last night. resumed my flight around the world in a tiny plane.. VR, pedals, yoke and throttle setup.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/bsEqfQHZxfTV4dM6rdyiHc.png)
2022-11-21T16:16:01+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what files do I need to update on my server if I decide to compile yarnd on another machine? (wondering so that I do not brick anything)..
2022-11-22T15:54:17+01:00	Brought our dog to work today, so nice to have one that handles the cold without any issues. He just chills in his crate in the car while I work, and I take some small breaks to let him stretch his legs. Loves to play around in the snow. I could then take the 'long' walk on my way home instead of getting home first - then head out again.
2022-11-22T15:55:51+01:00	(#qch4rba) I'll see if I have time tonight, I'll take a backup of everything, then test a bit. I'll let you know if I get stuck on anything. thank you for asking :)
2022-11-22T15:57:07+01:00	@<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> (#qijkcba) flightgear is great! I like the fact that it works on linux, same goes for xplane, that alone is the reason why I do not buy MS flightsim.

2022-11-29T20:16:19+01:00	(#byijdoa) Well, people should be able to talk, even if it's the 'wrong' topic.  I think the whole 'covid disinformation' policy at twitter and others (spotify) is ridiculous. A banner that pops up telling you to go 'here' for latest info is crazy. People die from all kinds of things, covid is no exception from that, but no other virus has been put on display like this one. And also not even being able to discuss things around it (except for the cemented truth) is not something I like. I'm not a conspiracy theorist or anything like that - but I love discussing things, and when you cannot even do that - then I have a issue with it. So many people got banned for simply discussing or trying to discuss issues around it.
2022-11-30T18:01:04+01:00	how are all of you doing these days? I'm all good, work, family time and the usual walks with our dog. :)

2022-12-08T20:09:11+01:00	(#l6766xq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Taken on my usual walk with the dog after work :) Every day I get there around the same time - just in time to catch the sunset.
2022-12-09T19:24:35+01:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#l6766xq) when I take him to work I walk him at the parkinglot when I need a break. and on my way home I walk a km or two, and then around the neighbourhood as needed later. But when I go for long walks during the weekend I can walk anywhere from 10km to 20, then the rest is as needed around the house. so he's well adjusted to short walks as well as long. today he pulled our kids on snow sleds on the street outside here, was really fun :) it was his first time trying that, and I could barely keep up with him. haha.
2022-12-10T14:26:42+01:00	today I'm just chilling. dog slept until 09:30 today, new record, felt good not to get up early today. put on the latest podcast from lex freedman with coffeezilla, I enjoy the topic of crypto currencies.
2022-12-10T21:08:37+01:00	Installed latest NixOS on my secondary laptop tonight, was really nice with a proper installer (calamares installer), got most of the stuff I use set up, but I do need to tweak some more. I love the way the system is set up, makes it very easy to have the same setup on several machines. I'll try and run it and use it as much as I can now.

2023-01-14T20:33:12+01:00	Finally back! My VPS's main drive got toasted.

2023-01-20T16:00:13+01:00	do anyone know anything about wireguard? I have a VPS, which runs nginx. If I then want tjat to host something from my house, do I then set up vps as wiregiard server, connect from my house to it - and then serve the wireguard client? or do it the other way around? I think I have to look into it this weekend. would be a nice way to test out things.
2023-01-20T16:43:16+01:00	@<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> (#2lf3mmq) ok, good to know. Yeah I have static. But after thinking about it I'll most likely set up the server side at home, that way I can more easily connect to other things at home from remote.

2023-01-21T11:10:04+01:00	good morning! how are you all doing today?  got up early, went for a walk with the dog in our city centre, nice to train a bit on that where there's many people and dogs.
2023-01-21T12:36:42+01:00	I have a fanless pc, with intel I7 (if I remember correct). Today Ill get it installed with latest alma linux, set up the things I want with docker (I usually do not use docker  I just do not like it), but I see how useful it can be, so Im going to force my self to use it. Then when all services are running Ill use wireguard to hook it up to my VPS. I think this will be a great setup.
2023-01-21T12:48:14+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#5vwuaaa) I promise to join another time, we're on our way out the door (heading to the mall).

2023-01-27T12:29:41+01:00	Gonna buy some firewood today, to use in our firepit, love sitting outside late - make some good food for my kids on the fire, then just sit and talk and have fun, look at the stars etc :) Gonna be a nice weekend for sure.
2023-01-27T13:45:43+01:00	(#z4fphma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Me too! I really wanted to do some winter camping this year, but I have not been motivated enough to pack up and go when the weekend comes - but one day soon I will head out and do that :)
2023-01-27T21:29:41+01:00	Glad I got my test server that I can play around with. Been messing with docker today, and got nextcloud all set up the way I want, so now I can do the same on my VPS. Getting the hang of this now.
2023-01-28T14:54:33+01:00	went to the dogpark today, was awesome. 6 other dogs there and he ran for 2 hours without a break. now he's sleeping :) so now I can relax for a bit and enjoy the rest of this Saturday.
2023-01-29T18:44:49+01:00	just found out about wiregui - https://github.com/Devsfy/wiregui I have to test this one.
2023-01-29T21:42:03+01:00	@<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> (#qijuytq) I honestly did not know they had one.. I thought it was cli only.
2023-01-31T21:23:31+01:00	![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/48QYwretqt5985eeAAcCYU.png)
2023-02-01T23:11:42+01:00	@<axodys https://octobloc.xyz/user/axodys/twtxt.txt> (#ztbqpcq) which one did you like?
2023-02-02T16:26:47+01:00	@<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> (#hq7z3va) I do not like that either. too much noise there. Does not feel meaningful in any way yet.
2023-02-03T12:45:19+01:00	Norway is buying 54 new tanks. Sweet upgrade. All though the current war is a distance from Norway - it's still our neighbour who is causing it. So it's always in the back of my mind.
2023-02-04T18:11:57+01:00	At least I started on something today. Been months and months since I did anything. I started on a asset I want to use in a short I want to make some day.  Not done yet at all, but blocking things out just so I get a feel for it.  ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/3D2sJFMUVBunLABvahLo8S.png)
2023-02-04T18:14:21+01:00	also, our dog does not sleep long on weekends, but today I refused to get up early  once he started to get riled up I walked over to his crate, told him to sleep, sniffed my hand and he then stopped and got back to sleep, did that two times, and got up at 10 instead of 8. felt great!
2023-02-05T10:45:28+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#iz2ylca) going to be a huge radio telescope. qorking on various scifi assets.
2023-02-05T10:45:40+01:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#iz2ylca) haha, I wish!
2023-02-06T20:16:17+01:00	I bought a 256GB usb a couple of weeks ago, I now want a OS on it with persistent storage. I only have 1 drive on my newest laptop at the moment, so I do not want to dualboot and such, so a os on the usb stick is a nice option. Tonight I'm testing NomadBSD - https://nomadbsd.org/index.html Will flash it in a couple of minutes, hope it boots fine with my hardware.
2023-02-06T20:41:23+01:00	(#mnkqnjq) It booted fine! currently creating partitions etc. I like that you could enable encryption. when its done I'll go through my usual routine and set up all development tools etc and get some stuff compiled.
2023-02-06T22:03:39+01:00	(#mnkqnjq) annoyingly it did not boot after install. prints : CCB request completed with an error.. argh.
2023-02-07T19:03:33+01:00	(#mnkqnjq) decided to boot it again. turns out I typed the wrong encryption password yesterday, and instead of saying that it printed that error. booted fine now :)
2023-02-07T19:07:20+01:00	(#mnkqnjq) sadly wifi does not work. have to check that later.
2023-02-08T09:26:01+01:00	Wish you all a great day!
2023-02-10T12:44:07+01:00	Enjoy the weekend everyone!
2023-02-11T12:45:45+01:00	today we went and played some football together and went to the park. later Ill take the dog to the dogpark,  some bigger dogs are going there later today, so that'll be fun for Nanook. other then that we'll have nachos tonight, and saturday candy plus a movie :) going to be a nice day!

2023-02-11T18:25:07+01:00	can I post on yarn through curl?
2023-02-11T18:59:10+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#mjcdeaq) do you have an example somewhere? want to tinker a bit and use libcurl for it
2023-02-12T11:59:29+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#mjcdeaq) thank you so much! perfect for what I needed.
2023-02-12T19:04:03+01:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#bzubzqq) I do not have a picture of the sunset here, but it was really nice here too :) thanks for sharing, always nice to see :)
2023-02-12T20:53:29+01:00	Happy birthday Nanook! 1 year already :) ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/UgekXD9HaGqBqnB8Hdf5yb.png)
2023-02-13T07:10:55+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#qwxfdta) yup, Alaskan Husky :)
2023-02-13T07:12:54+01:00	@<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#qwxfdta) hehe, we have never brushed his teeth to be honest, but he gets high quality food, without grain / potatoes, pure dried meat pellets, and raw frozen meat that we defrost and mix in. he also chews a lot of bone as well.
2023-02-14T20:57:21+01:00	got up at 7 this morning, 14 hours later I finally get to sit down. time to chill before sleep :)
2023-02-15T08:42:52+01:00	@<cel https://celehner.com/twtxt.txt> (#baivtua) hi there!
2023-02-16T07:42:19+01:00	Good morning! Wish you all a great day!
2023-02-16T10:59:18+01:00	(#nwh2g5q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Good evening! How are you doing today?
2023-02-16T11:11:54+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#nwh2g5q) doing fine, the dily grind. But look forward to the weekend, going to a indoor trampoline park with my kids, and weather is going to be nice (not rain) as well, so Ill try and get on a hike with them as well, have a fire, cook some food and just enjoy being out in the forest :)
2023-02-17T07:36:04+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#el5mh5a) that would be very nice, and remove the need to have more services running. I think it would attract more people to run this to use that, sunce yarnd is very easy to set up and run.
2023-02-17T08:04:19+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#el5mh5a) personally I would like it integrated and opt-in. just enable with a flag when starting up yarnd.
2023-02-17T08:06:59+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#el5mh5a) a separate binay would work too, maybe yarnd could just start it. if its a separate project - then it could possibly be useful for others as well? Im not sure, Im just thinking - the easier it is to set up and run - the better it is for everyone. Im sure it can be easy to set up and use either way.
2023-02-17T11:09:38+01:00	(#7ax6riq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That is a good point. I do not mind either way, but I have to admit I do not know enough about it to tell if one solution is better then the other. But I think it's important to make it so that it brings others onboard as well as you say. I would definitely use it - since that would remove the need to set up other things to communicate with others, so It would be a most welcomed feature to have.
2023-02-17T13:03:23+01:00	A storm is hitting us today, it just arrived it seems! Exciting day! Hopefully our roof won't come off today.
2023-02-17T14:49:58+01:00	(#ryziffq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Not too bad, but right now it's calm again, but somewhere around 40m sec wind or something like that. They have sent our a orange warning, which typically means it gets proper windy. But we'll see :) Neven been so bad that it destroys something where I live, but trees and stuff like that often cuts power some times, and trees over the roads etc, but nothing too bad usually.
2023-02-17T19:37:27+01:00	(#or6a3ia) @<GopherChat http://magical.fish:70/feeds/twtxt/twtxt.txt> Just install lynx, and tor, and then set proxy?      Edit /etc/lynx-site.cfg     Add:     http_proxy:http://proxy.abc.xyz:8080
2023-02-17T20:03:04+01:00	My kids joined me on the long walk I had with the dog this afternoon, just before the storm came. I walked - they took their bikes. Was nice to spend this time with them today and not walk the round alone :) Now it’s time to just wind down and relax for the rest of the evening. Will probably spend some time on my computer today.
2023-02-18T08:25:36+01:00	good morning to you all! what are you all doing today?
2023-02-18T10:37:04+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#bogawja) very cool! thanks for doing this!

2023-02-18T13:24:40+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#pbv54aa) thank you, I took it last weekend :)
2023-02-18T15:39:16+01:00	Took my daughter's kickbike again and let Nanook pull for some kilometres, he was really good today, fun to see him correct around obstacles, and when he looks back at me while running to make sure things are OK. I really need to get a offroad kickbike that I can use, makes it more safe too - because he runs fast. I know Ill get one in mid May, hopefully sooner.
2023-02-18T15:39:39+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#67r5mnq) good night! sleep well!
2023-02-18T15:40:25+01:00	@<GopherChat http://magical.fish:70/feeds/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (#hpe7exq) yeah, that sounds like a good idea to get that up to a more recent version.
2023-02-19T16:42:03+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#4k57gwa) yay!
2023-02-19T16:42:35+01:00	@<james https://yarn.mills.io/user/james/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#b2hbv2q) very very cool!
2023-02-20T10:06:05+01:00	(#4u6tosq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I would love to help! But I do not (at this time) know enough about that to help out unfortunately..
2023-02-20T20:05:22+01:00	tonight Im going to tinker a bit with my Mangopi riscv board. runs debian. I want to update it and install some new stuff on it.
2023-02-20T20:06:38+01:00	(#3b5qtnq) Also wifi is only working by tether through my phone, I want to see if I can get that sorted.
2023-02-20T20:37:13+01:00	(#hvgjasa) Seems like the best option is to reflash the SD card - I do not want to deal with that tonight, I'll leave that for tomorrow. So I'll do other things tonight :)
2023-02-21T06:57:07+01:00	(#3b5qtnq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Yeah, that is correct :) I use it for testing, but I set it up as any desktop system as close as I can, with all the things I usually use. I'm really excited about riscv - I have another board as well, which is more like a arduino, but I never got that one to do anything useful, but the mangopo - is as you say more usefull since it's just like a raspberrypi zero, and works very well.  But I am looking forward to that day I can have a proper desktop system (or laptop) with riscv. There was a board released some time ago that let you do that, but the price was a bit too high for me .So now I wait for the next thing to come out.
2023-02-21T17:15:16+01:00	getting a new phone soon. Ill go for a iphone 14 this time.  I have always had android, but Im a bit tired of it now to be honest, want something else. I will get the standard model. the others are way too expensive. I use it mostly for photos, so I hope its good (either way it'll  be better then what I have now).
2023-02-21T18:38:54+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I start my yarnd through command line, is there a way to enable the activitypub that way? or do I need to do it some other way? (I compiled the latest source)
2023-02-22T06:43:36+01:00	(#bjjgk4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ah, thank you! I will test this after work today. Thank you!
2023-02-22T06:50:24+01:00	(#bjjgk4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you for doing this! I'm really excited about this feature!
2023-02-22T08:44:14+01:00	What do you all think about the UFO thing going on? Do you believe some of them are aliens? (tictac  \ go-fast etc)? Do you think some government have a real UFO stashed away somewhere?
2023-02-22T13:02:34+01:00	(#qhwfdbq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm thinking more in general - about the balloons and stuff that's been in the news.  It's just some of the comments they have made publicly, calling it a balloon in one setting, then 'object' in another.. I think all of those where just that - balloons, but either way some of those UAP's are strange.  And I always wonder if someone has a craft from some other world or not.  It would not be weird in any way if some aliens evolved way beyond us, and it would not be weird if someone visited us here. We would do the same if we found a planet with life.  All in all it's just fascinating to think about these things.
2023-02-22T14:49:32+01:00	@<prx https://si3t.ch/twtxt.txt> (#5jotepq) I have a x200 with that :) very nice to have!
2023-02-22T14:49:58+01:00	@<prx https://si3t.ch/twtxt.txt> (#5jotepq) mine has libreboot.
2023-02-22T14:51:15+01:00	home from work. feed the dog, then walk in the forest in the rain. after that it's computer time :)
2023-02-22T18:44:11+01:00	(#bjjgk4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> - when I start it I get this error: `INFO[0000] started websub processor                      ERRO[0000] error setting up ap                           error="error getting support feed: error: feed not found" FATA[0000] error creating server                         error="error getting support feed: error: feed not found"`
2023-02-22T20:27:52+01:00	I do not write much, but I decided to write a post about our dog. https://stigatle.no/posts/2023-07-02-husky/  I'm trying to write a bit more on my website, so it felt natural to write about this. I also have some other posts I want to do later on about other things that I do.
2023-02-22T21:48:49+01:00	(#bjjgk4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I do not think I have set up the admin user correctly. I need to check that. But yes - I should be the admin either way. The error I mentioned was on my development machine - not my VPS that I currently post from.
2023-02-22T22:05:44+01:00	(#bjjgk4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> got the admin stuff sorted on both now.
2023-02-22T22:10:15+01:00	(#bjjgk4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you.  What I did was to just pull the latest, build deps and the server, then enable the features as you mention through command line, as soon as I add activitypub it fails with that error when it starts up.
2023-02-22T22:41:08+01:00	(#bjjgk4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Running out of time for tonight, but I will test it tomorrow! :) I'll let you know how it goes tomorrow night.

2023-02-23T07:02:34+01:00	Good morning to you all!  The weather forecast says it'll be sunny for a week now, damn I'm looking forward to that, we've had a lot of rain this week.
2023-02-23T12:41:54+01:00	(#ouljz3a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Just a heads up - seems like your autocomplete or something is still using the nick I had at twtxt and not my new one :)
2023-02-23T19:03:30+01:00	@<reddit_world_news https://feeds.twtxt.net/Reddit_World_News/twtxt.txt> (#22akbja) Not good.
2023-02-23T21:37:48+01:00	Did this show up in the feediverse?
2023-02-23T21:49:35+01:00	(#wmw35xa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> are you testing that from another server? Do I make it discoverable by enabling the 'open profile' setting? or do you mean something else?
2023-02-23T21:53:43+01:00	(#wmw35xa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> can you give me your @user for your mastodon? I can then follow you there and see if that part works. I picked some random ones from fosstodon to follow, it said it followed successfully at least.
2023-02-23T21:54:30+01:00	(#wmw35xa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> I enabled that through the web ui admin panel now.
2023-02-23T21:57:07+01:00	(#wmw35xa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> ok. I'll check some more.
2023-02-23T21:58:57+01:00	(#wmw35xa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Try again now.
2023-02-23T22:01:02+01:00	So. this post should show up on mastodon! :)
2023-02-23T22:03:15+01:00	(#o4jkd4a) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Nice! Thank you so much!
2023-02-23T22:24:24+01:00	(#o4jkd4a) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> hehe! The cool thing is that it worked just fine on my VPS at least, so this is going to be nice! Yarn is by far my favorite social media, and even more now with the feediverse stuff that's coming along.
2023-02-24T07:17:17+01:00	Good morning to you all! Are you doing anything cool this weekend?
2023-02-24T08:36:15+01:00	(#as2w25a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Cool! :)
2023-02-24T18:17:20+01:00	I was supposed to travel this weekend (work), but in the end I did not need too. So now Ill enjoy the weekend at home :)
2023-02-25T11:21:40+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#dggklwa) great news! thank you so much! Ill upgrade asap.
2023-02-25T13:28:39+01:00	Started my day with a 10km hike with the dog this morning, was nice and quiet outside today, about 0c out, but sun was shining, so was really nice. Kids are busy today, so now I'm spending some time on my computer, which is nice. Been a very busy week, so I'm glad it's weekend now.
2023-02-25T14:23:28+01:00	I will try and write a small cli example project in rust, that will let you post a message on yarn through a server url. Once I have that - I will then try and write a client with GUI and all that. I have not used rust much - but I really want to learn it more. I usually stick with c++. Not sure how much time it'll take to get started, but I'll give it a try.
2023-02-25T19:42:05+01:00	@<retronav https://twtxt.net/user/retronav/twtxt.txt> (#yw7aouq) yeah, takes some time to adjust. got the ping request to work, currently working on auth stuff.
2023-02-25T20:31:42+01:00	(#yw7aouq) @<retronav https://twtxt.net/user/retronav/twtxt.txt>  I found this site: https://curlconverter.com/rust/ , makes it damn easy. Woho! Got the token now.
2023-02-25T21:40:45+01:00	Hello World from rust!
2023-02-25T22:17:13+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#36gcm7q) haha yeah! got the pieces I need now, so Ill start on a gui application with this now.
2023-02-26T08:37:23+01:00	(#yw7aouq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Correct! It'll be a generic yarn client. :)
2023-02-26T10:19:45+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#36gcm7q) got ping, login and posting to work through gui. next is fetching statuses and parse that into a nice list etc.
2023-02-26T19:59:07+01:00	Test from ftlk in rust.
2023-02-26T20:00:00+01:00	(#5jyltxa) Oh damn! That took a while, was a pain in the ass to get the json stuff working, but now it did! So now I get the token as json, fetch it and then use it when I created the post above! Woho!
2023-02-26T20:18:13+01:00	(#5jyltxa) The issue I had was the way the json library got the value, it included qoutes, which I do not want when I create the header info, and that is what took the most time to figure out how to solve, but not that works, which is nice! Next up is fetching statues and show them, and also a dynamic gui for posts.
2023-02-27T09:55:01+01:00	(#5jyltxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you. I'll work on fetching and parsing all the posts after work today. Looking forward to getting this into a working state.
2023-02-27T10:33:35+01:00	(#5jyltxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I'm sure all I need is there, the challenge is to set up the gui for it all - it's not always clear how to do it all for me (in rust), but I'm sure I'll get that stuff solved :) If I start something I work on it until it does what I need.  I might also switch to another gui library, I have to check out a bit more which one I feel is easiest to use for what I need.
2023-02-28T07:08:52+01:00	Heh, so now all the news sites in Norway is saying that 'covid leak from the lab is a plausible explanation', and 2 years ago you got banned all over the place for even asking if that was possible, and called this and that if you questioned this.
2023-02-28T11:52:55+01:00	@<screem https://twtxt.net/user/screem/twtxt.txt> (#emxpkzq) anything particular you are working on? :)
2023-02-28T12:56:14+01:00	@<screem https://twtxt.net/user/screem/twtxt.txt> (#emxpkzq) nice! keep going at it!
2023-02-28T18:21:52+01:00	the last days has been super busy, work, family, dog takes up most of my time (not that I complain). But I need to find some time for coding, so hopefully I can resume tonight for a couple of hours when kids has gone to sleep.
2023-03-01T07:30:33+01:00	Good morning to you all!
2023-03-01T17:33:49+01:00	@<reddit_world_news https://feeds.twtxt.net/Reddit_World_News/twtxt.txt> (#dtuupma) congrats! As a Norwegian this feels good!
2023-03-01T18:37:21+01:00	(#5jyltxa) Got the timeline, that was very easy to do, but now the harder part starts - wrap the timeline into a nice gui. This is where I need to put in some work now. Started on this today.
2023-03-01T19:15:11+01:00	(#5jyltxa) Also, I'm struggling a bit with some basic stuff, for example variables, does not work the same way as I'm used to with c++ it seems, so it's a bit confusing, re-using variables as input to several functions does not seem to be as straight forward as I'm used too - so I need to find some more info about stuff like that. Also the callback stuff for buttons and such is really weird to me. But I'll stick with it.
2023-03-01T19:22:57+01:00	(#5jyltxa) So - this is probably what I was looking for: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59814530/issue-with-string-using-in-multiple-functions
2023-03-02T07:26:19+01:00	Good morning to you all! Wish you a great day!
2023-03-02T07:59:16+01:00	(#6l57lza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ah man, that sounds nice! I do not drink - except that I have one cider during the summer vacation. (Always look forward to that one).  Other then that I love energy drinks, not that they help in any way - just tastes good :) I'm on my way to the office now shortly, ready for a new day with realtime 3D and coding.
2023-03-02T08:07:32+01:00	(#aac2l6q) The company I work work added a hybrid solution after covid restrictions lifted, we can work x amount of days a week from home.  Which was a great solution. Covid proved that everyone could work from home and still meet the project demands.  Personally I prefer the office, even if I have to be there alone (I worked for months alone there). But I also like the flexibility when I need it.
2023-03-02T09:06:06+01:00	(#6l57lza) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What I mean is '3D' that runs in realtime engine (like games etc) - and not 'offline' 3d (like animations etc), I work with simulators for oil industry.
2023-03-02T17:53:17+01:00	(#5jyltxa) okay, so all chores for today is done, so I have some time to code some more. I will resume my variable and functions adventure in Rust.
2023-03-02T21:18:43+01:00	(#5jyltxa) Found what I needed *finally*.. I now created a struct with this crate: https://crates.io/crates/arraystring That works for what I need, damn this has been annoying to find a solution too. I can now store the strings I need in the struct, and use that in all the functions. Also works with the GUI callback stuff, so it solves the Issue I've been having. I have now added gui elements for server url, username, password. And functions for fetching the timeline with the supplied info.  So now I can finally start working on the timeline GUI.  It's been in a way easier then expected, but also somethings are a bit tricky.  I could easily have done the same in c++ much faster, but the whole point here was to learn more rust. And for that it's been going well.
2023-03-03T07:27:46+01:00	(#5jyltxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I will most likely post something tonight. Right now its juts a window with 3 input textboxes and some button, nothing fancy at all. :)
2023-03-03T10:37:14+01:00	(#7h2xhoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, apparently it was a bit of old new (according to twitter), but still - looking forward to have a risc-v desktop system. :) Hopefully it'll not be too long until something like that hits the market with a price that I can pay for it. I do have 2 risk-v devices already, one mangopi (like a raspberrypi zero), and one HiFive1 Rev B (like a arduino). The Hifive rev B was a waste of time and money for me - but I bought it anyways, too 'embedded' for my liking, so not easy to make things work on that. The mangopi is perfect, got all my desktop stuff set up on that running debian.
2023-03-03T23:15:52+01:00	(#5jyltxa) Im very close to making the decision to just rewrite what I have in c++ instead. I feel I would have done this much faster with that. I'll think about it until tomorrow. I'll probably do that anyways just to see. just start with cmake and get started with it.
2023-03-04T09:35:25+01:00	(#5jyltxa) Okay, so I spent about one hour setting up cmake, fltk and libcurl for c++, got all that running now. I still need to fix the cmake script a bit, but I have a working verison now with this. I will now add the same curl stuff I had in rust in c++, then work on the gui and all that. So I will drop rust, and go for c++ instead, much easier for me. Was worth a try in rust, but for now that's not for me to be honest, I much faster and better in c++.
2023-03-04T13:36:45+01:00	(#77cpngq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you! And same to you! Was great talking with you. Haha, yeah, he is always ready for playtime or walks, haha.
2023-03-04T14:46:08+01:00	(#5jyltxa) So, progress is going smooth!  No I have compiled libcurl with openssl, and I fetch token already. so next is creating three functions - one for posting, one for the login and fetching token (now I have just testing login when application starts), and the fetch the timeline. Then I need the gui. Progressed faster in 2 hours in c++ then days with rust...
2023-03-04T14:57:20+01:00	(#5jyltxa) Ah, I forgot - first i need to add a json library, so I'll do that now.
2023-03-04T17:37:08+01:00	@<rrraksamam https://twtxt.net/user/rrraksamam/twtxt.txt> (#4e5bl4q) that's nice!
2023-03-04T17:54:42+01:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#tf4czmq) always nice to know stuff like that! one day it can save someone :)
2023-03-04T20:47:43+01:00	(#5jyltxa) Json parsing is done :) Now I can write the rest!
2023-03-05T09:54:32+01:00	(#kucudfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I do :)
2023-03-05T10:00:34+01:00	(#kucudfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'll do that right now.
2023-03-05T10:05:58+01:00	(#kucudfa) Done! :)
2023-03-05T12:38:55+01:00	my twitter feed blew up yesterday. I typically get some hundred views. but the post I did yesterday did get a lot of traction, lot's of replies and feedback etc.![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/x2avUbDTScbcWtYkR4oXok.png)
2023-03-05T19:21:10+01:00	Posting from c++, fltk GUI.
2023-03-05T19:35:18+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Next up is grabbing and showing the timeline, then all the other stuff needed. :) Was fast to get this up and running, and nice to end the weekend with this working.
2023-03-06T21:45:52+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Created the function that grabs the timeline. Now I have to plan a bit to make the actual gui for it, I think I might try and create my own custom fltk widget that I can feed with the json reply, and then it will set itself up based on that. Or maybe something simple at first - not sure yet.
2023-03-07T20:39:21+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Did some more work on the timeline stuff today, now I have added parsing of each status, so that I can get the data I need from each status (user, image url, text, links - all that stuff I need).
2023-03-08T09:30:29+01:00	Brrr, we had -12c this morning. But no clouds and sun is out. Nice day!
2023-03-08T20:14:12+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Working some more on timeline, trying to create a group widget and add label child widgets, those labels should then show the text for each status.
2023-03-08T20:24:06+01:00	(#6q26gaa) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> amazing view!
2023-03-09T09:55:11+01:00	How are you all doing today?
2023-03-09T10:51:13+01:00	(#ovghkta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ouch, does not sound good..  Hope you get better soon!
2023-03-09T21:24:55+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Okay, so it seems like the label\text I use for statuses does not like the strings from posts. Especially if they contain html tags and such (which the often do), it just breaks the text. I wonder what I can do with that.. I kinda want to not have html tags in the json reply. Have to think a bit about how to solve it. Took a while to figure it out, the text was just garbled. I created some long example strings with regular letters and such, to see if X number of posts would show up, and they did, but when I then replace my test strings with text from json - it goes all wrong again.
2023-03-09T21:31:39+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Okay, so was easier to solve (for now) then what I initially thought. First thing I found was this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49333136/removing-html-tags-from-a-string-of-text
2023-03-09T22:09:16+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) This one did the trick: `std::regex tags("<[^<]*>"); std::regex_replace(std::back_inserter(outputString), inputString.begin(), inputString.end(), tags, "");`
2023-03-09T22:54:38+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) I will work more on it this weekend. I hope to tidy it up enough for a screenshot 😀
2023-03-10T19:50:24+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) A lot of more work needs to be done, but at least now I got the basic timeline stuff done, took a good while to figure out how to solve it, but now I know. The reason why the statuses are cut short on some is because of html tags and stuff like that - c++ is a bit picky with strings and stuff like that. but I'll get that sorted as well.  At least I can show the first screenshot. Keep in mind the GUI is not at all finished, I'm working on the basics first, implement all the features, then I work on finishing touches.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/X9ktBGKpZ9LZ8YCZQjbsvK.png)
2023-03-10T20:54:56+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Soooo... Fltk uses @ symbol in strings to apply effects to text, now wonder I've been having issues with the timeline.. https://www.fltk.org/doc-2.0/html/group__symbols.html @ is used for mentions and all that stuff, so well - it just breaks the strings in the labels.
2023-03-10T20:56:29+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) So my status above looks like this in fltk because of the @  ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/xhusaw44jRZbLtkpbK9SPc.png)
2023-03-11T15:22:19+01:00	(#epgcnxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, that did not work well it seems.
2023-03-11T16:04:30+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Got some time for coding today, dog is resting a bit, and kids are busy. Today I'm resuming on the timeline, I'll see if I can fetch and show the avatars next to the statuses. And I'll see if I can get a reply button to work, also need to clean up stuff that I've done so far. A bit of duplicate stuff that can be simplified etc.
2023-03-11T16:19:20+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Oh, and also image upload needs to be done.
2023-03-11T16:28:18+01:00	(#zbsrabq) _And mostly whether it’s even a good idea at al, and if we should continue or not?_  I think that activitypub in yarn is a great feature! And also one of the easier ones to set up and get going. And as I said last week - I think it's a important features - and will drive adoption.  It is optional as well - so if one does not want it - just not turn that feature on.  I personally was missing the fact that I could not easily follow others before you added activitypub, but now I can choose to follow them, which is great.
2023-03-11T17:55:36+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Well, the code for getting and setting the avatar works. I need to align things better though. But cool that it works.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/N7cgKTXvr7Dxgxx7MHTNnF.png)
2023-03-14T08:49:08+01:00	(#7w2qk7q) Often people run a node somewhere, then connect to it with the remote node feature from other machines. Or use a light wallet. Cpu use will go down when block chain is synced. Also just a tip - check the prune blockchain feature to save a lot of space.
2023-03-14T08:59:45+01:00	(#ikhztpq) Just see the total hashrate on the network, then figure out how many cpu's you need to get over 51% of that rate - you then know what it would cost :) Also - nice to see a monero discussion, it's my fav cc. Also like it a lot because of the asic resistance that is built in.
2023-03-14T17:41:30+01:00	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> how? Monero + tor or i2p. Try and block that.
2023-03-14T17:53:18+01:00	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> anyone can run a exit node. Show me a case where a hidden service was taken over without regular investigation etc. The biggest darknet markets where taken down due to misconfigurations or mistakes leading them to leak IP and such , not because tor is compromised or that some agency ran a exit node.  A hidden service's traffic never goes through a exit node, only passes through middle nodes and everything stays encrypted.
2023-03-14T17:59:54+01:00	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> exit nodes and tor traffic that is contained within tor network is two separate things. And I do know what I'm talking about. I ran a exit node for a long time, rented vps in sweden, police raided there, then came at my door the next morning because someone sent  angela merkel a threatening  email through my exit node. Blocking exit nodes does not shut down hidden services because hidden service traffic never leaves the tor network.
2023-03-14T18:04:01+01:00	(#fupapta) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> and a lot of advancement has happened since 2015..
2023-03-14T18:45:45+01:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Keep us updated as you think about what to do about activitypub! :) Also - what ever you decide to do - I totally understand.
2023-03-14T19:34:21+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Working on things again today, made the timeline layout a bit better, now I'll work on the reply button, makes it more useful to use :)
2023-03-14T20:35:59+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) The reply button works from my application! I think it's really fun to work on this. Yarn's great API makes it fast to to develop for! :)
2023-03-15T11:30:29+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) I will spend a evening replacing the GUI library. FLTK is a pain when it comes to getting the strings the way I need them.  I think Ill try gtkmm or nanogui.
2023-03-16T18:55:10+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) I have cleaned up the timeline a bit, I like this much more. I use the markdown text now, instead of the 'text' field in the json file, looks much cleaner. I can work with this. One thing that I want to sort out next is the way the nicknames and url is shown. Also links in posts should be clickable - not sure if the current labels support that, but I'll try and figure it out somehow. Anyways - latest screenshot is attached here.. :)   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/ixFpyHERp7ujw7spMZ6bdd.png)
2023-03-16T23:27:30+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thank you!
2023-03-17T17:21:34+01:00	Weekend is here :)  I want to create a frontpage for my website - https://stigatle.no , fix cmake script for the desktop client and compile it on debian. Other then that I'll walk the dog as usual and spend quality time with my family. Going to be a great one :)
2023-03-17T21:13:58+01:00	Time to play some PUBG! :)
2023-03-18T09:58:15+01:00	Woke up early, got out and walked the dog, came home and our daughter had cleaned up her room, the kitchen and livingroom while I was out. She did that because I told her yesterday that I wanted to tidy up her room today. So she wanted to surprise me by doing all this today. That was really nice of her. :)

2023-03-22T19:12:13+01:00	(#ocbcqta) @<shreyan https://twtxt.net/user/shreyan/twtxt.txt> first time I've seen someone mention gnu taler. Been following it since it was announced:) never used for anything other then testing though.
2023-03-23T09:00:52+01:00	Good morning! Yet another rainy day in South Norway..
2023-03-24T08:30:00+01:00	Good morning to you all! Rain is still poring down, tired of getting wet each time I go outside. heh. Going to rain all weekend it seems, but then next week it'll get better. Hoped the rain would stop this weekend, but it seems like it wont.
2023-03-25T08:43:35+01:00	Beautiful spring day today, sun is out, it's warm. This is going to be really nice!
2023-03-25T11:07:49+01:00	Good morning!   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/kTRUGqowCKPj9kRcnyUp6T.png)
2023-03-25T11:18:50+01:00	(#lrpxyaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it was really nice! But also one of the more stressful walks, I had to turn back, because it was so slick on the rock that it was really hard to walk, and I fell once (that rarely happens), and when the dog was going to jump over a big gap in the rock on the trail he got scared, and pulled himself out of the harness and got some minutes of freedom.  There are sheep there too , so I got lucky that he did not go straight to them. Had some snacks in my pocket and got him back with that.
2023-03-25T14:14:33+01:00	(#lrpxyaa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> no, not ice, just really wet and really slick. Been raining a lot the last weeks. If it was dry it would be no problem.
2023-03-25T14:15:55+01:00	(#lrpxyaa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> haha yeah! Got out and bought a better harness for him now, the one he had was a size too big, so got a new one now so that it wont happen again.
2023-03-25T18:08:30+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Okay, so back at it today. I want to start and fix the text where nick and url is included, strip that away from the text being shown, makes the statuses much more cleaner. Also need to get started on clickable url's somehow.
2023-03-25T18:10:39+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Also- refresh of the timeline needs to be fixed.
2023-03-25T18:36:24+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) And threads would be nice to see as well, the list goes on and on :)
2023-03-25T19:54:56+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Timeline is cleaned up, so now I think I have that part sorted. Next is to refactor a bit and then fix so that the timeline refreshes properly. Once that is done I think I'll clean it up and upload the source somewhere and create tickets for outstanding known issues. Most likely upload it to github and continue the work there.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/mJRq4JNEQjFAH9N68xRHAb.png)
2023-03-25T22:29:41+01:00	Installed latest [Trisquel ](https://trisquel.info/) on one of my laptops, runs very well. I'll try and use this for all my daily stuff for a while, and see if it covers my needs :)
2023-03-25T23:00:26+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Also - did a quick test on linux, it gave a lot of errors with the rapidjson library, so I have to find a way to work around that. I think I'll pull the latest, then compile it - and then point to that - instead of installing the rapidjson-dev package. Maybe that'll work.
2023-03-25T23:00:57+01:00	(#l4cf3aa) @<osnews https://feeds.twtxt.net/osnews/twtxt.txt> Exciting laptop! I would not mind having one of these.
2023-03-25T23:41:37+01:00	(#qnd6ruq) Turns out the problem I had was also there when I build rapidjson from source, but if I moved the include to earlier (rapidjson in my project) - the problem went away, so I suspect it's the same as in [this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60445030/rapidjson-error-expected-unqualified-id-before-bool-when-building-for-linux-u) going on.  The cool thing is that the client now works fine on linux without changing anything else then the include order!  So now I'll do all development there - instead of on windows.
2023-03-26T11:29:40+02:00	(#qnd6ruq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thank you! Openbsd is also one of my target platforms. Want to have it in the ports tree there as well, but Ill get to that a bit later.
2023-03-26T20:13:58+02:00	(#qnd6ruq) Got the timeline to refresh, now I need to add a timer for that, but for now I'll just make a refresh button. It's not smart - so it grabs and adds the whole timeline again at this moment (but clears it first). Later I'll make it so that it only appends new statuses that are not already in the list. But feels good to have this sorted, makes it much more usable.
2023-03-27T17:35:07+02:00	(#quz4drq) @<reddit_world_news https://feeds.twtxt.net/Reddit_World_News/twtxt.txt> yay!
2023-03-28T07:28:43+02:00	oofff. Ive been on twitter for 15 years. But this right here is making me consider to just not be there anymore. Not cool that he'll do this, but not unexpected either.. The engagement I get on twitter is low enough already, but will tank after this if I do not pay for it.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/HVqR8Trjf2CkA7mfqj5a7X.png)
2023-03-28T08:20:10+02:00	(#qu22nmq) It sucks a bit. I'll probably keep my account, but not post there after that. I use my account mostly for tech stuff, and to keep up with the new things and stuff like that. I can still do that without paying, but I do not want to pay to get more views etc. So I'll just pin a post there - pointing to here instead after that goes active.
2023-03-29T11:14:03+02:00	Good morning to you all! How are you all doing today?
2023-04-01T10:07:11+02:00	The sun is out, no clouds, negative degrees, but beautiful day. Since we switched to summertime the dog sleeps an hour longer, which was great, finally got to sleep in.  Dog has been walked, kids are playing roblox together, later tonight we will have pizza and watch movie etc :) have a nice Saturday!
2023-04-01T13:27:12+02:00	(#zlaieqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yeah, no Microsoft account,I avoid that as best I can :)
2023-04-01T15:12:34+02:00	(#zlaieqq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yeah. I truly agree. I try to limit that as best I can. 👌
2023-04-01T16:23:10+02:00	(#qnd6ruq) Time to get back at it, I want to fix so that when you hit 'reply' it will also add any mentioned user in the reply.
2023-04-01T23:28:55+02:00	(#qnd6ruq) Been going back and forth on the gui, I will move away from FLTK and go for https://www.gtk.org/ instead. I'll spend tomorrow working on that. I need a more refreshing GUI then what I have now.  And also FLTK is a pain to get to work as I need - spend the whole afternoon trying to get it to use images (avatar etc) on my linux machine, and no matter what I've tried it refuses. So instead of wasting more time battling fltk I will switch to GTK.
2023-04-01T23:51:15+02:00	(#qnd6ruq) Got the cmake file updated, compiles and now it opens a GTK window, need to add the timeline and buttons that I had in FLTK, the other code related to parsing the statuses and all that is independent from the GUI so it'll be pretty quick to switch over once I have defined the new GUI elements.
2023-04-02T15:57:14+02:00	(#jpzwxoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I like it, I get to follow some people I could not follow before, which I find useful. But if you have second thoughts about it all - then I can understand that. If you decide to pull the plug on it - then I'll just get some additional activitypub service installed on my server and use that for that (I was thinking about installing this: https://github.com/tsileo/microblog.pub ) if needed.
2023-04-02T17:02:14+02:00	(#jpzwxoq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, it would be nice to actually follow the conversations that goes on, that would indeed make it feel more useful.
2023-04-02T21:16:42+02:00	(#qnd6ruq) Got some good progress on the GTK gui today, got the timeline to work! Took some time to figure out how the UI layout stuff works, but it looks good now. I will add the avatars next.   The way it is right now - I got this up and running in a couple of hours, instead of 'days' with FLTK. So I'm glad I made the decision to switch to GTK, Right now I'm doing all development on Trisquel OS, windows version will come later on.  Also - since I thought about the possibility that I wanted to switch early in the process  the code that does all the work is UI independent, meaning this was easy to do. +1 for planning ahead.. :) I will post a screenshot of the new UI soon, once it's a bit polished.
2023-04-03T22:07:11+02:00	(#ut55hfq) @<funbreaker https://yn.vern.cc/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt> Hi! I have attached the current screenshot, as you see it's not done yet, I need to add some things, but a lot of work is already done. I will fix the remaining things and try to make it usable enough this week so that I can upload the source. Need to add the remaining reply button, image loading and width of the text etc first. I had that in the FLTK client, so I just need to add it to this new GTK gui.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/wz92nfqXMwFu8AFrFsFrpS.png)   Here is what I had with FLTK  https://yarn.stigatle.no/twt/4nuoc7q  I did not have time to work on those things today, ran out of time. But I'll resume tomorrow.
2023-04-04T07:08:41+02:00	(#ut55hfq) @<funbreaker https://twtxt.net/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt> No worries, I'm just glad to see that someone likes what I spend my time on. Always fun to make something that someone else finds useful. I'll definitely get it into a usable state as soon as possible.
2023-04-04T19:17:20+02:00	Im going to fall a sleep standing up tonight it feels like. Holy shit I'm tired today. Just one more day then it's much needed vacation time.
2023-04-04T22:02:54+02:00	The GTK gui client is coming along nicely. Added avatar support, and reply button. It's pretty obvious that the GUI does not scale properly yet, but I'll worry about that once the last feature is added. Now I'm only missing the 'post status' gui, I need to think a bit about how I want that implemented. Anyways - here's the latest screenshot..   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/haUJkUecYs6kzzpckFTPyk.png)
2023-04-04T22:16:16+02:00	(#6c65zoq) Got the gui to scale properly with the window now, was easy to fix... Looks much better already!   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/aUkMa7SpefpmLx8dJxETAC.png)
2023-04-05T07:56:27+02:00	(#viqp5eq) @<chunkimo https://twtxt.net/user/chunkimo/twtxt.txt> Welcome!
2023-04-05T09:33:46+02:00	(#bxmk53q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  Refurbished thinkpad from ebay is also a good option.
2023-04-06T09:28:48+02:00	(#6c65zoq) @<chunkimo https://twtxt.net/user/chunkimo/twtxt.txt> thank you! Very pleased with it. I finally have vacation, got up early, took our dog for a long walk this morning, so now I can code a bit. I'll complete the status entry gui today, so that I can post statuses, after that I need to add a tomer for refreshing timeline, and then some way to store some settings.
2023-04-06T13:36:50+02:00	First test post from GTK UI!
2023-04-06T16:57:44+02:00	(#zajxjga) Reply button seems to work!
2023-04-06T19:35:22+02:00	(#zajxjga) Time for a new screenshot :)   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/NqW24h4UkgjkESmCAoeYdi.png)
2023-04-06T19:56:48+02:00	(#zajxjga) So glad I switched to GTK4, so much easier to work with then FLTK.
2023-04-07T10:30:49+02:00	(#zajxjga) Going out for a hike with the dog. Then I'll code a bit later today.  Want to fix the timeline refresh, and then create one timeline for each timeline, and buttons to switch between them.
2023-04-07T17:35:11+02:00	We went on a drive today, to another city, spent time at the seaside, eating ice-cream , walked the dog together, spent time on the playgrounds, weather was fantastic too, so was a really nice day today!
2023-04-07T18:33:34+02:00	(#p4zhpga) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Sounds like a really nice day!
2023-04-07T18:49:20+02:00	(#zajxjga) Need to rework the timeline a bit, I want it to append new statuses after refresh, right now it fetches the whole timeline and just inserts it as a whole. So I'll work on that alongside the refresh functionality.
2023-04-08T14:28:19+02:00	(#mk2jkiq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> They mention them at 2.5 admins podcast all the time, seems pretty good. I have not used it though. But all I hear there is positive things.
2023-04-08T16:04:47+02:00	(#zajxjga) Moving my source to git today, I have just developed on a local copy until today. I needed to move it before going too crazy with it. Starting the work on the timeline that I've mentioned. Yesterday I ran out of time, but today I have some free time to work on things. Very pleased with the software already, I know I'll use it all the time. So today I will work on refreshing the timeline, and then fix so that it's a bit smarter then now, the class that holds the statuses will also contain the GUI elements for each status, that way I can more easily append new statuses into the timeline - instead of grabbing the whole timeline and rebuild all it's gui each time it refreshes. I know what to do - so I do not expect it to take too long to fix.
2023-04-08T16:41:29+02:00	(#zajxjga) Also - I would like to know where you all like to have git hosted.. Github? Some other place? Do you mind self-hosted git servers? (I currently have my own).. What do you all prefer? Do you mind compiling software from source if instructions are clear and easy? Or do you prefer to download a released binary and run that?  I also later on (as soon as it's in usable state) want to make flatpack, appimage as well, that is something I have not done before - but I want to set that up as well.
2023-04-08T18:46:16+02:00	(#zajxjga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I agree with you points, and I feel the same. I currently run a gogs instance on my webserver, I'm putting my source there for now. Currently registrations are disabled and such, I'm the only user, that is the main issue I think - people need to register to submit a change. and I do not want people to register on my own git instance either, so I have to think about it a bit.
2023-04-08T19:17:56+02:00	(#zajxjga) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> We use gitlab daily at work. but for my own projects I use gogs. I have some scripts that I used for a gnusocial client that I maintained (before leaving gnusocial). I'll see if I can adapt that and make deb files for the yarn client - I mostly use debian \ Trisquel my self, so I also like .deb as well.
2023-04-08T23:08:08+02:00	(#zajxjga) Added refresh of the timeline, currently a button that you press to do so, I will move it to a timed function shortly.. But nice to get something added tonight.
2023-04-08T23:09:22+02:00	(#zajxjga) One thing I need to also fix - is the way a reply is done, I need it to add the mentions as well, so that you can reply to a person more easily, instead of just the thread.
2023-04-08T23:11:08+02:00	(#zajxjga) So now it looks like this:  ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/gvf3cERiadNRUuuDyZ6gaX.png)
2023-04-09T17:33:07+02:00	(#zajxjga) Progress - progress, love it when things fall into place.  If you hit 'reply' on a post it fills in the mentions as well in the status entry box.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/bzSK8w4F9hkeD9uvdPFEgK.png)
2023-04-09T19:03:30+02:00	(#zajxjga) I added all the timelines, so now you can switch between 'discover', 'timeline' and mentions from the drop down menu :)   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/UJSsrgF2g3TprdYaMZQMRo.png)
2023-04-09T21:13:29+02:00	(#zajxjga) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Thank you! Yeah I fixed that now, short statuses got shifted, but that has been fixed. :)
2023-04-10T12:52:42+02:00	(#zajxjga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thank you 😀
2023-04-10T21:17:36+02:00	(#zajxjga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, good point. I will see if I can selfhost it in a good way, I'll think about it for the next days, I'll also create a subdomain on my website where I can put some info and git links and what not, nice to have a info page to link back to from the application.
2023-04-10T21:20:44+02:00	(#zajxjga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it's mostly ready now I feel, got a lot done, so I'll focus on getting it out there this week, A bit busy the next days, but I'm sure I'll find time to get it uploaded and hosted on my VPS so that others can use it as well.
2023-04-10T21:24:58+02:00	(#2dlcg3a) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Dragonfly BSD - that is one OS I have never run properly before - but I've always wanted too. Also not often at all I see that OS being mentioned 'in the wild'.
2023-04-10T21:51:20+02:00	(#2dlcg3a) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> Nothing really, I tried it in a VM a long time ago, never got to install it on HW, might give it a try again soon (I enjoy to set up my machines with various OS'es and test them etc).

But one of the most prized computers I have is the Lemote Yeeloong, Loongson mipsel laptop - http://web.archive.org/web/20151220055337/http://www.lemote.com:80/en/products/Notebook/2010/0310/112.html , very cool machine, I cannot part with that one, gonna put in in my coffin when I die. Got a hold of it about 10 years ago, cost a lot, but it was worth it.  I run openbsd on it, and have to compile everything on it. took over 2 weeks to compile sylpheed email client on it LOL.
2023-04-12T08:45:16+02:00	(#chce3xq) @<eldersnake https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> indeed, that is how I learned about that machine :)

2023-04-13T21:20:31+02:00	(#jpdfs4q) @<phoronix https://feeds.twtxt.net/phoronix/twtxt.txt> nice! I want to upgrade on my x200 soon.
2023-04-14T07:26:00+02:00	Good morning, wish you all a nice Friday!
2023-04-14T21:28:25+02:00	Got up before 7 this morning, now it's 14,5 hours later - and I finally got to sit down for the first time today. Been a busy day, but a good one. Now it's time to relax a bit (code on the desktop client) and then relax for a bit. Tomorrow the weather is going to suck, but I'll still go for the usual weekend hikes with the dog, trying to plan a new place to walk tomorrow.
2023-04-15T11:32:34+02:00	Good morning to you all! Started my day by walking about 5km around a lake that's next to the ocean, a really nice place to walk. It rains today, so not many people out (which I like). So now the dog is sleeping on the sofa. My daughter went to a friend for a visit today, and my son is just chilling and watching youtube. So it's a nice chill start to this Saturday :) Hope you all have a great day!
2023-04-15T11:48:15+02:00	(#l6viaiq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That sounds great! I'm looking forward to doing that too here! We also go to the local lakes and such when it gets warm enough! Always nice to spend time in the water :)
2023-04-15T12:12:27+02:00	I will release the sourcecode for the desktop client tonight. I will put it on github (sorry to anyone who prefer other places), but the reason is that I do not want my own git to be open for public. So I'll put it on github where I have all my other public projects. I have to write the readme, then add some info on the login page (link to source etc), then it's ready to release with the current features. I then hope others will give it a try and use it if they want :) I also have many other features I need to implement, but all the main features that makes it usable has been implemented, so I'm very pleased with it (And I use it all the time now).
2023-04-15T12:20:17+02:00	(#l6viaiq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> By the way - can I call my application 'Yarn desktop client'? Is that OK with you? Or do you want it to have another name - but then have 'a desktop client for yarn' as information in readme etc?
2023-04-15T13:03:16+02:00	(#l6viaiq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Great! Thank you!
2023-04-15T13:27:09+02:00	(#2iadw7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> hehe, yeah! That's the way to get things done - use it daily, fix everything that needs to be fixed :)
2023-04-15T13:33:34+02:00	(#2iadw7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I will give it a shot today, that and to show attached images in the status would be great to have.  I just need to figure out the curl for posting image, then the rest would be easy to implement :) I would use that a lot since I often post photos and such.
2023-04-15T14:33:33+02:00	The code for the desktop client is now public here: https://github.com/stig-atle/YarnDesktopClient , I will create tickets for the known things I need to fix and such later today.
2023-04-15T14:47:16+02:00	(#qazcfgq) If anyone of you pulls the code and compiles it - then please let me know :)
2023-04-15T18:40:37+02:00	Baking pizza tonight! Pepperoni pizza, yummy!
2023-04-15T20:38:06+02:00	(#qazcfgq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> valid points and noted. 😀 It will improve shortly. I had not thought about quotes in password, so that was a nice catch that needs to be fixed.
2023-04-15T21:03:56+02:00	(#qazcfgq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Also - I agree with the rest of what you say. I just have a habit of making stuff work, then improve, but what you mention is somethig I need to be better at doing from the start, so I'm glad you mention these things. Also - the TLS check - it refused to connect if I have it enabled, and from what I saw online you need a copy of the servers cert locally to have that enabled, that's at least what I found when I looked into it, but it's worth a second look for sure. Pizza was great today, i'm stuffed! :)
2023-04-15T23:56:28+02:00	(#bac4dta) @<funbreaker https://twtxt.net/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt> cool! Can you launch through terminal and check if it outputs the problem?
2023-04-16T00:04:30+02:00	(#bac4dta) @<funbreaker https://twtxt.net/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt> okay, so something goes wrong in the response you get. Hm. I see you use twtxt, ill check against there tomorrow and see if I can find the issue (midnight here now).  Also ill work on better error output as well when I find the problem. Thank you for testing!
2023-04-16T00:13:30+02:00	(#bac4dta) @<funbreaker https://twtxt.net/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt> yeah, that can be a issue. I will check some of these things tomorrow :)
2023-04-16T00:15:28+02:00	(#bac4dta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes I will test it :) cloudflare is something I do not have on my end, so I never thought of that, so glad you mention that as a potential issue to solve. Ill check on it.
2023-04-16T01:11:56+02:00	(#gjst6xa) Huh? Not sure what you are referring to here to be honest.
2023-04-16T09:56:43+02:00	(#mbfz2ya) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thank you, found that as well. Had a read, and well.. behavior like that is not easy to deal with.

I will add a 'enable ssl verification' checkbox (checked by default) so that those who do not need or want it for testing and such can disable it if they want.
2023-04-16T13:09:58+02:00	(#bac4dta) @<funbreaker https://twtxt.net/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt> Could you pull the latest code and rebuild? I have added SSL verification now. If it still fails I'll make a twtxt account and look into it more.
2023-04-16T14:31:06+02:00	(#qazcfgq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> thanks again! I'll get those things sorted.
2023-04-16T17:27:08+02:00	(#eovso7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> haha yeah. I had a good laugh from that.

2023-04-16T21:58:04+02:00	(#bac4dta) @<funbreaker https://twtxt.net/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt> seems to be related to the way the timeline array is done. I will rewrite that part. I'll start tomorrow.
2023-04-17T06:58:34+02:00	(#twokwia) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> no, its on my end.
2023-04-17T16:08:52+02:00	15 degrees + today, feels like summer. Gonna chill all day outside today and enjoy the nice weather :)
2023-04-17T18:17:58+02:00	(#bac4dta) @<funbreaker https://twtxt.net/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt> I have pushed a fix now to git, I now got rid of the error when I use it on my end. I will create a test account on twtxt later tonight (after dinner and all that) if needed. If you test the latest on your end before that - let me know :) And thanks for your patience.
2023-04-17T18:35:45+02:00	(#bac4dta) @<funbreaker https://twtxt.net/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt> Also, did you compile rapidjson from source? Or install the package with your OS? I built the latest version and installed that - if the problem continues now after I fixed the error on my end - then that might be the cause.
2023-04-17T21:34:05+02:00	(#bac4dta) @<funbreaker https://twtxt.net/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt> I tested now against twtxt with a account I created -it segfaulted if you had a / at the end of the server url.. My bad.. works if you remove the slash. I will fix it in the client so that it removes the slash if it's in the server url.
2023-04-17T22:01:32+02:00	(#bac4dta) @<funbreaker https://twtxt.net/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt> no need to feel dumb. This is why testing is nice! That being said - ill make a fix for that too :) this is why I appreciate you taking the time to test, because we have now found many things to improve already 😀

2023-04-21T21:47:35+02:00	How are you all doing tonight?
2023-04-22T00:32:06+02:00	(#wsm22pq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Woho! Good to hear!
2023-04-22T00:33:16+02:00	Had to add all my crypto to my taxes, damn that is a painful process. There are online services that helps with that part, so I use that to help. but I have transactions all over the place, so it takes a lot of time. But now it's done for this years tax report :)
2023-04-22T00:55:16+02:00	(#gmtjxea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yeah. Everything else on my taxes are already folled in. For crypto you need to add each and every transaction. The online service I use has api to each major exchange, pulls the data and crunches the numbers for you though. The problems start when you use decentralised exchanges or unsupported wallets etc. Took some hours to sort out on my end. But now I do not have to worry about it. 😀
2023-04-22T08:27:33+02:00	(#gmtjxea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The one I actually use for something is Monero. I also mine it (asic resistant, mined with cpu). The others I just put some savings in every month. The whole pyramid scheme thing - I do not think much about honestly. Crypto is here to stay, won't go away. And for me it's better then stocks because I know nothing about stocks and such. I do not put much into it. I also had some NFT stuff that I minted - which I sold for 10x the price later on, but honestly - last year I gained as much as I lost, so it evened out to almost 0.
2023-04-22T09:53:12+02:00	(#gmtjxea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> The good thing here at least is that you get back on your taxes if you loose money, so that helps a bit, and if you buy mining gear you can write some of the cost up as well etc. So it's a pretty nice that they have done it that way here. The only downside is what I mentioned already - the complexity of filing it all.
2023-04-22T21:10:36+02:00	(#mg5qhuq) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Yeah, that seems to be the case :)
2023-04-22T21:12:29+02:00	(#mg5qhuq) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Been thinking about leaving twitter recently, so much drama there. But I have not decided yet. It's still a bit useful for me for getting my tech related news stuff and things like that, so I cannot get my self to leave yet.
2023-04-22T21:33:33+02:00	(#mg5qhuq) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I keep my account too - do not want to get rid of it, but I do not post much anymore there at all, just retweet stuff I find interresting.  Also I'm so boring there that I get almost no followers and such, never got any traction there, even though I've been there since 2008. I write more here then there, and get more response here as well.
2023-04-23T13:34:53+02:00	Working on showing attached images in the desktop client, it worked on first try.  Now I need to fix the scale and alignment - but cool that it works already!   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/TxiWiFoa3ogUd7UyLCYC7K.png)
2023-04-23T20:55:04+02:00	Got a really nice chain from my stepdad today, gonna rig it up in the garden so that the dog can be there as much as he wants without me worrying about him jumping the fence.
2023-04-24T08:08:19+02:00	(#fwjro5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> They have some markdown support that you can use, but I have not looked into that yet, I might check on that for clickable links in label. I now just get all the attached links in each post, check for direct links to images, download them and show them as in the screenshot.
2023-04-25T20:12:29+02:00	(#fwjro5a) Gonna code a bit tonight. Clean up the image code, then I will rewrite some of the code that uses libcurl, make a more generic function that I use in the calls, instead of many functions. That will be nice.
2023-04-26T21:40:47+02:00	(#jofuwcq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Hope you get some time to relax :)
2023-04-27T08:18:22+02:00	Have a nice day everyone!
2023-04-27T20:11:33+02:00	Been a really nice day today. Just one more day at the office then it's a long weekend (We have Monday off work). Looking forward to that!
2023-04-28T07:54:01+02:00	(#hylyega) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> That sounds nice! This weekend we're going to celebrate my grandmother's birthday (80) and my stepdad's birthday (50). So it'll be a lot of cake this weekend :)

2023-04-29T19:35:29+02:00	Back home again, had a really nice time today, was about a 6hr drive (3hrs each way), so it's good to be back home. Was really nice to see grandma today (and the other family members that where there). Now we're baking pizza! Time to relax :)
2023-04-29T20:11:06+02:00	I need to add  'thread view' in the Yarn desktop client, I find my self really missing that when I use it. It will make it much easier to follow threads and such.
2023-04-30T20:41:52+02:00	Worked a bit on the desktop client tonight, now I store username/pass/server url, but it's insecure at the moment. I need to find a way to store it more securely.
2023-04-30T20:53:01+02:00	(#yejw3uq) One thing I did in another project was to use sqlite that had encryption. I might do that here as well. That would work well for this.

2023-05-12T22:58:32+02:00	I have not used AI much at all, I have not paid any attention to it. But today I decided to give stablediffusion a test run, I do only have a 1080 card, so it took some tweaking to output 512x256 images, and I must say it works pretty well. I also had to get one of the memory optimized versions. Fun to test.
2023-05-13T08:19:49+02:00	(#hwcni7a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> by helping building it up. Positive reinforcement:)  Takes a lot of time..
2023-05-14T19:33:27+02:00	Decided to pick up my ipad again, I have one of those keyboards for it, as well as a bluetooth mouse, RDP to other machine works really well. A bit surprised about how well it works actually. I often use one of my older laptops and remote into my workstation, but this is a much nicer solution. :)
2023-05-15T08:44:01+02:00	Just 2 days at the office this week, then rest of the week is free time :) woho!
2023-05-16T07:28:38+02:00	Wish you all a great day!
2023-05-18T21:43:55+02:00	Scrollwheel on bluetooth mouse on ipad does not work in goryon. Other then that it works great! But you can use mouseclick and move the timeline as you do with touch, so its not a big deal.
2023-05-19T17:32:51+02:00	Been some busy days this week, even though I have some time off now. Today me and Marlyn had some time for ourselves - and her mother watched our kids, so we went out to eat at a resturant, which we very rarely do, was nice to do that. I had some nachos, was really nice. Also bought one of those popcorn machines for our kids, because they always burn the microwave popcorn (not their fault - its the microwave thas weird), so now they can safely make popcorn :)
2023-05-21T11:09:47+02:00	I want to try NixOS again, and then get the yarn desktop client built on that, and then see if I can get the client into their repo. That would be fun to do. If I have time tonight I'll start on that.
2023-05-21T11:12:05+02:00	(#mq5inwa) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> not much, enjoying time off work and family time :)
2023-05-21T15:26:27+02:00	We had a wonderful day by the ocean today.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/ExaVCXfpqgApKMQVMBeGmf.png)
2023-05-23T15:53:09+02:00	(#wuxzspa) So, I kinda regret installing NixOS, I had forgotten why I did not use it for c++ stuff last time. But I learned about 'flakes' so Im checking into that now to see if I can use that to my advantage to make it easier. So I'll give it some more time to see if I can learn what I need to build yarn desktop client on it.
2023-05-23T19:55:40+02:00	(#wuxzspa) Heh, I do not regret it anymore, I was able to create a flake.nix file that builds the desktop client on NixOS. But I now found a bug with keyring access that I need to fix. but the client compiles and starts. It does not open the keyring - so it hangs and waits and you need to kill it. On my previous machine the keyring got opened at login by another application.
2023-05-23T19:58:25+02:00	(#wuxzspa) Here is a screenshot showing the client running on NixOS.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/J5EFGGuZ3kmJXSgGKzKGPH.png)
2023-05-24T16:36:51+02:00	(#wuxzspa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you! Now I just need to get it running on OpenBSD 😀
2023-05-25T19:00:19+02:00	I need to add multithreading to the desktop client, I have not done that before in c++ - so that'll be fun to figure out. I need it for the fetching of the timeline so that it happens in a separate thread. That way the GUI does not freeze while fetching the timeline. Also need to add a status bar that can show what the application is working on.
2023-05-25T19:59:26+02:00	(#t5k7k3a) Also, got almost everything I use up and running on NixOS, last thing I need now is a way to develop directly on my source, I think I need to set up one of those development shell files for it, so that I then can work from vscode or kdevelop. Cmake is currently happy, and I tried to install everything on my system, but the 'nix build' works fine - but that pulls from remote repo, I want to compile the local edited source as I work on it.
2023-05-25T20:01:24+02:00	(#t5k7k3a) GTK4 libraries are not detected by cmake, even though I have it installed on my system. I've googled a bit - and others have solved it a bit differently. So I'll try a couple of things to see if I can get it to work.
2023-05-25T20:43:10+02:00	(#t5k7k3a) I was able to fix this now, by making a 'default.nix' file, and then you can open a shell that has all the stuff needed by simply typing 'nix-shell' in the root git directory. Pretty nice, I'm starting to enjoy this OS more and more.
2023-05-25T20:55:23+02:00	(#t5k7k3a) Also - the last thing I needed is sorted, how to get vs code to pick up the default.nix shell environment, there is a really nice addon for vs code that picks up what is in that file, and then set up the environment based on that, meaning I can now open the source, configure, compile and debug with vscode, this was the last piece that was missing. I will write a blog post on my website that explain what I learned, and how I fixed all these things, maybe it'll help someone else to try NixOS for some development.
2023-05-26T16:24:03+02:00	We have Monday off work again, going to be super nice with a long weekend again! :)
2023-05-29T22:33:16+02:00	I tested the yarn desktop client on wsl2 on windows 11, compiled and ran just fine there. Nice to have linux applications with gui on windows.
2023-05-30T20:11:19+02:00	Time to dive into threading and c++. I will start with making the file/image downloader threaded, then I'll make the timeline fetching and all that threaded as well.
2023-06-01T08:54:09+02:00	Have a great day everyone!
2023-06-01T16:30:29+02:00	(#xa73jea) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I use spideroak backup, and switched from selfhosted nextcloud to proton drive.
2023-06-01T16:52:52+02:00	I have to admit I'm very impressed with wsl2, they have done a damn good job on that. Makes it very easy to develop linux stuff on windows when needed. And removes the need for virtual machine or dualbooting etc. Also they have done a really good job integrating it with vscode.
2023-06-01T22:29:54+02:00	(#et2ea3a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> they have some info about it in their faq. I have to check into that some more.
2023-06-03T18:15:27+02:00	We had a really nice day today, dog woke up early (as he always does during the weekend), and I went for a walk in the forest while the rest of the house got to sleep some extra. When I got back we went to a fleamarket, and then we went to a farmersmarket in town, was really nice, and tons of things to see :) And a bit later today we'll have nachos, and I spend some time on my computer. Currently coding a bit.
2023-06-04T00:00:27+02:00	Hehe, as you all might have noticed - I test OS'es often. NixOS was too much of a pain to work efficiently in (the way I wanted), so hopped over to Fedora now. Got all my stuff working there now, as well as the desktop client. I really like how portable the code is, and how easy it is to compile on different os'es. Installed fedora with LXQT, I really like that desktop, I do not like gnome at all - I really dislike the way gnome works. LXQT is just what I need.
2023-06-04T08:39:02+02:00	(#ladlhja) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Oh yes! That one is really nice! I have it on my to-buy list :)
2023-06-04T13:46:29+02:00	(#ladlhja) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> i have the mangopi riscv, works well, but I will get this new milkv here next. I have not seen that nanopi before, cool! Always fun with new stuff :)
2023-06-05T19:05:27+02:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#6u6pota) very nice! we've got super nice weather, warm, no clouds. today we've been outside all day, and fired up the barbecue.
2023-06-07T07:34:52+02:00	(#k5eii3q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I think the problem is that NATO does not want to get directly involved, because that scales up everything. So they provide with the things they can to help instead. It worries me a bit (even though I live in the South of Norway - and Russia borders in the north), but it helps a lot that we have Sweden and Finland next to us. But if shit hits the fan - then it won't be easy to get anywhere from here, unless we steal a boat and go to England or something like that (or get on a plane). I try not to worry, but it's in the back of  my mind still.. But we have talked about it in my family, and if things happen then we have a plan on what to do first.
2023-06-07T07:36:02+02:00	(#k5eii3q) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I agree with you on this, and find it crazy that he's not been stopped yet.
2023-06-07T10:17:29+02:00	I wonder when they will show a UAP\UFO in physical form to everyone. So much talk about it - but no physical evidence is shown. I have no doubt that tech like that exists somewhere in the universe - it's not unlikely at all. Just think about the tech advancement the last 200 years, and then what if there exists others that are 1 million years beyond our timeline.
2023-06-07T17:57:08+02:00	@<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> (#k5eii3q) yeah, I see your point. but it's sad to say it's better witha blown nuclear reactor the nuke bombs being dropped around. But yeah, hope this shit ends soon. we do not notice it here at all, but the military is ramping up in the north, which is good, and much needed.
2023-06-07T21:04:57+02:00	@<shreyan https://me.shreyanjain.net/tw.txt> (#nwucftq) crazy price.
2023-06-12T20:15:42+02:00	we went to the beach today, straight from work. was really nice, and water was great too! really nice day! our kids had a really nice time, and dog too :)
2023-06-12T20:22:21+02:00	wanted to use my oculus to do some flightsimming on Friday, but now Meta forces you over to facebook. super annoying message that constantly pops up in the desktop client, but then after 10 minutes of flying they show the same message in fullscreen inside the VR glasses. so fuck them. I will try and get it to work on linux instead one day soon when I have time.
2023-06-12T22:03:43+02:00	@<osnews https://feeds.twtxt.net/osnews/twtxt.txt> (#wlvkwpq) that's nice! I have to give this release a try!
2023-06-16T21:41:58+02:00	Hope you all are doing well! we're enjoying the heatwave that has hit us. :)
2023-06-17T17:51:38+02:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#qqefk2a) that sounds nice! we have the same temp, maybe a bit higher. there is clouds today, but the heat is still there. and half of Norway has thunder and lightning (but not where we are yet).
2023-06-17T17:54:50+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#qqefk2a) thank you! I got started on some 3D stuff this morning, we then went to the candy store to get some candy, tonight well have that, and nachos + a movie.  and the rest of the day we have been outside :)  here is what I got started on this morning : ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/bbEnmmUMSKZd2jawEqP66X.png) just testing some ocean stuff.
2023-06-18T12:19:32+02:00	(#qqefk2a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yeah, same here, been no rain here. But honestly - I do not mind warm weather and such, but I also appreciate a bit colder. We'll have some rain next week I think.
2023-06-18T12:20:50+02:00	(#qqefk2a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I work with 3D and code at work every day, so I very rarely make 3D at home, but for the first time in a looooong time I felt like making something. I like the technical parts of it, setting up simulations, tinker with advanced materials and such things.
2023-06-18T12:21:31+02:00	Today our daughter has invited her friends over to celebrate her birthday in advance, so we're spending time doing that today :) Going to be a nice day!
2023-06-19T18:39:46+02:00	@<reddit_world_news https://feeds.twtxt.net/Reddit_World_News/twtxt.txt> (#qqggdpa) that must suck. to be stuck down there. wonder what went wrong.
2023-06-21T09:16:17+02:00	(#mgxsyia) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Thanks! It was really nice! They had a great time! And it was warm, but we filled the pool we have at our terrace, and they got to hang out there. Her actual birthday is tomorrow, so I'm really looking forward to celebrate it! She will get the gift from us that she really wanted  so that'll be nice!
2023-06-21T09:28:08+02:00	(#qqefk2a) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> We have some rain now, yesterday too, temp dropped 12c or something like that. Feels a bit refreshing :)
2023-06-21T12:18:08+02:00	Just ordered a new phone, making the switch from Samsung Android to Iphone.  Been a while since I've been excited about getting a new phone. Looking forward to it!
2023-06-21T16:42:02+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#iyqf5wa) it'll be nice to get away from google for a while. also moved all my cloud files to proton drive (got tired of self-hosting). I want a mac too, the m2 laptop. But that will be later. but Im unsure how software development is done on it, if its easy to for example code your own stuff (c++), and also I have no idea how gui realted things are handled. but that makes it fun as well - figuring out all that stuff.
2023-06-21T18:59:20+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#iyqf5wa) ah okay. that sounds like the way to do it.

2023-07-02T00:02:13+02:00	This whole twitter thing got me motivated to code on the yarn desktop client. Currently working on adding support for links in the post, so that you can open and view the links that are in the statuses.

2023-07-03T20:52:05+02:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#r7l3hvq) not much there anyways, and if it provides jobs and crestes a industry then thats good. also miningrules are strict in Norway, so its better then getting it from some 3rd world country with few regulations etc.

2023-07-09T20:52:10+02:00	I had issues with the current activitypub implementation here on yarn (people could not follow me properly) and I cannot see their posts and stuff like that, so I decided to host activitypub separate from here.  So I will turn it off here - and use this site has as before - but without activitypub turned on, and then do all my activitypub stuff over on that other service.  I can be added through: @<stigatle https://activitypub.stigatle.no/stigatle>  This does not affect the development of the desktop client, I will still work on that, I'm here to stay :) I just need a way to follow the others properly on the other services..  I did not want to join mastodon, and I did not want something complex to host, so I decided to set up Snac2 - https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2 . It's super lightweight, easy to set up, and worked out of the box for what I was looking for.
2023-07-10T11:20:02+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#p244zzq) no worries :) and as you know I appreciate the work you put into it!

2023-07-10T22:50:32+02:00	@<reddit_world_news https://feeds.twtxt.net/Reddit_World_News/twtxt.txt> (#ib4igkq) Finally.
2023-07-11T18:43:18+02:00	(#2id47na) I understand your thoughts on this, but I would not call it a failure - because you learned a lot from it, and lots of things worked as well. And there are alternatives for those who needs\wants activitypub, so I think also yarn\twtxt benefits from you focusing on that instead of dealing with the frustrations of activitypub integration. And maybe it'll feel a bit better to put that on the backburner? :)
2023-07-11T22:43:18+02:00	@<phoronix https://feeds.twtxt.net/phoronix/twtxt.txt> (#pczh3qa) looks really good!
2023-07-12T18:08:42+02:00	Came across a twitter post claiming that there is a UFO in a building, meaning the ufo crashed, and then the building was built to cover it.  The tweets are here: https://twitter.com/realityseaker/status/1677744254918049794 and here: https://twitter.com/UAPodcast850/status/1678855434705182721  I wish it was true, but I have doubts about it. It's easy enough to find the building on google maps:  https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B024'48.5%22N+126%C2%B055'44.4%22E/@37.4134617,126.9264272,572m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d37.4134617!4d126.9290021!5m1!1e4?entry=ttu  And if you zoom out you see that it's not even remote. So a UFO crash here without any pictures \ videos is extremely unlikely.  Also, the antenna on the roof got me thinking, I've seen that before, and that is where I often walk our dog, see here:  https://www.google.com/maps/@58.0845749,7.9084282,63m/data=!3m1!1e3!5m1!1e4?entry=ttu
2023-07-12T18:08:50+02:00	(#ked6b4q) It's the same type of antenna on both buildings, all though one is a actual building, and the other is just the antenna with a smaller building under the mesh structure. I often fly flightsims, its my hobby, so I often work with waypoints, so I now just looked up the waypoint to find it's information, to do that I looked up the closes airport, then looked around until I found the waypoint: https://opennav.com/navaid/KR/SEL/ANYANG  So would they really place a navaid on a building that contains a UFO? I do not think so. Would a UFO crash that close to Seoul without a since photo or video? I do not think so either.
2023-07-12T21:40:09+02:00	@<linux_gizmos https://feeds.twtxt.net/linux_gizmos/twtxt.txt> (#fd66ubq) very nice! I think I have to get this one!
2023-07-13T22:55:12+02:00	Today one crypto I invested in went up over 70%, the other 20%. The bank I have fucks us over with the current economy, and earns record amounts for themselves. This is why I put savings in crypto and not in the bank. Im not trying to come across as a cryptobro or anything like that with this post (I rarely write about it).
2023-07-14T10:16:00+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#4mcn4pq) haha, money goes out fast. but its nice too see some savings grow a bit.

2023-07-15T16:48:52+02:00	(#pne2f3a) Yeah, that would be nice! At least when you think about the way things are going these days..
2023-07-16T20:42:06+02:00	Just compiled the Yarn desktop client on OpenSuse, was no issues getting it to run there, I love how portable it is. I initially wanted to run OpenBSD on this laptop, but it would not detect wifi, which is a dealbreaker for me, so I installed OpenSuse tumbleweed instead, and will run OpenBSD in a VM and try from there instead.

2023-07-19T13:32:29+02:00	I need to do a big rewrite on how the yarn desktop client handles the status widgets, this is because I want links and such, and to do that I have to rewrite the status message code, it takes a bit if time to do it, but I kinda know what to do - I just need to dive in and get it done. Been thinking about it for a while, I think it's time to get started on it. Also makes the code much cleaner then what it is now.
2023-07-19T13:45:41+02:00	(#bphoq2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think the API is is fine :). But to be honest - one thing that would help me is a commandline curl example on how to upload a image, I take these curl commands through a converter that makes it into libcurl c++ code which I then use :) If you could help me with such a image upload curl example then I'd appreciate it! (I'm currently missing media upload).. And having that feature would be great! :)

2023-07-23T23:50:46+02:00	@<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> (#vkd345q) quite long, boat pulled us up to over 1000m, then we disconnected the rope and glided along the mountain ridges. was really nice. the view was amazing. the boat was on the lake I posted earlier.
2023-07-24T15:41:02+02:00	we just came home from a weekend of fun! we’re all tired now, time to relax a bit :) hope you all had a great weekend too!
2023-07-24T19:10:01+02:00	Russia attacks 200m from Nato border, you think Nato would react if the attack went 1 meter over the border?.. Or would they just come with excuses on why not to intervene?
2023-07-24T20:44:00+02:00	(#vkd345q) Here is the takeoff and landing. The rope is quite thin, just about a shoestring, like parachute cord. You can see it in the video.   https://activitypub.stigatle.no/stigatle/p/1690143523.819668 https://activitypub.stigatle.no/stigatle/p/1690143474.932679

2023-07-25T20:13:55+02:00	(#klgplgq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Luckily my father has a van, so I was able to get rid of it all in two trips to the dump.
2023-07-26T11:38:26+02:00	Went out with our husky this morning for some playtime, had one of the long lines on him and throw ball, the long line hook snapped, and luckily we have trained a lot on recall so he came straight back. Then went and got a more robust long line. I started doing this instead of longer walks when he wakes up. He uses up more energy playing then walking, so he is more relaxed afterwards.

2023-07-28T12:13:18+02:00	(#yof33qq) it was amazing. we all went on a roadtrip with some friends. kids had a nice time, lots of stuff for them to do. about 7hrs driving, stopping all over the place to look at the scenery and eat food, swim etc. was really nice.
2023-07-30T00:05:51+02:00	compiled and ran the desktop client on riscv tonight. my mangopi only has 512mb ram, but it was enough to compile and run it :)
2023-07-30T16:13:34+02:00	(#utpbpea) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I have to admit it was not useable in any way, since it (along with the OS) used almost all the ram, and the mangopi is not a powerfull device, works fine for terminal and file browsing \ editing etc, but not much more. Still waiting to get my hands on some better riscv hardware.
2023-07-30T17:34:01+02:00	(#a7rz2ja) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Hahaha, I remember this type of scanner. We had one of those as well.
2023-07-30T21:21:47+02:00	(#r63zi7a) @<rrraksamam https://twtxt.net/user/rrraksamam/twtxt.txt> I honestly dislike web3 platforms, and especially blockchain social media. It's just filled with people trying to make a dollar. That is always the focus on those blockchain based social media sites. I like what I can host my self, no money or tokens \ crypto involved etc.  Tried nostr for a while, but I cannot get into that either. Only reason it's popular is because of jack (that's just my opinion), and they are always pushing bitcoin lightning network there - and I get tired of that pretty fast.
2023-07-30T22:35:18+02:00	(#dndgwsq) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> I invest in crypto, I use it to pay for various services too, I focus mainly on monero due to it's privacy features - which I like. For me it's a way of saving and investing. I do not have much in there - but more saved there then in the bank. Cryptocurrencies are definitely useful, in many ways. Crypto is here to stay. What I dislike is the whole web3 'pay to play' kinda thing..
2023-07-31T10:11:03+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#r7csyya) thanks! I have not had time to look into it myself either. been busy days.
2023-08-01T00:05:39+02:00	today Its my 40th birtday :)
2023-08-01T19:49:05+02:00	(#xdfwwgq) Thanks to all of you :))) Been a really nice day today!
2023-08-02T13:39:17+02:00	(#xdfwwgq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, I got some cash that I will put aside for a rainy day. I initially wanted to buy a kickbike for the dog with that, but he should not be pulling too much until next year's fall, so I decided not to buy that now. I'll put the money aside for next year. Other then that I got a new harness for me that I use for the dog, we've had one but this one is more solid and fits better to my size. That is super useful - and will last for many many years. Also got a new hiking jacket, cotton jacket, green, outdoor type jacket, that is also something I really wanted, since I do not like those synthetic jackets (sweat too much in that). Also got some chocolate from my kids (Which I love). So I'm very pleased with the gifts :)
2023-08-02T14:54:47+02:00	Got contacted on instagram from someone who wanted to buy some of my images (NFT), I have been putting the images I liked the most into a collection (and add new ones when I take Images I think is good enough) into the collection. Just letting it sit there to see if I can make a sale one day.  Not sure yet if the person is serious or not - but If I could make a sale - then I'm all for it. It's much easier to put things up for sale as NFT then other ways.  I sell them as a 1 item thing. And put a price that I think is fair (Fixed price on all, but based on the amount of time I actually spend getting to all these locations).  One thing I have not liked about NFT is all the crap art stuff that there that takes 0 effort, but I do at least spend time picking out where we go. And each image has a memory attached to it, a trip with my family to that exact place..
2023-08-02T22:23:41+02:00	I hung up a older tv in our bedroom today, a dumb tv without any smart features, bought one of those new chromecast's, works very well, pleased with this setup. Gonna be nice to watch some TV in bed, or listen to podcasts etc.
2023-08-03T14:49:52+02:00	wish you all a great day!
2023-08-03T19:15:32+02:00	(#4kuvq6a) So, not unexpected - but the guy was a scammer. And he took his time trying to lure in. There where several red flags early on, but I went along with it because I wanted to know what the final way of scamming would be. So in the end he pretended that he had a ~5000USD transaction, and sent a screenshot from the same website as my NFT's are on (to try to look legitimate), but there was obviously no notification on the legit site about this. He then sent another QR code (which I extracted the url from in a isolated VM), and that was the phishing site, a kinda similar url to the main legit site - that forwards you there. So at least now his account is nuked and did not get anything from me at least.
2023-08-04T21:37:47+02:00	Today we went on another roadtrip! Was really nice, we also spent 2 hours in a crowded resturant (table outside), with our dog Nanook, went great! Kids could eat a whole pizza, and he just sat there next to the table taking in the view, dogs walked by, people walked by, crowded street etc, was awesome to see that all the training we have done gives very positive results :) Been a fantastic day. And was nice to spend it all with my family, I love having time off work.
2023-08-07T14:18:04+02:00	We had a wonderful day yesterday :) We went on this train for a ride (30 minutes each way).  ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/3VBvDeJepXEXgMEwn2hGwU.png)   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/mHCeaqgxhLpShJtx6wVpEN.png)   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/LdZdaR4pKC25jCY4Q2oyWC.png)
2023-08-07T14:22:52+02:00	(#meecqkq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yup! :) Was really nice. I was my kids age when I was on that train last time, so nice to bring back some memories, they had a really nice time.
2023-08-08T16:14:35+02:00	filmed a nice walk with Nanook today, you can watch it here : https://activitypub.stigatle.no/stigatle/p/1691503487.536879
2023-08-09T19:02:20+02:00	Yesterday and today Marlyn painted our kitchen, we have dark grey walls in the livingroom\kitchen, but our kitchen was high gloss white, but now she panted the kitchen the same color as the walls, turned out very nice! I really like it. And glad that she wanted to do that - I hate painting inside. Cheap way to make the kitchen feel new.
2023-08-10T18:33:24+02:00	(#knehnaa) @<prx https://si3t.ch/twtxt.txt> +1 for OpenBSD - great OS! I love using that OS.
2023-08-10T18:35:41+02:00	Bought myself a mountain bike today, first time (as a adult) that I have a really nice bike. it was on sale, and cost 1\3rd of the kickbike I kinda wanted. So after some thinking I decided that a bike is better for the dog (and me) then a kickbike. I assembled the bike and then went out so that he could have a long run, was awesome. I especially like it when he knows the commands I give (for left\right etc). So awesome to see him instantly know what I want him to do. He also ignored all people who walked or biked, and kept the pace throughout.
2023-08-11T12:10:16+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#bpweqxq) kickbike is one of these ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/kAiUXV3PACJJZppfe7mYsD.png)

2023-08-11T13:59:52+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (#bpweqxq) he had a run yesterday, and is still tired, so I finally found the off switch :)
2023-08-11T16:14:43+02:00	@<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> (#em3hj4q) thank you! I just came back from a 5km bike trail run, it was great. first time on a trail with bike, super narrow gravel, and trails, trees and forest all over, went really nice, its so cool that he knows the commmands I need, left, right, easy, go etc. makes me really proud, this is exactly what I wanted when we got our husky, and its so nice to see him grow in that way.
2023-08-16T14:02:22+02:00	@<phoronix https://feeds.twtxt.net/phoronix/twtxt.txt> (#u5frdlq) Nice! I have a machine with that CPU.
2023-08-19T11:12:28+02:00	Good morning to you all! Just had the morning walk with the dog in the rain, it's raining pretty bad today, all day. But that also means I have some time for my computer later today. I just have to figure out what to do first :) Probably code a bit, or reinstall one of my computers, I've been wanting to run #OpenBSD again, I tried it on one of my laptops, but wifi did not work for some reason, but I have some wifi dongles - so I'll try with that, or install on one of my other laptops. I have a #Thinkpad #x200 with #libreboot, I might give it a shot there - all though it takes some time to get it to work with libreboot, I did install it some years ago though, so I think that should work again now. Either way I'll figure out something to tinker with today!
2023-09-09T23:01:04+02:00	(#m3wos6a) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Dog walking, and my son started with organized football this week, so he's going on a tournament tomorrow (3 matches). Been working a lot as well (from home).. So busy weekend for sure. How about you?
2023-10-01T18:18:51+02:00	I'll shut down this instance soon, I want to say thanks to all of you, especially @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> . It's been fun here, but I do not spend much time here anymore - cutting down on the things I host and use \ spend time on etc.   I've been using activitypub more - since it's more or less replaced 'x' for me, and can be reached at:  @<stigatle https://activitypub.stigatle.no/stigatle>
2023-10-05T22:25:44+02:00	(#zxmtx4a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I will stick around, after thinking about it. Im sure support for both will come. Maybe Ill check if I can make some support in snac2 for yarn, that would be a fun project. I also want to work some more on the yarn desktop client, I miss working on it, polish it and make it more feature complete, and then also make one for snac2/activitypub (or make it into a general client that supports both at the same time).
2023-10-05T22:41:17+02:00	I started working on a new scene (3D), I've wanted to make a short movie for a while, and I work on some of my ideas to get something started. Here is one of the scenes I made last weekend..  ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/ht35k9CVUZypDTaLGDtcSk.png)

2023-10-07T13:27:18+02:00	Another day, another terror war breaks out. Sickening videos and images getting out of there. So glad I do not live in a shithole wartorn place to be honest, but feel bad for those who live that way. Innocent people getting murdered every day for nothing.
2023-10-07T13:37:54+02:00	(#33eeksq) Israel , hamas etc. been crazy there since last night.
2023-10-07T14:11:19+02:00	(#33eeksq) Its nuts. Im a bit lost for words to be honest. Such a shock-attack, and taking civilians as hostages, shooting them, killing them, torture, kidnap kids and so on. Oooffff. Wonder what the response and aftermath will be..
2023-10-07T14:49:14+02:00	(#33eeksq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, so hard to just get along. It's been conflict there for a long time, but still... What would it take for it to end?
2023-10-07T14:54:10+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  - I do not want to nag about it - but did you find some way to post image through curl? (Or could you share the almost-working solution that you tried?), if you have not had time - then that's fine too. I want to start looking into it again :)
2023-10-07T17:35:54+02:00	(#agjpbta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Sure, I'll do that! Thank you so much, I'll start working on getting it into the client tonight.
2023-10-07T17:59:07+02:00	(#wgfzyba) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Nice! I just came home from a long walk myself. Walked through the forest, and then by the roads. Now the dog is sleeping. I like to wear him out a bit in the weekends so that we get some proper 'time off' in the evening etc :)
2023-10-08T15:02:58+02:00	(#wgfzyba) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> it worked yesterday, but today hes all over the place, not calming down much. We’re going to burgerking later today, so he’ll get some crate time in the car then (he always relaxes when he’s in the car).
2023-10-08T19:02:43+02:00	(#agjpbta) Started on it tonight, got the file pick dialog to work, so now I just need to get the json stuff to work.
2023-10-08T22:23:07+02:00	![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/2Ft7Azn55neXD2Z4wwiCWE.png) if this image shows up - we then have support for image upload in Yarn desktop client. :)
2023-10-08T22:23:33+02:00	(#u6chapa) it sure worked! Woho! I will clean it up and get it pushed as soon as possible. Done for tonight.
2023-10-09T14:39:25+02:00	(#agjpbta) No polling yet, but that part is important as you say, I will need to implement that. Now I have the pieces I need at least :)
2023-10-09T16:07:55+02:00	(#agjpbta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I do that now, and all that works, it's just that I do not (currently) check it multiple times, in the test I did it completed as soon as the image was uploaded. But yeah I have to do some more with that for bigger files for sure. I'll look into that next.
2023-10-09T16:52:33+02:00	(#agjpbta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> that would make me proud. Ill add more description and screenshots to the readme so that people can see more easily what it looks like etc. I also want to make ready packages for it, and see if I can crosscompile for windows as well.
2023-10-09T22:31:30+02:00	I've been on OpenSuse tumbleweed for some months, but I've been having issues with kdevelop and vscode, not showing includes and stuff like that correctly (and not compiling stuff, had to work in editor, then compile through commandline), making it a pain to develop on. Never figured out what the issue was, so I switched back to debian tonight, got everything working, so now I can code efficiently again. Feels good.
2023-10-09T22:32:38+02:00	(#57uhgka) And I do distrohop a lot, but now I'm sticking with debian (I promise :p ), always end up back on it..

2023-10-10T18:55:01+02:00	(#agjpbta) I had some time to code this afternoon, so I have made some polling now, so if a task is not completed it waits 2 secs and tries again, if the server reports a error in the task it stops polling, when the task is successfull it will add the resulting image tag to the status input field. Quite pleased with this now. After this I'll work on 'view conversation', meanning you can open a conversation and see all posts in it, that'll make it even easier to follow conversations and to reply etc.
2023-10-11T17:32:38+02:00	(#h4cmpga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank you for doing that! :)
2023-10-12T19:32:39+02:00	So, a husky will pull. Tried all kinds of training for it, but his pulling does not go away, often it's OK when we walk with a regular collar, but he can also pull crazy hard with that - he just does not care if he chokes. when I walk with harness - he can pull as much as he wants\needs (since we both have one). But the problem is that he still pulls as hard on leash, tried one of those 'slip' leashes for a good while, but he could not care less. So today I bought something else (see attached image (not my dog in the image)). And this thing is magical, honestly. He does not like to have it on much yet, but I can now hold the leash with one finger. And the thing is that when you use this - they most likely will learn from that and walk nice on regular leash as well.  So yeah, just wanted to mention it, since it works better then anything else I've tried.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/tEG9v2ydq69LUCifaPKeCF.png)
2023-10-13T08:56:11+02:00	Weekend is getting close!  We have a packed weekend for sure, but it'll be a nice one :) Hope you all get to have a nice day! What are you all doing this weekend? Anything cool?

2023-10-17T18:30:08+02:00	A 7 year old boy has been missing in a forest since Sunday after he got away from his family that he was on a hunt with, its the biggest search party In a long while that has been looking for him, hundreds and hundreds of people, some has been helping out with drones (and driven 800km to get there), and search dogs from all over Norway joined. And sadly today they found a dead person there. It’s really sad. Been thinking about him every day, and especially when I go to bed, and then think that this 7 year old has been missing outside, at night alone etc. weather has not been nice either. Ooooffff…

Always nice to do a walk, and fun to test stuff like GPS and such :) I've been walking a bit as well today, but also had some nice time at home, I work a bit this weekend, so I've spent some time on that. But also we went to the mall and such. Now we're baking pizza. And will watch a movie or something when the kids has gone to sleep tonight. :)
2023-10-28T18:51:00+02:00	(#ttg3rma) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> Hope you get well soon! :)

2023-10-31T20:25:18+01:00	(#ttg3rma) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Oh, I had a experience this weekend as well, a dog was barking in the forest, sounded like something was wrong (it's a fairly public area), I then continued my walk, and Nanook got more and more nervous, I then continued the walk, and Nanook froze. I could still hear the dog barking quite close. And then someone shot a rifle. I'm glad I did not walk up to where that dog was, I kinda wanted too, because I first thought maybe something was wrong. But it honestly weirded me out that they did this in such a place as they did, almost called the cops to be honest to check with them, but I did not at the time..

2023-11-01T06:31:59+01:00	(#ttg3rma) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> they did not shoot the dog, some other animal.
2023-11-01T19:18:16+01:00	(#ttg3rma) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I checked the local police twitter, and they always post if it's important stuff. And due to it's location  I'm sure other heard it as well when it happened. I'm thinking maybe it was a deer hit by a car or something that needed to be neutralized.
2023-11-02T20:44:30+01:00	All day today I've been feeling like I could fall a sleep any minute.. Gonna be nice to get the kids to bed, then put on netflix and fall a sleep on the couch tonight.
2023-11-03T16:19:47+01:00	Been working for two weeks straight, so now Im going to relax and enjoy the weekend. What are you all up to this weekend?
2023-11-03T22:40:17+01:00	Got latest OpenBSD installed on one of my laptops, now Ill try and get the desktop client to work there. This will be fun!
2023-11-04T00:10:08+01:00	(#igx4zpq) First issue I ran into is rapidjson, there is no package for it, but it compiled from source without google tests. But I did not check what version I had on my debian machine, so I need to check that and compile the same version on openbsd. Ill work on that tomorrow.
2023-11-04T09:23:19+01:00	(#igx4zpq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> yeah, it worked fine when It installed from mirror :) I had same issue in virtualbox. I suspect its the same problem. But now I have it installed the way I like it, encrypted, and lxqt desktop on my laptop.
2023-11-05T11:51:02+01:00	I have not been feeling good the past two days, caught a cold. So yesterday I was very lazy, luckily the kids where busy with their things, and Marlyn took Nanook to the dogpark to let him blow off some steam. Today I feel much better, so I headed out early for a 5km walk in the forest with the dog before everyone got up this morning. When I came home my daughter went to her friends house, so she will probably be gone for the rest of the day, and my son is playing games with his friends. Its still raining a lot here, but I managed to do to the walk in between the rain. Now Im working some more on the laptop I installed OpenBSD on this weekend. Getting more stuff set up on it.
2023-11-08T16:10:05+01:00	My daughter started with indoor sand volleyball yesterday, she is now going to go there 2x a week, so happy that she found something she likes, her best friend started too - so they will go together there :)

2023-11-10T16:47:46+01:00	Finally weekend. Came home from work, walked the dog for an hour. Now it's time to relax for the rest of the day :) Will probably sit on the computer a bit tonight. Not sure what I'll do there yet, but I'll figure something out for sure.
2023-11-11T11:33:41+01:00	Today I started my day getting up early, dog woke me up at 08:30, I then went for a 2 hour walk in the forest next to our city center. I hiked through there, down through the city and then around and back to the car. Was nice to see Nanook's progress on walking through the main street, he's can get overwhelmed there at times, and start to jump and nip etc, can be stressful when there is a lot of people around, because he's a big dog. But I have trained a lot on that, because he does the same thing at a parking lot I usually walk through on our regular walks, so each time I've taken that walk I walk through there, and when he starts acting up I just ask him to sit, and when he sits he gets a treat, and we then resume the walk, if he walks fine he gets a new treat, if he acts up I tell him to sit again. I've done this over and over.. And now at our walk through the main street - I could do the same thing, so much less stressful :) And makes it a joy to walk there.

2023-11-18T08:53:38+01:00	Today it's cold, a bit of snow in the air. I'll head out for a long walk in a bit, I'll go a new place, a 9km trail. I'll try to remember to take some pictures.  Wish you all a great Saturday!

2023-11-25T21:20:55+01:00	Dragged Marlyn and our kids out tonight to see the northern lights. Never seen it with my own eyes until tonight.   ![](https://yarn.stigatle.no/media/TYxZNJ22ZoHZpzVjCGaUHY.png)

2023-12-19T17:14:09+01:00	(#cnsi5ja) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> hehe, we won :) but they did good!
2023-12-20T09:00:37+01:00	Last day at the office for the rest of the year! Looking forward to have some proper time off to spend with my family :)
2023-12-21T20:37:10+01:00	We went to the cinema tonight, was really nice to be there and see a movie with the kids :) We saw a classic Norwegian Christmas movie - a new movie in the 'Jul i skomakergata' series.
2023-12-22T12:44:52+01:00	(#vnpitjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Yeah, it costs a lot here too (500 NOK for tickets for 2 adults and 2 kids), and about 200 NOK for some candy there.. (2 sodas, and 2 other items).. But we do not do it often, so I do not think too much of it.  But yeah, it costs a lot.
2023-12-22T13:34:23+01:00	(#vnpitjq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ah, they have that here too, couches and such, you pay extra for that. But they have 5 halls, and we went to the smallest one. Luckily not sitting next to anyone sick :) haha, but yeah, it crossed my mind.. Have not caught anything recently, and a bit risky to go to packed places right before Christmas, but it went fine this time :)
2023-12-24T14:00:56+01:00	(#7thohva) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thank you! And same to you and your family :) christmas tree is ready, food in the oven, gonna be nice tonight :)

2023-12-30T11:41:27+01:00	I like coding on stuff, but I rarely spend time in unreal engine, or godot, but I still want to code on some game stuff once in a while. I think I've found what I've been looking for to test out - #raylib https://www.raylib.com/ , I want to recreate one of my older (outdated) projects that I did a while back in godot, but make the same with raylib. Also it would be cool to use the USD ( https://openusd.org/release/index.html ) library that me and a friend is coding - to then implement it and load USD scenes in raylib, that would be very nice, that way I get to work on both the USD library, and code some game stuff at the same time, always nice to combine things.
2023-12-30T11:59:10+01:00	Wow, we can get up to a meter of snow in a very short time here, proper snowstorm! Exciting! Also next week the temp drops, cold from siberia comes here, so it'll probably stick around for a while. :)
2023-12-31T10:45:58+01:00	(#z67c5ca) That snow sadly turned into rain instead :(
2023-12-31T21:59:27+01:00	(#z67c5ca) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> had 2 long walks with Nanook in the rain today, foreworks has started, but he does not care at all ( which is really nice). Getting colder tonight, so itll snow a bit the next days.
2024-01-01T01:53:59+01:00	(#z67c5ca) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> yeah, with proper clothing its pretty nice. After I came home it turned into snow, and it snows really hard, so tomorrow I have the fun task of clearing as much as I can :) Its about 2 at night now, just walked the dog after fireworks has calmed down. He was super excited to see all the snow.. but now its time for some sleep :)
2024-01-01T01:54:46+01:00	Happy new year to all of you, will be exciting to see what this year will bring!
2024-01-01T13:26:13+01:00	Oh wow, we got almost a meter of snow over night, took over 2 hours to get the car space cleared. Now I have to take the snow off the veranda, and clear some in the garden (Nanook is acting up today, he loves the snow, so will clear some out around the fence, so that he can be out all day if he wants).. I do not want to do a long walk in this weather..)
2024-01-01T19:16:32+01:00	(#u725dzq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> too dark now, but Ill see what I can do tomorrow :)

2024-01-02T19:40:58+01:00	(#xzxbvtq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> wind is pretty bad about -15c in wind chill, I should have snowgoggles, but the cap helps (can just tilt head down in the worst wind). Been a crazy day, walked the dog 5km, came home, took over a meter of snow off veranda, helped 2 cars that was stuck on our street, helped neighbour showeling the snow to get his car in, then dug out our car (just in case we need it), and then had to walk to the store (2km) and back because you cant get car out from our street tonight. So for the rest of the evening Im not doing nothing. Haha They closed svhools tomorrow as well because of the chaos.
2024-01-03T09:04:11+01:00	One car was parked half way into garage yesterday, and owner went away, and now snow cannot be cleared because they cannot get past the car (dead end street). So the owner fucked up for everyone here. No one can get anywhere. Pisses me off.
2024-01-03T11:24:54+01:00	(#rg3g6nq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> we found out she was actually home, so I helped her get the car out of the way. So all is good now :)

2024-01-04T17:33:45+01:00	Helped pur neighbour today, climbed over to them from second floor, and dug down to the veranda door from roof height, so now they can look out their windows again :) over the weekend I have to get rid of all the snow on our terrace, almost 2 meters there now. But it has stopped snowing now, so its nice to get a break after this.
2024-01-04T20:01:39+01:00	(#z6tbvxq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> not normal, last time there was this much was 10 years ago. Highway got shut down back then, with people stuck, remember a colleague of mine who got stuck on his way home after work and was still stuck the next morning on highway.   The amount of snow we got this time was a bit shocking, schools has been closed for 3 days (but open tomorrow), all public transport got shut down yesterday (but running again now).
2024-01-05T21:01:09+01:00	Moved more snow today than  ever before. Terrace is now ready for use. -10c out, tomorrow we’ll sit there with the portable fire pit, make some food on it :) this week has been crazy, but now it’s weekend and time to relax a bit.
2024-01-06T13:26:12+01:00	(#p6gk6qa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Very cool! what language is used for the coding?
2024-01-09T11:06:40+01:00	When it comes to AI stuff - I like to run it myself, not use a service. I found this today - https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile I'll give that a good try when I need it, instead of chatgpt  and such services.

2024-01-09T16:23:40+01:00	(#oksalga) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> That works pretty well, this is what I needed. :) I like it so far, feels good to run it locally instead of on some online service.. pulled a couple of models (including the one for code). I'll check that one out next time I'm looking for a solution for something I'm stuck on.
2024-01-12T21:15:15+01:00	Bought some more fencing for the garden, need to make it a bit higher some places, so that our husky can spend more time there, a couple of places has been a bit flimsy, time to fix it :) If he really wanted - he could easily get over, but he just likes to stay in the garden, and does never mess with the fence (wire mesh fence, wooden poles in the ground). Also have a long chain as well (that's as long as the garden) but he does not want to have that one one (and it's under 1.5m of snow now). If he ever jumps over or digs himself out I'll get one of long wires that goes overhead that I can attach one of those pulleys \ leash too, that'll be better then a long chain.
2024-01-12T23:09:00+01:00	(#sqcj56q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> ,  we’re just adding more fence on top, the top of fence is over the snow, and the poles are higher, so I can work with it regardless of snow :) i just ziptie the extra fence, so easy to work with
2024-01-16T17:46:13+01:00	(#sqcj56q) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> got it done today before it got dark (and more snow on the way). Felt good to have it fixed. Now I can finally relax when he’s out there by himself.
2024-01-17T15:48:57+01:00	wow, we got about 30\40cm of snow last night, and when I woke up we could not even look out the window because of the snow storm, thought the kids would not get to school, but right before they left for the bus it cleared up. Got rid of the snow outside after work today, so now it's clear skies and nice out :)
2024-01-20T10:20:31+01:00	Getting warmer tomorrow and the next week or so, hope most of the snow melts so that I can head out and walk in the forest again - I miss that.

He has usually been in the garden, but that has been dug into a mudhole by the dog, so when it's rainy\wet etc he can now stay on the terrace. Other then that I'll probably do some coding on my multiplayer game today, since our kids are busy with friends etc.
