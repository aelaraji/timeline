2024-05-01T14:14:17-06:00	(#tolmmcq) you got me 😉 I don't use my account on twtxt.net although I like the content that is found there.  Yeah, Yarn as a piece of software is really nice, I've said that a few times before.  Although technology is only a piece of the puzzle. As a community/ecosystem is perhaps too niche. I agree that 'social platforms' don't need to be meaningful, perhaps they don't even need to be useful. We are sharing time and words here, so that's good by itself.
2024-04-30T14:03:41-06:00	(#gxolr6a) Well, I don't use Yarn/Twtxt.net anymore, although I read the homepage a few times a week to catchup on anything interesting.   Nowadays I barely twt from my PHP instance. I got to say that is more "convenient" reading from twtxt.net that on my instance.   My current feeling is that is too niche to find something interesting, being about personal growth, professional or even entertaining. There is not enough people and/or interesting topics to be engaged on. The network effect of people making content is missing IMO. Although I have a similar feeling of any other microblogging, it's too superficial to have a meaningful conversation.  Sadly in this ecosystem I've found no one twting on Spanish, and having conversations in English is not so easy to me.   And about local communities, I tried to invite friends and colleagues, but no one created their instance or joined to Yarn. Even the local Mastodon instance has 3 members (myself included), so I think creating a hipster microblogging is not as easy as looked at the start.   It's again a decision between the involved time and the 'reward' at the end. If we are not getting good emotions or something bigger that ourselves, feels like 'not worthy' to belong.
2024-04-21T13:43:49-06:00	A quiet Sunday, with family, my dog 🐶, house cleaning, preparing for a travel tomorrow...   That's all the twt
2024-04-21T13:41:58-06:00	(#nlzhexa) Indeed, BitWarden works nice as a credentials manager, and I'm quite happy with the implementation of Passkeys.  Sadly my old Android 9 is not compatible with the mobile app, although I use the web for that case. That said, that's what I've been using for years and I can't find a reason to try another (as usually happens with these tools)   I'd suggest of self-host or trying a public instance of Vaultwarden like https://passwd.hostux.net (donation supported)
2024-04-19T09:48:41-06:00	Why do clickers are named like that?  The buttons on Zenith’s original ‘clicker’ TV remote were a mechanical marvel  https://www.theverge.com/23810061/zenith-space-command-remote-control-button-of-the-month
2024-04-19T09:46:34-06:00	“A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both.” ― L.P. Jacks
2024-04-05T18:24:54-06:00	I added an Atom feed to '7 links of the day'. Find some curated links (a few in spanish and french) every morning. https://eapl.me/links/feed.php
2024-04-01T18:03:15-06:00	(#gwa5pja) and about players, well: VLC (Win/Mac/UX), Musikcube (Win), Music Player (Android), Revanced (Android) Formerly Evil Player, Small player
2024-04-01T17:58:42-06:00	(#jfzitsa) Nothing fancy, although it has changed along the years.  I payed for Spotify Premium for many years, but since 2020 I think it lost its value for me, so I switched to YT, or a local company is offering Deezer free for a year.  I've been playing with the idea of storing most of my music in SD cards or internal memory from an old android.  Currently in my car I listen to music in a SD card with 'everything' I've been getting in the last 10+ years. I'm lazy to switch on the Bluetooth on my phone.  At home, I have a few different speakers, with line input and bluetooth. My wife has an Alexa near the dining room, so we often listen to music or the radio there.  Also, very often I play Youtube playlists on the TV (I'm looking for some way to listen to Youtube on a speaker, but haven't found any. Or with the phone with Revanced (which stopped working last week)  Since I have diverse players I try to stick to MP3 VBR, although I try to download or convert tracks to 'more recent' formats. Weirdly my car allows WMA, and more weirdly I have some tracks which came to that SD card mysteriously. I haven't found FLAC interesting as when I was in college, I can't notice a difference between lossy and loseless formats. Perhaps my environment is too noisy or I'm getting older 😅  That said, I'd really want to isolate my home-office, I have too much reverb when recording, and also external noise, which sometimes affect when listening to music.

2024-03-20T10:07:56-06:00	Interesting analysis on how we face stress based on our personality and preferences… Checked a few of those 5 types.  https://stack.betwixt.life/p/the-five-faces-of-stress
2024-03-17T19:54:23-06:00	This is interesting allowing to access a Web with SSH, although a bit complicated for the 'regular' user https://pico.sh/tunnels  I'd expect some one-time password, or some challenge to copy and paste. Anyway, it always makes mi think of alternatives to passwords.
2024-03-16T13:48:45-06:00	(#dzobbnq) interesting, how does it work?
2024-03-11T18:54:58-06:00	(#ptplydq) Ha! I had one of these in college (Win XP), and my father had a slightly newer model (Win Vista).  It was great to play FIFA 08, and the keyboard was amazing, although I agree it was really heavy and thick, but was affordable and powerful for that age.  Now I had a Dell Inspiron 2014 with Xubuntu, and works pretty well. I changed from HDD to SSD and it's now a pretty decent laptop to type notes and hacking a bit.
2024-02-29T22:22:24-06:00	(#3syipzq) well, at work we use JSONC which basically is JSON + // and /* */ Its syntax is supported by vs code, and we wrote a few scripts to remove the comments so it's practically compatible with anything It's day and night not only for configuration but for testing and development.
2024-02-28T13:02:03-06:00	(#wnbmb2q)  Organization eligibility - Must run an active open source or free software project. - Must have produced and released software under an OSI approved license. - Must not be based in a country currently embargoed by the United States.  Sadly the application period is over, but we could register the project for next year. https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4JNz6zWzLs
2024-02-28T12:58:03-06:00	(#zwpd7hq) For Python, env files with dotenv. For JS, usually JSONP or a config.js For PHP a config.php with an array usually works For C#, I try to avoid the ugly native XML, but it's what most of the team use...  For most I have a .env.sample in the repo, and we ignore .env or config* to avoid storing credentials.
2024-02-27T11:29:20-06:00	I came across Google Summer of Code  This one looks interesting, I'll apply soon, and perhaps is interesting for you as well https://kiwix.org/en/google-summer-of-code/  Would 'twtxt' be a good project for the next one? 🤔
2024-02-16T07:53:26-06:00	(#k6ie4ua) for video-game courses... All the university uses it 😬
2024-02-15T18:29:18-06:00	(#4xdp7oa) daaaamn...  I haven't used Matrix in ages, just Telegram, WA, Discord and Teams... I think I got used to those. Perhaps that's because none of my acquaintances is in Matrix or XMPP, what am I missing?
2024-02-15T18:25:20-06:00	I had forgotten a bit this twtxt... How are you doing these days ?
2024-02-06T14:09:41-06:00	"We need our sensitivity to be hurt in order to grow. If we protect our feelings, we become cyclical, remain impoverished, frustrated, stagnant. You need a love, a coach, a boss, an influencer, a stranger who emotionally wounds your worldview so you can then redirect that anger/pain it causes you towards an analysis that helps you eliminate/optimize much of what you're doing." —A.

2024-02-06T08:59:39-06:00	After getting used to it, I'm loving this date format: 2024-02-06  I liked '6feb2024', although isn't as international as the former. And... '06/02/24' is awful, don't use it!
2024-02-01T19:48:28-06:00	(#tjevvyq) Well, I'll describe basic microblogging actions as: Reply - Extend a conversation, create a new twt in reply to another Boost, Retweet, Repost - Silently show a twt to your followers (maybe to share some interesting URL to follow based on that twt) Quote - Start a new conversation based on a previous twt (debatable, for instance Masto doesn't have this one, has to be done manually)  To go back a few steps I was checking this doc: https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/twtsubjectextension.html  Reply is already covered there. Allows to tag someone with @<nick1 url1> which I think is good enough to start following that URL to see the whole conv. For quoting, I like your idea of using '>' It could be something like ``` (#hash) @<nick url> > "Quoted text"\nThen a comment ```  Finally for boosting, there's no syntax to do that.  Since I was using `[lang=en]` to define a twt in a language different than the default one, I was thinking on something similar.  Perhaps ``` (#hash) @<nick url> [boost] ```  Meaning, "hey! see that twt with hash # from that URL"
2024-01-31T09:45:32-06:00	I'm thinking of a kind of 'boost' or 'retweet/repost' for twtxt, so it can help with discoverability of interesting people to follow.  Something like [BOOST][URL] [QUOTE][URL]"Snippet"

Could @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> share some insights on that?
2024-01-05T09:58:02-06:00	(#djhawzq) > What is the difference between twtxt-php and timeline from sorenpeter? twtxt-php is a minimalistic client based on another PHP project, you can see it on https://eapl.mx/twtxt timeline is a better-looking Web app, with support for markdown, images gallery... you can see it here http://darch.dk/timeline/  twtxt-php is not actively developed, its core was merged into timeline  > Does it have a way to follow feeds from the web ui? Yes, but you have to be logged in. Currently can only add URLs, not edit or unfollow.  > I was looking at it and what prevents someone from downloading the .config file and getting the password?  An .htaccess file  > Also how would I generate a totp password to use? That part is missing on the Web side, there is a commented PHP code to do that https://github.com/eapl-gemugami/twtxt-php/blob/master/libs/TOTP.php#L121  Although you can find a better TOTP onboarding on https://fit.eapl.me
2024-01-03T16:14:42-06:00	(#5xky32a) yarn is really cool, go for it!   Also, if you are looking for some lightweight and unfinished client, I could recommend the PHP script I'm using to reply here.  Started as a raw PHP script to twt and reply from my phone, running from a shared hosting, then evolved into twtxt-php on Github and parts of it were merged to https://github.com/sorenpeter/timeline  And it's live here: http://darch.dk/timeline/  The idea behind it is having 1 instance, and 1 .txt for each account, not using any database but only the .txt. Kind of experimental although works good enough 🙂
2024-01-03T13:49:56-06:00	(#zxib3ra) main problem with encrypted stuff is a good ratio between usability and security, when usability is "easier than what we already know", being IRC, Whats, Discord among others.

2023-11-18T14:05:38-06:00	I've been reading "Shareware Heroes: The renegades who redefined gaming at the dawn of the internet" learning of games developed before I was born, or when was too small. I'm finding old gems to play and understanding that we have the same problems developing games 30+ years after, although with some obvious differences.  Currently playing: https://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Kentris.html  Which reminds me of another Tetris I don't know how it came to my PC in the 90s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaK7v8UNjo0
2023-11-18T13:59:54-06:00	I've been thinking of how to notify someone else that you've replied to their twts.  Is there something already developed, for example on yarn.social?  Let's say I want to notify https://sour.is/tiktok/America/Denver.txt that I've replied to some twt. They don't follow me back, so they won't see my reply.  I would send my URL to, could be, https://sour.is/tiktok/replies?url=MY_URL and they'll check that I have a reply to some of their twts, and could decide to follow me back (after seeing my twtxt profile to avoid spam)  Another option could be having a metadata like follow-request=https://sour.is/tiktok/America/Denver.txt TIMESTAMP_IN_SECONDS that the other client has to look for, to ensure that the request comes from that URL (again, to avoid spam) This could be deleted after the other .txt has your URL in the follow list, or auto-expire after X days to clean-up old requests.  What do you think?

I bought a SSL certificate for my shared hosting, sadly it doesn't support Let's Encrypt.  But if an extension is doing that, I think there is not much to do from our side.

2023-11-10T16:46:16-06:00	(#iz4mzbq) another crazy experiment would be that the sunset starts at 7am, but the time is slowed down or made running faster so it's always 7pm at the sunset.  In July here we have 14 hours of daylight, and only 10:21 in December. So the idea would be to adjust working days or whatever, proportional to the amount of natural light we have in that month. Just thinking...
2023-11-10T13:44:12-06:00	(#eklzdvq) wow, indeed your 24 hours clocks is interesting.  I had a phase of time nerd and made a few clocks, and certainly  a physical one with sun rise and sun set marks will be cool to make!
2023-11-10T11:26:20-06:00	(#r2rt65a) it needs more explanation than only showing the time 😅  Yes, the idea is that it changes a few seconds every day to "start" at 7am with the sun ☀ The day lasts about 24 hours as usual

My country is/was living in an internal war and now everything feels 'calm'.   As a user of technology, a hobbyist, and designer of new tech, it's interesting to spend some time thinking on it.

(With offline backups, TOTPs of 6 to 10 digits, and some customizations)  I tried FreeOTP very briefly. On Android, it doesn't work as I'd expect. It doesn't read the QR code from my app (having inverted colors) and gives a warning that my parameters are insecure (which could be with SHA-1, but it's the first time I see that warning 👀). And on iOS 10 (latest available on my old iPhone), I assume it gets an old version without support for 10 digits, what my Web apps use.  So I couldn't really recommend it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2023-09-08T18:36:06-06:00	(#y7vnbia) yep, it's not a passwordless solution as a TOTP is a dynamic password, but the idea is to reduce keyloggers and phishing impact a bit by not using the same passwords forever. If you already have 2FA, you reduce a step. It's experimental, and not recommended for current security standards, although it could work for geeks.  More like an indie proposal between passwords and Webauthn without Auth services in the middle (like AWS, Azure, Auth0 and so on)  For example, a proposal from Microsoft I found recently: ![https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions/passwordless-authentication] (https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/image_RE529Ih?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=3200&hei=1500&qlt=100&fmt=png-alpha&fit=constrain)

2023-09-08T12:04:49-06:00	(#iwv6bea) well, TOTP are single-use passwords with many settings. Later they were used as a 2nd factor. For this case only 6 digits every 30 seconds, so they are easy to brute-force and not recommended as a single factor. (I found in SO some maths behind this attack if anyone is interested)   My idea is using TOTPs of about 16 digits as dynamic passwords, being same length than credit cards. Sadly most apps only allow up to 8 digits.
2023-09-08T11:57:36-06:00	(#bkyodfa) have you seen this by same author? https://humanshader.com  It's amazing to me how with 'simple' operations you can reach to that image. Although it's a simple one, it always thrills me, like when I was a kid in the 90s.
2023-09-07T20:33:26-06:00	Today I was fighting against a TOTP library in PHP, since it works for 6 and 8 digits, but for 10 it was giving inconsistent values, due to a conversion to a 32 bits int.  It felt amazing when, after a few hours, I found what was causing the error...  And found that many libraries have the same problem. Now I get why TOTP is limited to 8 chars. It's a 2FA but not a Password. Perhaps another algorithm will be needed to support 16 digits.

2023-08-21T20:16:17-06:00	What a rough day 😣  I had forgotten how to mix a full job with everything else. I my 20s I studied, worked from Mon to Sun and spent time with my (now) wife.  I think it's just a matter of getting used to it again. (In a healthy manner, of course)
2023-08-21T11:15:32-06:00	(#gl7ltqq) sorry, wrong name... It's Distraction Free Tube (DF Tube)
2023-08-21T10:56:37-06:00	(#upi5c7q) I assume you've checked Youtube Kids and it is not what you are looking for...  I use ReVanced on Android, to hide ads, comments, the Home tab, and a few recommendations.   On Chromium-based browsers and Firefox, I use the extension Clickbait Remover.  Both plugins make a whole different experience. It's like a 'dumb' player.  I don't know if that's kids friendly or if have some parental controls, but I think if kids don't find how to change parameters, it could help.
2023-08-20T22:25:18-06:00	(#jgvzita) Ah! Pachelbel's Canon in D 😀 Initiator of One-Hit Wonders, default piece for weddings, and first notes for many piano players...  In a random anecdote, when I was in High School, as a teenager learning music somehow listened to it for the first time, and got obsessed looking for different versions on P2P software of that time (Ares, Napster? I don't remember).  Then I found a shady MP3 with a cool rock version. Drums, bass, and 2 guitars tapping together. I really liked that version, and tried for months to play it but was too difficult for my current skills. Never found it again on YouTube or any platform. And didn't have any Artist's name or track info, so I never knew who made it. I'd need to dust off my CDs to find that MP3, I want to listen to it again, and perhaps look for the missing author again.  And recently learned that the original version was different from what we listen to now... Ah... Remixes everywhere https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8Jjs36bHd4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10Y6SBoImkk
2023-08-20T21:54:56-06:00	(#jcd4mrq) I think I need to stop writing anything positive when people is ranting 👀  Sorry for the cultural misunderstanding 😅
2023-08-20T21:39:57-06:00	(#5hk6olq) weeeell... I used to run our studio on Discord at least 8 hours a day, and also giving my classes, about 10 hours a week on Discord. So yes, you can work there. And for me, it's the same problem for leisure, open source projects, communities, etc.  And I think we have different ethics, and perhaps different responsabilities. Answering instantly as a boss, as a Dev, as a professor or as a friend, is not one of mine. Unless it's truly an emergency where lives are in danger. But as usual I respect my friends deciding to do otherwise.
2023-08-20T11:11:38-06:00	(#na4w65q) yep, Mega Hit Poker on mobile. It's my favourite free-to-play poker due to the tournament modes, leagues... ♥️♠️
2023-08-20T08:35:11-06:00	(#5x4xrdq) I can't disagree although it's almost the same with any corporate IM I have to use for work and school, like Slack and Teams.  First thing I do is taking half of an hour to disable notifications on Desktop, phones, mails, and even doing that they are trying to steal your focus interrupting you due to lack of settings for that.   I think the default fight for our attention creates an expectation of immediate response to everything and we should counter-fight to create the opposite effect. Digital minimalism helps here IMO. Checking messages only once a day, replying hours later unless it's a true life and death emergency, and so on.

2023-08-18T17:02:10-06:00	Aaaand officially the weekend has started 😀
2023-08-18T16:51:27-06:00	(#2a3pssq) Thanks for sharing that diagram, it's very insightful, makes me think a lot :)  Long post ahead to clarify my thoughts... There are many moving parts but we could simplify them as: > Twtxt starts with a txt file stored in a Web server. Inside that file, there are URLs to other Web servers with many twt files.  > By Web, I oversimplify it as HTTP(S), DNS, UTF-8, and all the technology required to transfer those text files. > Protocol would be "a defined set of rules and regulations that determine how data is transmitted". > Format is the "shape" of the text file.  Although most of the twtxt files are not interconnected with each other, a few are, creating a micro-network effect. Seeing replies to a friend of yours, and wanting to follow that new URL. Somehow we got the URLs and are valid (not depending on a central directory).  I think from the strict technical definition, a distributed system would require to have copies of the text files from other servers, made available to 3rd parties. At least with `twtxt-php` I'm not thinking of that model. There is only 1 available source for each following URL. There is no redundancy but some local cache.  About distribution, the definition of 'distributing control and decision-making, reducing reliance on a central authority' is hard for me to connect with twtxt. Let me explain a bit: On a twtxt text file and most CLI clients, the rule is "Follow these URLs with a compatible format and show me their content. If it's not compatible or it's not accessible show an error", and I think that's it. You cannot restrict who can see your file. So there is no need for a central authority in a pure sense. There is no moderation, privacy policies, muting a whole server, etc. Some kind of censorship could arrive by IP or domains like what happens on the Web so I'm ignoring it for the moment.  I find a similarity with an Atom feed but with the ability to follow each other using software to manage the replies, discovery, and such.  On Yarn or Masto we have Pods and Instances. Each server is a 'mini central authority' for its members if I'm seeing it correctly. The server defines a set of rules for all its users, although some personal parameters could be tweaked. We have a Local timeline, helping with discoverability. The content is tied to the software. If the server is down, usually all these users are affected. Could we say this model is semi-centralized or semi-decentralized? How do we define how decentralized is something?  Leaving philosophical questions aside, with `twtxt-php` I don't know how to categorize it. It's not distributed for sure. I could say it's decentralized: One micro-server for each URL file.  The URLs are compatible or not, so there is no need for authority, other than a protocol to intercommunicate. 🤔  I should make a new diagram with all these ideas over the weekend 😄
2023-08-18T12:39:03-06:00	(#pfdx4ga) Thanks! Open standards and common protocols are key...  HTTP(S), UTF-8, RFC 3339, just to name a few that come to mind
2023-08-18T09:40:15-06:00	I'm creating the default twtxt.txt file for `twtxt-php`, and I made a pause to think of the introductory text 🤨  > Twtxt is an (open/distributed/decentralized) microblogging platform for hackers and friends that use (raw text files/easy to read by humans), with common protocols, and (free/open) software  Although I know it's a hard discussion, I'd like to hear your thoughts on what twtxt is and what twtxt-php should be. Main points: - Distributed or decentralized? - Free or open source? - Human readable formats or raw text?  I think explaining thatshowingt-time user, would require a link to a whole explanation, but I think having the foundations for the remaining of the development would be helpful for the project.
2023-08-18T08:57:02-06:00	(#hshhn3q) hehe, interesting. In Spanish 'oftalmólogo' is the person, and 'oftalmología' the discipline.  I couldn't imagine 'Augenarzt' and 'Augenheilkunde' were so related, makes me wonder how the language makes us think.  I just translated 'oftalmólogo' and got the longer word 😆
2023-08-18T07:26:48-06:00	(#hshhn3q) 😮 I didn't know of that kind of problem... I hope you find a doctor soon!   And on the word, Augenheilkunde  sounds too foreign to me 😅. Here everything is -logist (from Greek), I think we just got used to it 👓 But yeah... Eyes doctor, throat doctor, and so on, would be much better.  https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augenheilkunde
2023-08-14T15:54:53-06:00	(#uxin77a) Gotcha! Indeed the BIP39 has an interesting proposal on how to do that: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#motivation  I've been thinking about (and haven't solved it) how to manage strings with a binary representation not being of exactly multiples of 32. Maybe filling the string with NUL chars (U+0000)? 🤔
2023-08-14T10:09:03-06:00	Last week on Gemini there was a discussion about Text-based (TUI) audio and music players.  Do you use any?  I'm quite happy with musikcube on Win10, and Minimalist on Android.
2023-08-12T21:57:51-06:00	(#xuegdaa) 👀 interesting, I should play with it soon, thanks for sharing! 
2023-08-11T15:28:46-06:00	(#ee63oea) and just asking for the sake of the conversation, why not using a longer passphrase instead of that complex password in the first place? It would have higher entropy 🤔  https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/password-entropy
2023-08-11T15:17:41-06:00	(#o2itj5a) hehe, yes, it's too deep 😅  What's The tubes BTW? 
2023-08-11T15:14:15-06:00	(#ee63oea) I'm not aware of that kind of tools, but you could try with https://pypi.org/project/bip39/  Perhaps there is something similar in your favorite language. 
2023-08-11T10:18:40-06:00	(#ee63oea) What are you looking for? Inputting a password and getting a mnemonic to remember it easily? And from that mnemonic get the same password?  A quick search on Google gave me many results (indeed it's an interesting problem), although this one caught my attention: DeepMnemonic: Password Mnemonic Generation via Deep Attentive Encoder-Decoder Model https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9064919  I thought it was easier than it sounds 😅

2023-08-09T10:41:51-06:00	(#r2n2n2q) Not a bad option, although now we need a phone with camera, a printer, a QR reader app, to name a few... And don't let get started with usability issues of QR codes (like restaurant menus)  My idea is to make it easy to backup keys with pen and paper 🖋 📄 without copying the hexadecimal string which is prone to error 👀
2023-08-08T12:10:34-06:00	Ha! Today I found on `twtxt-php` that the same CSS/HTML is wrapping the long URLs differently on Edge and Firefox (on Win10). I pushed a quick fix, but I got to check again on Mobile.  #weirdinessOfWebDev
2023-08-08T11:46:22-06:00	Today I'm reading about how to save a copy of your secret keys outside a computer, using analog media, or sharing it by voice. For instance, for TOTP authenticators.  I found BIP39 coming from the crypto-wallets world: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki  The user has to write down this passphrase > fragile mimic expect ketchup truth between thunder visit expose output powder derive process disagree razor Which is carefully designed to be checksummed and it's easy to say on a call  Finally deriving it into a set of bytes like > da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709  Do you know some alternatives not related to cryptocurrencies? 🤔

2023-08-07T09:04:59-06:00	Around 2015 I bought an Arduino Uno to make a Ping-Pong scoreboard, although never finished the project. The idea was to create a kind of leaderboard or ranking for that table tennis board in a shared office,  I found that Arduino in the monthly cleaning... Could you suggest some use for it? I don't throw it away, although I know it's extremely limited.

I read "The Videogame Industry Does Not Exist", deep and insightful. And "The Stuff Games Are Made Of", by an academic creator I like, is slightly presumptuous, but insightful as well.
2023-08-07T08:53:17-06:00	Here is an interesting link for today:  Plato and the Nerd: The Creative Partnership of Humans and Technology https://archive.org/details/mit_press_book_9780262341202/
2023-08-03T10:25:03-06:00	(#ckwbdwq) Disclaimer: Although I know the basis, I'm not an expert by any means. I like twtxt even with its disadvantages, blockchains are an interesting technology but it's difficult to love them, although I'm not radicalized as I have written before. I don't hate blockchains b/c I don't want to spend my energy hating them.  So, when technology, monetary power, decision-making, and other sensitive topics are put together, it's tricky to have a single definition. A quick search on 'Distributed vs Decentralized' gave: > Decentralized systems offer power to the many, not just the few. > [...] Distributed systems can enable resource sharing and improve efficiency and performance. These systems can function with or without a central authority.  From the first result on Google: https://www.hivenet.com/post/decentralized-or-distributed-whats-the-big-difference  ChatGPT says: > [...] While both federated and decentralized platforms involve distributed systems, they differ in terms of control and decision-making. [...] The key characteristic of a distributed platform is the distribution of workload and data across multiple nodes, allowing for parallel processing and faster response times.   From a long response of about 3,500 characters. It's not a simple topic to grasp.  Why Google and GPT? I think those are the first sources for many people now. Perhaps not the most trustable sources if you ask me.   So I think having your vision on the topic would be enlightening. But losing it in the emerging flow of twts would be a shame.
2023-08-03T10:12:59-06:00	(#ohrlr6a) When I talk about twtxt with friends, usually that question emerges.  What's the difference between Federated, Distributed, and Decentralized?... And also the difference between platforms, systems, services, and such. I remember we discussed that a few months ago.  I think you should have a post in your blog or similar as a future reference.
2023-08-03T10:09:25-06:00	(#nqcozgq) Well, smol.pub has some unique features for the smol net community: From the main page: > Smol Pub is tiny blogging service. >    Web interface and CLI to manage your posts. >    Accessible from Web, Gemini and Gopher. >    Storage for your images. >    Write custom CSS for web. >    Attach your custom domain with SSL. >    Export your posts. >    No JavaScript, ads, or tracking technology.  I was using Gohugo and it was so painful to start writing, and push the HTML to the server, that I stopped writing. It was almost impossible to fix a typo on my phone or simply push a quick text. Smol.pub is a typical blogging platform but compatible with Gemini, has a customizable interface and it just works. And although is too simplistic, Gemtext works for me as an alternative to Markdown.  I wrote a bit about that here: https://text.eapl.mx/writing-in-2021
2023-08-02T18:28:17-06:00	(#kwnxdia) That's neat! I don't know what are you thinking of exactly. Yarn Pods?  As an example, my blog is 'hosted' on smol.pub with a perpetual key for 5 USD. I think that's subsidized, m15o is paying to keep the lights on. But I like this service so much, that paying 0.5 or 1 dollar per month is nothing!  Compared with the effort of paying 2-5 USD/month for a VPS, setting up a Go environment, updating dependencies in a language I don't master, tweaking things, and maintaining everything for a personal smol.pub instance. I tried to run it once, and I quit after a few hours.
2023-08-02T18:17:53-06:00	(#iaiqdeq) It could be interesting. As has been discussed, these services are 'centralized', although having mirrors hosted by volunteers syncing somehow, would be a good idea. So if one server disappears you can jump to another.  I lost track of Registries, but they seem to be down, which is an example of that problem: https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/registry.html  And I'm aware of this kind of CSVs made by 'scraping a social graph', but they seem to be manually updated: https://github.com/tkanos/we-are-twtxt
2023-08-02T15:14:43-06:00	(#nrtxtpa) what do you have in mind? I was using 6 USD servers from Digital Ocean, but saw that on Vultr they start at 2.5 USD.  VPS are great to learn, although paying a dollar for a service with no maintenance makes sense to me by all the time we save. The problem exists when you don't use the service that much and have to pay anyway. 
2023-08-02T14:35:00-06:00	(#wwkox7q) there are many, many improvements on that logo  This is a good transitional one, IMO https://pixelresort.gumroad.com/l/twitter-x

2023-08-01T14:15:33-06:00	(#f3v3ufq) it also happened for my yarn Pod.  Paying for a service you are not using (that much) is a weird feeling.  But it's a weird feeling too not paying for a service you are using 😆 
2023-08-01T14:10:07-06:00	What would be a good icon for `twtxt`?  I chose the hash emoji #️⃣, which has many variations: https://emojipedia.org/keycap-number-sign/  and I liked the tweoji one, I think it has a good license: CC-BY 4.0/MIT https://github.com/twitter/twemoji#license  It would be nice to choose an Emoji/Image/Icon as a convention. What do you say?
2023-08-01T13:31:06-06:00	(#myjczaq) Killing a personal VPS, created like 8 years ago, requires some mourning, strangely enough.
2023-08-01T13:26:51-06:00	(#ricslja) And now I'm watching that recognition of valid links like eapl.me and 8.2 is broken on twtxt-php 😅 #ohMyGosh #prayForMeAgain
2023-08-01T13:16:58-06:00	After breaking my VPS, and deciding to kill it, now eapl.me is up again, but with a Ionos shared hosting. twtxt-php on PHP 8.2 is working (after a few fixes), and I need to lift a few services more.

2023-07-30T15:05:03-06:00	(#6zukyvq) Hey! How are you doing? I'm checking that a few of your twts are still dated in a future time. For example, this one I'm replying to appears to me like 16 minutes after the current time.  I got to say that I implemented that possibility just for your twtxt feed, so it's not a big deal 😛
2023-07-30T15:01:40-06:00	Enough of controversial topics for today. Let's go back to the garden. 🌱  Have a good weekend everyone!
2023-07-30T15:00:33-06:00	(#r63zi7a) I dislike many things about Web3 (not to be confused with Web 3.0). Decentralization is not one of the reasons, but the interests behind since they are not sustainable, in my opinion.  To know why I dislike it, I had to use it. Briefly used https://3speak.tv since a few Latin 'YouTubers' I followed, said they were migrating to those platforms as they were earning more than the benefits from Ad impressions and Subscriptions, with less effort. They were receiving 'likes' more like a tips model. "I like your content, create more, take a dollar". All my content on YouTube is for free, so sincerely don't know if that's true, or if it was for a short period of time, but _may_ be right.
2023-07-30T14:41:21-06:00	(#dr3xrwq) In this kind of exercises, I like to propose some alternatives.  Perhaps instead of using TW/FB with my students, I could motivate them to join twtxt, run their own servers, and host their own data. Teaching them how to make money without the dependence of giant corporations, which is not easy, but it's feasible.  Well, that's all that was on my mind, but it's always an interesting topic to discuss with my friends while we drink a beer 🍻 or a good wine 🍷. Cheers!
2023-07-30T14:37:52-06:00	(#dndgwsq) So, many new technologies were created on top of that 'good' system. Proof-of-stake, Proof of authority, Proof of weight, and many more. They are re-centralizing a decentralized system to hold monetary value (not digital cash, since that's another topic).  Finally, when we mix a social network/media/platform with all those abstract technologies developed in the last 15 years to hold monetary value, we are in a crazy world of unfulfilled promises, but which people want. I understand why that exists. Why generative AI is a trend now. Why Crypto was told as a future, and such.  So, answering the question: > How many people truly believe blockchain social networks are the future?  I think there is a significant amount of people. I saw it at events and conferences. If many people believe in that, and somehow benefit from it, it's enough to start a movement. I've seen that in traditional streaming, video game stores, Roblox, and many more.  I think that Social media is toxic enough when attention and personal information are sold in exchange for a fun platform, and a free way to get in contact with friends and family. But also it's a tool for companies, big and small to sell stuff, which starts as something good, a way for small creatives to earn money from their craftsmanship. But as has been discussed, soon an enshittification process begins.  > As if likes, upvotes, hearts, and subscriptions weren’t narcissistic enough, let’s make people think someone wants to pay them with crypto to view their random posts online.  I'm with you on this idea. It _could_ be a pyramid. But the promise of earning real money also happens with traditional platforms (Meta, TikTok and such). When real money (or crypto money, or worthless digital points) is in the equation, strange behaviors start to appear in creators and followers.
2023-07-30T14:22:22-06:00	(#r63zi7a) Hmmm... That's a pretty sensitive topic here, so I don't know if you want to read different ideas... And we could write a whole book, but for the sake of intellectual discussion, let's throw some points here.  Disclaimer: I briefly worked for a small crypto company in 2021 on the controversial Pay-to-win model using Enjin, Ethereum, and such. I received payments on crypto and paid people in other countries, being cheaper and easier than national services. I don't think I'm a crypto-bro, and I don't want to work in that area anymore.  I don't like to say "everything X is evil" or "everything Y is good", based on beliefs, ideology, and tech-religion. But people need those. Even I need something to believe in. Decentralization is my current value. I think that's the radical point of Crypto vs Not-Crypto.  "You are with us, or against us."  As a technology, blockchain is, IMO, an amazing tool for decentralization, excuse the comparison, similar to BitTorrent. Proof of Work is problematic and it's showing that when many people use it, it's an environmental disaster.

It's available here: https://github.com/eapl-gemugami/phpub2twtxt  I'm thinking of renaming the project and moving it outside of Github to make it more friendly for the community (Sourcehunt perhaps?). But for now, you can find the crafted version for myself in that repo. 
2023-07-29T15:24:29-06:00	(#2fo7y6q) Well, I use Meta's services about once a week to contact people who only use FB, IG, and WA (developers from my country on Groups, friends on Messenger, and family). Here everyone uses Whatsapp 24/7 for work and leisure, and mobile carriers offer free access to Meta apps, so it's difficult to avoid using those 😅  I'm not a pictures person, so I push like 1 photo a year, but I adore microblogging: https://text.eapl.mx/microblogging  I use each service based on the kind of people I'm talking to, mainly to start conversations or share thoughts. Twitter was like the default for creativity and arts 🎨💻, the reach and discovery of new people and content is decent (based on followers only), but a lot of people moved to Masto due to recent problems we all know.  No one uses Threads here (luckily) and I like twtxt a lot, but none of my close friends are here (yet) 😬
2023-07-29T14:46:24-06:00	(#tdjzg2q) well, this fork of `pubtwtxt` (web app to push twts to your twtxt file) has too many changes and different goals now (self-hosting a micro Web platform for a single user), that perhaps it should have a different name like `twtxt-php` 🤔

2023-07-29T14:41:09-06:00	A quick update to the twtxt-php client, now you can watch a twts for a user I'm following like: https://eapl.me/twtxt/?twts=https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt
2023-07-28T22:55:27-06:00	(#6mgvdoa) oops, you mean watching only the twts from a .txt or a user. That's also a hidden feature but I can't recall where it is 😅
2023-07-28T22:51:58-06:00	(#wtonnrq) of course! I haven't given myself time to document nor implement, but I hope finishing classes there is more focus for that...   Anyway, any suggestions are welcome! 
2023-07-28T22:46:00-06:00	(#6mgvdoa) well, the idea for that project is to self-host your personal interface to twtxt, more than having a server for many people.  Anyway, there is an undocumented feature to see someone else's timeline https://eapl.me/twtxt/?url=https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt  But it's not finished yet, so it only shows some of the followers
2023-07-28T18:37:07-06:00	(#red3neq) Love the colours 🌇 !
2023-07-28T18:35:36-06:00	Yeah! This thing is loading Markdown links and images now 😄  https://eapl.me/twtxt/?hash=red3neq
2023-07-28T17:55:59-06:00	A really interesting analysis of how to improve a micro-blogging platform based on user impressions:  Mastodon is easy and fun except when it isn’t - Erin Kissane's small internet website https://erinkissane.com/mastodon-is-easy-and-fun-except-when-it-isnt
2023-07-28T17:54:39-06:00	Finally Friday! What are you doing this weekend?
2023-07-28T16:12:40-06:00	(#gu5qfla) It sounds to me like those limits on password length... Like below 16 chars 🤨  And it happened as well with the CLI tool I used: https://github.com/rsc/2fa  So I had to make another on Python to support more chars (and to improve the fuzzy search like on some mobile apps). Is anyone interested in that? Could be useful for you.
2023-07-28T16:10:15-06:00	I'm really surprised that some TOTP/2FA apps like Google Authenticator only support 6 or 8 digits, and even Aegis only supports 10. I know it could break things to allow 12 or 16, but... Come on! Is not that hard to allow any reasonable number!
2023-07-28T11:56:23-06:00	Ha, this is amazing 😆 Now I have to find a use for it =P  https://thecanine.itch.io/winluncher
2023-07-28T11:45:57-06:00	(#7dahtfa) And I added a reference implementation for Hash extension on PHP  https://github.com/eapl-gemugami/phpub2twtxt/blob/master/docs/03-hash-extension.md
2023-07-28T10:59:29-06:00	(#kuz6cra)  > Hey tell me about this I found on your feed? 🙏   Sure! By the way it would be great to have your thoughts!  I have started drafting those here: https://github.com/eapl-gemugami/phpub2twtxt/blob/master/docs/02-metadata-extension.md  Those are: emoji (like on Gemini Station, an emoji instead of an image), lang (default language for every twt in the file, or specific for a single twt, like on Masto), version (to indicate which version of twtxt spec the txt file is using).  And I was checking that the hashing spec is prone to be extended from 7 characters to 10 or 11, so it would be great to know when that would happen.  Nice to greet you!
2023-07-27T12:08:45-06:00	I'm reading "Everything is F*cked: A Book about Hope" again. An uncomfortable reading on why we need hope and how we try to achieve it. It makes me think a lot about my biases, public and private...  Well, I think it's moment to start finishing the work week and prepare for the weekend. 🤨  
2023-07-27T12:03:34-06:00	Today I found new -isms: Decentralism, federalism, centralism, distributism...  Interesting how information collides with politics and ideology 🤔 Buuut, that's nothing to worry about (yet).
2023-07-26T15:11:54-06:00	Could we replace traditional passwords with One Time Passwords? We should start switching from 6 digits to many more, 10 at least or 16.  TOTP and lookup secrets as first factor authentication https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2979
2023-07-26T12:32:48-06:00	(#3o3xcjq) also, the new medication is making me sleep a lot... I'll take the opportunity to do so 😴
2023-07-26T12:31:31-06:00	I've been really disconnected from twtxt due to work. Working on ETLs and Python all day long.  Not that bad, although I don't want to work on the PHP client that much. Anyway, it has the min features to take a conversation, so it works as a minimalist client. 😅
2023-07-24T17:19:34-06:00	What was the most surprising thing you found this weekend?
2023-07-18T10:29:47-06:00	(#3j2t5gq) Well, I'm watching these games are still alive in Japan! 😮  https://www.wikiwand.com/en/GuitarFreaks_and_DrumMania#GITADORA_to_GITADORA_HIGH-VOLTAGE_(2013%E2%80%93present)
2023-07-18T10:23:59-06:00	Why have rhythm games, like DrumMania stopped being popular? Is it due to the disappearance of arcade places?  I random song I found these days: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZgN5rhrx9M
2023-07-17T17:37:14-06:00	(#fiqgsba) It's looking nice!
