2022-11-14T22:06:01Z	(#leibt5a) @<algorifer https://twtxt.net/user/algorifer/twtxt.txt> I'm working on an integrated full text and keyword search engine directly into `yarnd` which will replace the current (crappy) tag-only search. This will allow us to index an archive (optional, as some archives are rather large) and give us full search capability and do interesting things like pull up old conversations (yarns) from the index (but explicitly as we'll likely continue to use the cache model with limited size and ttl for good reasons).
2022-11-14T22:06:48Z	(#rz32kja) @<akoizumi https://social.kyoko-project.wer.ee/user/akoizumi/twtxt.txt> I _think_ this is true of just about any non-trivial "tech" these days, for example cars.

2022-11-15T00:35:59Z	(#6f66klq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Actually you are _somewhat_ right about and I empathise with your point of view. As much as I believe in what we've built here, I also recognise its not for everyone. The "masses" (as we call 'em) are (as you say) truly lost. It is next to impossible to pry them away from all this centralised privacy eroding garbage as they almost just "don't get it".‚Ä®‚Ä®I've found myself saying in conversations with my wife and friends and family, with the increase in data branches, that we will only start to question the way things are and where our data is stored and with whom, only (and only if) it started to hurt a lot more than it already is.‚Ä®‚Ä®With the recent branches of Optus and Medibank here in Australia, Australians are starting to feel the pain of identity fraud, theft, increased difficulty in dealing with institutions (like taking your own money out of a bank!) and so on...
2022-11-15T01:04:39Z	So I discovered (get it? ü§£) that there is a Twtxt feed out there that is otherwise identical but are served as two different feeds with a different `# url = ` field for some strange reason, even though the content is literally identical üòÖ‚Ä®‚Ä®You can see what I mean by poking around these two twts: [#jbsw56q](https://twtxt.net/twt/jbsw56q) and [#bekvqja](https://twtxt.net/twt/bekvqja)‚Ä®‚Ä®Basically if you're going to serve your feed over different protocols or a different URL on the same protocol/scheme, you _really_ should use the same `# url =` (Hashing URI as per the [spec](https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/twthashextension.html)) ü§ó

2022-11-15T06:18:20Z	(#klyuyhq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Your comments around maintaining your "filter bubble" and "being able to keep up" are things I _think_ we should try to find good ways and tools to manage. I too like the filter bubble I've created around myself (so far) and probably want to mostly keep it that way (more or less). Yes keeping up is getting harder, which has driven me to work on and experiment with "Filtering".‚Ä®‚Ä®I don't really see Twtxt / Yarn.social as a "social media" per se, I see it more of an ecosystem and an easy way to get a "thought" or two out there with some familiar things (of course) borrowed from "social media". Remember that I _think_ much of the same concepts really predated the likes of Twitter/Facebook anyway (finger? Status.net? and others...) so the "sour taste" we have is maybe ill placed?‚Ä®‚Ä®Anyway, let's keep trying to make something good ü§ó

2022-11-16T01:24:12Z	(#nkrwwha) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> Yes but that won't matter as the Feeds service will basically poll the RSS feed and track it over time writing new Twts into the Twtxt feed üëå -- This _would_ already work as-is if you just shove in the `.rss` URI, but I'm going to add first-class support for this with something like: `mastodon:user@server`

2022-11-19T12:44:54Z	(#z2wiqfq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Yeah as we discussed in the call, I _think_ I might switch this to use a UNIX timestamp instead with seconds precision. Because the feeds' metadata are dynamically generated I have to do handle feed rotation and linking with the `prev` field more programatically I guess üòÖ
2022-11-19T12:48:38Z	(#g2fh7na) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Hmm looks like you found a bug with indexing conversations that spanned across the time when we switch from `#<xxxx url>` to just `#xxxx` ü§î I'll have to debug this...
2022-11-19T13:03:36Z	Hmm I _think_ my feed hit the `--max-fetch-limit` size and I don't think `yarnd` deals with this dynamically when its reached, only in a daily background job ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2022-11-19T13:55:57Z	And I'm back üòÖ
2022-11-19T13:58:23Z	(#g75bo5a) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> It's a good visualisation and great explanation üëå
2022-11-19T14:11:34Z	(#g75bo5a) The _problem_ is Mastodon is _really_ a "distributed" network, not _really_ "decentralised" per se, it is and is isn't in the strictest sense. Instances get far too large, and you can see what happens when they grow even larger, they strain and struggle to keep up with the load and traffic on them.‚Ä®‚Ä®Blocking bad instances is necessary, but it wouldn't be as necessary if instances were much smaller IMO.
2022-11-19T14:12:41Z	(#jwiefuq) So @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I _think_ Have to also improve `yarnd`'s feed rotation to do something like preserve up to `--max-cache-size` twts in the main feed, otherwise the cache gets a bit "empty" with unexpected behaviour üò¢

2022-11-21T05:37:18Z	Key @<Kevin https://oh.mg/twtxt.txt> I was trying to improve the way external feeds are cached and handled as well as their avatars. Removing duplicates, reducing memory footprint, etc. I noticed your feed is served over 3 different protocols `https`, `gopher` and `gemini`. I also noticed you moved your feed's primary URL (the one we consider for Twt Hashes) from `https://om.gay/text/twtxt.txt` to `https://txt.om.gay/twtxt.txt`‚Ä®‚Ä®However when I try to access the these feeds I see a different (first) `# url = ` value at the top:‚Ä®‚Ä®- https://gopher.mills.io/oh.mg/0/twtxt.txt‚Ä®- https://om.gay/text/twtxt.txt‚Ä®‚Ä®The first one shows:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®# url = https://txt.om.gay/twtxt.txt‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®Whilst the 2nd one shows:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®# url = https://om.gay/text/twtxt.txt‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®This makes clients confused üòÖ

2022-11-21T22:48:51Z	(#vh5pwrq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Is right here, as much as I'm strongly opinionated on the subject, there is no "hard" and "fast" (right or wrong) rule here. There are only "rules of thumb", "guidelines" and "experience".‚Ä®‚Ä®And as @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> nicely points out, the _real_ problem is likely the exponential effect of dependencies. Fortunately or unfortunately (depending on how you look at it) libraries can also have dependencies (and good language really will support this), but the thing we often refer to as "dependency hell" comes from this "exponential dependency tree" that we inevitably see in ecosystems like NodeJS / NPM (are there other examples? I _feel_ like I pick on NodeJS / NPM too much ü§£)
2022-11-22T00:12:06Z	(#vh5pwrq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Thankfully less so in Go, because of the culture around the language, but I _used_ to feel this way about Python too once upon a time, I _feel_ like languages and ecosystems get "populated" with ideas from every other language/ecosystem over time and eventually reach a state of "chaos"? ü§î As an example, Go now supports generics as of Go 1.19, something I'm not really all that thrilled with really as it adds unnecessary complexity to the language IMO that isn't really needed.

You don't have to declare every variable's type, the compiler will infer this pretty much most of the time. The only time I define types are structs, interfaces and global variables or a locally scoped variable I intend to assign later.

2022-11-26T09:46:26Z	(#c7ky5ya) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Nah the tall tent bit is basically the main roof, it sits nice and hover over the centre of the trailer. It unfolds forwards (_hence why its called a forward folding camper trailer_) onto itself and the front section near the tow hitch is where you'll find a queen(ish) sized bed for @<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> and myself üëå The section has a full 270deg leather(ish) couch (i.e: 3 sides) then the back has a slide-out section that holds a double(ish) bed.‚Ä®‚Ä®Outside (once you walk out the door in the middle) you'll find a fridge drawer on your right. On your left you'll find a pull-out full 4-burner gas stove, sink with running water, a cutlery drawer and metal board on the side of the burner stove.‚Ä®‚Ä®Towards the back (on the right) there are extra hot and cold water plugs and an extra gas fitting for a portable (stands up) gas hot water system (with a very long hose and multi-function shower head) that feeds back into the kitchen as well.
2022-11-26T09:48:53Z	(#c7ky5ya) Then basically on the other side (opposite the door) is a small storage area for the battery (which has enough room left over for my portal 240w foldable solar blanket), in the middle another storage box for the circuit breaker (with enough space for a plastic box with my solar panel's long cable, MPPT charge controller and Power Meter), then finally a towards the front a larger storage area for the hot water system (normally stored in a bad) and the portable port-a-loo (toilet).
2022-11-26T09:52:57Z	(#pysczza) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> So I wanted to reply to this Yarn with some comments, but wasn't able to _really_ do so whilst out 'n about camping with the family üòÖ -- Basically Go's modules (_the more recent version_) is actually pretty good. Let me try to help you understand the basics of it...‚Ä®‚Ä®When defining a new package/library, run `go mod init git.mills.io/prologic/foo` (_as an example_). This could also be `github.com/prologic/foo` or anywhere else with a publicly accessible Git source. I recommend this as the _easiest_ as things will "just work"‚Ñ¢.‚Ä®‚Ä®Next, **never** do development in `$GOPATH` as this is basically deprecated and gone now. Always code outside of `$GOPATH` and use modules as per above.‚Ä®‚Ä®Finally if you are not ready to publish your work and you depend on `foo` and `bar` and maybe something else too (_like Yarn.social's codebase_) then use `$ go mod edit -replace git.mills.io/prologic/foo /User/prologic/Projects/foo` (_as an example_).

Maybe its the love of money and power that's gotten to his late of late? ü§î I dunno ü§î I'd love to have even a small fraction of that kind of money just to a) understand what its like and b) prove that you don't have to be an asshole or a self-important narcissist (I hate this about "people" that get into positions of "power", such self-important BS)
2022-11-29T23:10:36Z	(#dyafgqq) Anyway this a perfect example of what I see as "information warfare", who do you believe? Elon or his ex-wife?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Also why in da fuq would you use a child's (short) life to prop yourself up?! ü§¨ I mean fuck c'mon Elon, grow the fuck up, I'm a father of two young beautiful daughters, I can **never**, **ever** doing that kind of shit.

2022-11-30T01:56:06Z	(#pkyf3cq) @<jim_milton https://twtxt.net/user/jim_milton/twtxt.txt> Easy! You have to provide the Username + Email you used in the "Password Reset" form. If you forget your Email address, or no longer hav access to it, too bad, not possible to recover your account.

2022-12-01T03:34:32Z	(#lwj2rdq) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> I don't think so. What we _should_ do is teach our children social etiquette, both online and offline. Teach them about abuse, that can occur both in the real world and in the online world (they are basically the same). Teach them about data privacy and security. And so on...
2022-12-01T03:37:07Z	(#v55m6bq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> That's what I call it "Information Warfare". There are entire (scurrilous) business who pay money to others to promote "misinformation" or "propaganda".

2022-12-01T22:39:16Z	(#mo74zdq) I don't think that's a reason to ban social media for children under the age of 18 though because it's nothing to do with social media
2022-12-01T22:40:35Z	(#awgezma) this is why I went building the software behind Yarn.social I felt that it was important that pods didn't actually permanently leave posts around -- or at least make it more difficult and an explicit action to bring up alt content
2022-12-01T22:43:42Z	(#jrkneoa) my children are allowed to use the Internet. Mostly, some things I do, explicitly block, but otherwise they trust us enough to ask, and we supervise and help them in their learning of online activities.
2022-12-01T22:52:37Z	(#jrkneoa) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> I use  [AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome: Network-wide ads ](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) and enable most filters and add some custom ones too.

In other words, break compatibility in such a way that Yarn.social no longer uses or is compatible with Twtxt.‚Ä®‚Ä®As much as I _really_ don't want to do this, and never intended for this to happens, the question has to be asked.

2022-12-20T02:59:22Z	(#w6f7o7a) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> That's a really good question. We probably need to evaluate the reasons why we would... Currently Yarn.social is really a landing page for a community of Twtxt clients, Specifications and Extensions that all work together nicely. There are numerous implementations and more being discovered all the time. -- However if the hostility from (shall we call) "Twtxt" purists continues, I see no other choice but to pack up everything we've done and hard fork and break away.‚Ä®‚Ä®Or is there a 3rd option I don't see? ü§î -- I _think_ the hardest part of all this is the amount of work, energy and effort we have all poured into this project and community only to have it [thrown back in our face](https://twtxt.net/twt/c6yyvda) üò¢ -- Work/Energy/Effort (btw) that is completely FREE (as in freedom of choice) and free as in voluntarily created, maintained and costs $0.00 to anyone.

2022-12-20T03:45:24Z	(#jxnfaoa) @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> I have to ask...‚Ä®‚Ä®> Actually what he doesn‚Äôt like, is the fear that you may extend the protocol and once it‚Äôs adopted by everybody, make it proprietary and oblige everybody to only uses your platform. (here https://brainshit.fr/read/242)‚Ä®‚Ä®How?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How in the hell do you turn an open spec (Twtxt and Extensions) into something "proprietary". They are already open sourced and licensed under the terms of the MIT License. They ar archived by the Internet Archive. There is no way to go back on this.‚Ä®‚Ä®Many clients are also MIT licensed or similar as well (`yarnd` specifically is AGPLv3 but for a reason).‚Ä®‚Ä®The simple fact is this... (And the nice thing), Twtxt clients of any kind are really just that, a client. There is no protocol (never has been), only a specification and extensions. You just host a feed using any HTTP, Gopher or Gemini server.‚Ä®‚Ä®So therefore Twtxt / Yarn is 100% **decentralised** -- in the truest sense.‚Ä®‚Ä®It is _not_ possible to do what @<lucidiot http://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> fears (worries) about in the first place.
2022-12-20T03:47:06Z	(#jxnfaoa) Or rather that is to say... How the hell do you make a truely decentralised ecosystem "proprietary" in the first place?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I cannot think of any example of this -- This is why _most_ (if not all?) profitable "social media"(s) are all "centralised" systems or "distributed networks", so they retain control.‚Ä®‚Ä®Yarn.social / Twtxt (the ecosystem) has very little to no control over anything. In fact the extensions themselves were a formalisation of what the community was (as you clearly point out) doing and still is doing.
2022-12-20T03:47:54Z	I'm going to be so bold as to claim:‚Ä®‚Ä®> You cannot turn an existing decentralised open source ecosystem into a proprietary one.‚Ä®‚Ä®Not possible.

2022-12-20T04:12:28Z	(#aej5m2q) @<win0err https://kolesnikov.se/twtxt.txt> Sorry I didn't see your @-mention until now. So sorry for the late reply. The thing is pretty much every single extension was the formalisation of what was already happening in the ecosystem and community (which at the time was largely dead). -- The _only_ exception is the [Twt Hash Extension](https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/twthashextension.html) (_which was also created by e member of the cummunity and the community agreed and we formalised that too_) in order to support "proper threading".‚Ä®‚Ä®We generally have discussed as a community ideas of changing how this works, but we can never agree on why we should change it or how it would be better designed. I actually didn't come up with the design, some other very clever person did, and the thing is it gives us unique and interesting properties that clients can use for various display purposes that you cannot get any other way. Namely that each Twt and the calculated Hash are "content addressable".
2022-12-20T04:13:44Z	(#aej5m2q) @<win0err https://kolesnikov.se/twtxt.txt> So as long as you have a "decent client" (_for various definition of_) that has some kind of cache and/or long-term storage, you can easily use the same calculations and hash and form your own display of the same "threads" that can span many feeds.
2022-12-20T04:15:11Z	(#aej5m2q) For example [jenny](https://www.uninformativ.de/git/jenny/file/README.html) creates Maildir email threads out of them I believe and then you can use [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) to interact with your Twtxt feeds which then fully supports the Twt Hash and Twt Subject exts very nicely (and many Jenny uses do use Mutt).

Let's say for arguments sake an average "Cloud Native Application" costs you around ~$50 per year, and an average service ~$5 per month. Let's say you have a few of these...

2022-12-20T09:25:07Z	(#thst6wq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I am too. Breaking compatibility or coming up with something completely different to what we already have, and what is already pretty simple would just makes things harder for ordinary folks. What I _think_ we need to largely continue with is hiding much of the complexities away we have today without any new (or very few) additions in terms of specs/extensions or modifications thereof. For example, maybe `yarnd` (as one client) doesn't have to care about "managing feed aliases" for what a user follows. Maybe we can just automagically work that shit out and not worry about this whole mess of having to rename a feed you follow or unfollow/refollow it just because someone decided to change their `# nick = ` field üòÖ

2022-12-20T11:36:04Z	(#mpi3j6q) @<win0err https://kolesnikov.se/twtxt.txt> And FWIW, a single pod will only fetch your feed once per cache refresh interval, regardless of how many users on that pod (pods are by default multi-user pods) follow you.

2022-12-20T17:17:11Z	(#ee7jksq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> Sadly the simple fact here is; We can debate this part of the spec until the cows come home (_a silly English/Australian expression_). There is just no way to agree on this at all. IMO it should be removed from the spec entirely. `yarnd` (as one client) for example just makes this configurable, ful-stop, with a reasonable default value that has been discussed and widely agreed upon by the community at least twice now.
2022-12-20T17:19:10Z	(#c6yyvda) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> You are right on both counts and yes I did say this and of course I still believe its true üëå That aside, calling our community and project (what should become a foundation when I have the money, with you guys driving it!) is not right though ü§ó

I guess I can also understand the "worries" (as unfounded as they are) too, especially coming from your perspective. As you say though (thank you üôè) Yarn.social is a far cry from this situation.‚Ä®‚Ä®All along we started out with:‚Ä®‚Ä®> What is the community doing now, what has it always done, what does it want to do.‚Ä®‚Ä®And we formalised that.‚Ä®‚Ä®At the same time we built what is now called `yarnd`, or Yarn.social Pod(s). Aside from the fact it is both decentralised and distributed and uses Twtxt, and all the Extensions, as well as IndieAuth, Atom, WebMentions and WebSub (all open source protocols and specifications, most of which are from the "Small Web") there's nothing special going on -- `yarnd` is just a multi-user client and implementation of the specs.‚Ä®‚Ä®My only goal has always been (and unlikely to change) to bring the simplicity of Twtxt to the masses (I think you all remember this). Hide the complexities of hosting a feed (as simple as that is for tech savvy folks)...
2022-12-20T17:28:33Z	(#tlse4oq) ... and build what I believe (and have always believed now for the past few years) the best kind of social media. The slow kind, the truly decentralised kind and the one that is easy to reason about and build against.‚Ä®‚Ä®It's just a freka'n text file ü§£
2022-12-20T17:30:43Z	(#tlse4oq) Finally... Even if Yarn.social and `yarnd` instances (Pods) tomorrow were to suddenly be spawned in the thousands, with thousands of users or more, nothing much would change I don't think. We would have scalability problems with the search engine (pretty sure), and at that point _some_ of those pods _might_ be "Hosted Pods" (for a fee), which I'm _hoping_ by then would go back into a "foundation" (yet to be named, TBD) to continue to fund the "foundation" (TBD).
2022-12-20T17:37:54Z	(#w6f7o7a) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> Good points. I personally like to call Yarn.social (and have been for a while now) an "ecosystem'. I'm pretty sure it says this on the [Landing Page](https://yarn.social) too somewhere... At some point (also) in the near future (when funds are available, because apparently its both complex and expensive to setup a not-for-profit / foundation ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), there will also be a foundation (maybe be a different name?)‚Ä®‚Ä®None of this however will have any effect on anything as long as we continue to:‚Ä®‚Ä®- listen to the community‚Ä®- adhere to the Twtxt specifications and Extensions‚Ä®- keep specifications and client up-to-date[^1]‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®[^1]: There is _some_ contention over the use of Markdown in Twts (the Unicode newline literal is documented), however there is no agreement on this.

We used to display only local user posts once upon a time, it got changed (community decided) -- But we can have an option to switch between them and I'll just bring that code back -- Actually its pretty easy to add, just making it conferrable is just fiddly (new options, etc).

2022-12-26T06:31:46Z	(#fovxkya) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> I agree, the patch workflow is a bit complicated (_especially for new users_) and I find it a bit unfriendly too. Having to switch from an Email client to Command-line just to manage reviews and applying patches kind of sucks IMO. -- Some nice way to manage incoming changes and communicate reviews and easily applying those changes would be nicer. -- I even had this stupid idea of pushing patches to a special endpoint that create a new Twt in a per-repo Twtxt feed with a link to the "patch" (via a Web UI) and then you can communicate feedback over your own feeds ü§£ -- Finally a "patch" is either #approved or #rejected and patch manager can look for those tags in the thread and deal with the UI appropriately.

2022-12-26T06:48:07Z	(#hgvenxq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt>  No the command compares your branch and automatically formats a patch containing your changes compared to the branch you specified.
2022-12-26T06:55:34Z	(#fovxkya) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt>  Hmmm not sure ü§î
2022-12-26T07:09:54Z	(#hgvenxq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt>  From the maitainrr side you just end up having to copy the raw contents of the emails and pipe them into `git am -` in the right order. It's a bit tedious ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2022-12-26T07:11:37Z	(#fovxkya) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt>  Hmmm so there isn't a lot you can do with plain Git itself. Even patches sent via email are basisally out-or-band at that point.
2022-12-26T09:35:48Z	(#fovxkya) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> Well what I mean to say is that `git` itself basically just houses some client-side "Metadata" about the repository and a bunch of objects that make up the contents and revision history. For example, there is a special file called `.git/description` that you can edit and there's even `git branch --edit` to edit a branch's description. But none of that is useful beyond a local client. That is to say, if you `git clone` or `git push` none of that information is published anywhere or made available to anyone else.‚Ä®‚Ä®So Git's "distributed data" is limited to well basically its revision history and series of objects I guess? ü§î
2022-12-26T09:37:36Z	(#hgvenxq) @<justamoment https://twtxt.net/user/justamoment/twtxt.txt> Yeah, not only that, but one of the "issues" I have with the whole Git+Email patch workflow in general is that you have to basically "give up" your identity, email address and personal information in some way. I find that a bit bothersome really. -- I'm sure we can come up with a proper "decentralised" way of collaborating on software with `git` as the primary backend for revision history and patches, but hmmm ü§î
2022-12-26T11:23:43Z	(#hgvenxq) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> Yeah so @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> and I are talking on IRC right now about an idea I had about this... I realise I _could_ use the same git patch/diff format(s) but skip the Email parts. I was even thinking of using Twtxt itself as a sort of "notification" and some kind of easy-to-use web-based push/pull system for managing the patches and applying them to your repo(s).

2022-12-26T14:32:41Z	Speaking of Git hosting / forges / thingies... I just realised that the way in which [sr.ht](https://sr.ht) manages patches is _actually_ very similar to what I had in mind, at least conceptually. And... it looks like they somehow have figured out a way to represent whether or not the patches were applied in this nifty Web UI  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/YhuFv2yTNdkMEtd3rxk6QP.png) -- If you follow the link to a [proposed patch](https://lists.sr.ht/~migadu/alps-devel/patches/36196) for example you also get another nice interface explaining how to deal with the patch  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/6AWaky5xWRzaDknFFyAMbk.png) -- As well as a nifty (if you expand it out) little CLI snippet you can paste into your Terminal like:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®$ curl -s https://lists.sr.ht/~migadu/alps-devel/patches/36196/mbox | git am -3‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®Neat! üëå Some good inspiration to draw from there...

2022-12-28T16:05:54Z	(#i4ccvaq) Perhaps its worth for `yarnd` to not have "open registrations" at all ü§î
2022-12-28T16:06:41Z	(#i4ccvaq) I say this because even Gitea instances can sometimes be abused by "assholes" (it happened to mine some time ago, and I've had my fair share of "spam" accounts -- thanks to @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> for helping me clean these up üôè)
2022-12-28T16:10:06Z	(#i4ccvaq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>‚Ä®‚Ä®> We saw a glimpse of this already, with the guy who ‚Äúsoft doxxed‚Äù me. Imagine if 90% of yarn users were doing stuff like that all day every day. I‚Äôd certainly leave pretty quickly‚ÄìI don‚Äôt have time for that, and I don‚Äôt have the free time or the inclination to try to fight it.‚Ä®‚Ä®Yeah I remember, it was a bit of "touch and go" there for us all, but abuse is abuse and as "tetering on the edge" it _might_ have been it was inexcusable. I do wonder though why you'd leave at all? Wouldn't you just Unfollow problematic individuals? ü§î You _could_ even just blacklist the world and maybe just whitelist a few known good feeds, maybe pods even (we haven't built this). -- My point is, escaping people like this is probably hard / next to impossible, all we can do is try to help them (assuming they can be helped at all? ü§î I'm sure some can be helped/saved ü§û), and ensure they don't or cannot abuse the platform (or in our case, the ecosystem)...

2022-12-28T17:07:29Z	(#i4ccvaq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Yup makes sense. We had to build pod-level tools for that, which behave the same way as the per-User muting of a Twt or Feed. It was tough to build and I _actually_ learned something new when doing so with the community's help üòÖ (although I don't like to advertise the feature capability, look at Settings -> Poderator Settings yourself)
2022-12-28T17:12:15Z	(#i4ccvaq) Btw... I'd like to take this opportunity to mention my strong feelings of the fact that Twts/Yarns disappear from pods (on purpose) and have what I _thought_ were pretty sensible defaults (maybe those defaults could be collectively reevaluated?) -- Looking at my own "Muted" list I note that I still have 9 muted Twts and 3 Muted feeds. I could probably cleanup the Muted Twts (as they've probably archived into Bolivian by now, the reason this feature is so important)

2022-12-29T00:45:58Z	(#i4ccvaq) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> To be honest I would prefer that we define things in terms of the problems they sought out to solve. If someone wants to throw up an issue to start the discussion, we can document this with the builtin pages of `yarnd` like in https://twtxt.net/help and in the up and coming [docs.yarn.social](https://docs.yarn.social). For reference `yarnd` has these controls that are noteworthy:‚Ä®‚Ä®- Ephemeral Twts and Yarns (with its cache design, posts are not displayed premaritally on your Timeline or on the Discover view or Front page)‚Ä®- Muting Feeds: You can mute feeds on a per-user basis‚Ä®- Muting Twts and Yarns: You can mute single Twts or entire Yarns (by their hash) on a per-User basic‚Ä®- And finally, full URI patterns of feeds/domains can be "shadow banned" on a Pod basis (which has the effect of filtering out Twts from those feeds/users from the Discover view / Front page, but **not** from users that directly follow them)

2022-12-30T01:53:41Z	(#jieuh3q) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> That's a great question actually. Should we go for multi-user and org/user? Or keep it simple? ü§î What are you thinking here? ü§î
2022-12-30T01:58:11Z	(#jieuh3q) I _think_ if we did support multi-user / multi-org, it would have to be kept deliberately rather simple. That is, it acts basically like a group of repositories and nothing more. Access tokens/keys would still be stored in (for example) `.git/authorized_keys` or `.git/authorized_tokens`
2022-12-30T02:01:14Z	(#jieuh3q) OTOH if we continued to abstract out more of `yarnd`'s codebase, in theory we _could_ basically have a social Git forge/hosting solution that basically uses Twtxt everywhere, including Profiles for Orgs/Users (think Twtxt feed preamble/metadata) and you could follow orgs and users as well as repo logs (or should that be a specialised feed like repo events taht contain things like commit events, merge-request events, etc?)

2023-01-05T12:36:04Z	(#xzi7m6q) I _believe_ it was @<anth http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt> also that recently mentioned in #7xnsrsa his own frustrations with this and suggested maybe we _could_ look at using [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net/) -- Which honestly is probably not really all that hard, it uses (AFIK) a WKD lookup/discovery, not too dissimilar from the one used by [Salty Chat](https://salty.im) üëå
2023-01-05T14:17:37Z	(#xzi7m6q) I've built a client and server library and command-line tool (combination of a bunch of code I found and fixed up): https://git.mills.io/prologic/webfinger‚Ä®‚Ä®I've also implemented an experimental feature called WebFinger (`webfinger`) in [d940da9f05](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/commit/d940da9f05e03a64173ca2f1c9854a0e03fc3d63) which I'm _hoping_ will "just work"‚Ñ¢ ü§û (at least to provide webfinger lookups) -- client-side lookups and discover can come later.
2023-01-05T14:18:36Z	(#qsjny5a) @<loopsaisei https://twtxt.net/user/loopsaisei/twtxt.txt> Hello! üëã Welcome to my pod (one of many!) ü§ó -- Let me try to clear some things up for you...
2023-01-05T14:25:01Z	(#qsjny5a) @<loopsaisei https://twtxt.net/user/loopsaisei/twtxt.txt> Hmmm after having read your Twt properly... Everything you said is _correct_. And you've clearly pointed out some inconsistencies in the two apps we build and maintain and their respective UI/UX üò¢ -- I'm sorry for that. We need help in the mobile app area especially üôè‚Ä®‚Ä®Anyway, yes essentially a Twt Subject is a formalisation of something we discovered in the Twtxt community at the time, so we formalised that into a [Twt Subjec](https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/twtsubjectextension.html) extension.‚Ä®‚Ä®We then later realised that we could have "threading" if we build a way to address and provide clear lookups for a Twt by using content addressable hashes and so built the [Twt Hash](https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/twthashextension.html) extension.‚Ä®‚Ä®So "conversations' (what most of us are now calling yarns, plural of yarn, to basically mean to have a conversation in _some_ parts of the world) are really just chains of Twts across one or more feeds with a Twt Subject that matches a "rooted" Twt Hash.
2023-01-05T14:25:40Z	(#qsjny5a) Forking as you've no doubt found is where things can get interesting as we've had some pretty awesome and insane forks that go many levels deep and span many feeds across many domains, hosts and all around the globe üòÖ

2023-01-05T16:17:33Z	(#xzi7m6q) This is now correctly working rather nicely üëå  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/PRFXcipqYGu9vXS2Yx9KFg.png) -- If anyone wants to give this a try, just `docker pull prologic/yarnd:latest` (if you're running using Docker) or `git pull` and rebuild, then either `--enable-feature webfinger` or add it to Settings -> Poderator Settings and restart (or edit `/path/to/data/settings.yaml`)
2023-01-05T16:19:28Z	(#oovemcq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> According to their own webpage it doesn't look like it would work very well. But to be honest I haven't ever tried it, as it was never a problem before. On my old iMac it never went to sleep -- But I'm pretty sure that's on an older macOS version (before macOS 13.x Ventura)
2023-01-05T16:22:29Z	(#4kw64qq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> In any case I don' think adding `nick` somehow to the JRD (JSOn resource Data?) would really help here anyway. What this _would_ help with however if we got this spec'ed up and into clients is a way to validate @-mentions and feed URI lookups.
2023-01-05T16:25:05Z	(#3vbd6nq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> That's kind of what I'm thinking too. it _might_ be more trouble than it's worth (not to mention that actually using and implementing Activity Pub just seems to be so fucking hard, like NP hard -- Okay I'm slightly joking/exaggerating, but still üòÖ -- At least with the direction we're going, we'll likely just end up with new pods that by default are "invite-only" anyway.
2023-01-05T16:27:02Z	(#ezygx4a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Did you miss #33jt3fa and the subsequent twts in that yarn? ü§î
2023-01-05T16:29:19Z	(#ezygx4a) I guess in general though, it's a pretty good lookup mechanism. I also wrote a command-line tool `webfinger` you can intall with `go install go.mills.io/webfinger/cmd/webfinger@latest` and use like this:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®webfinger prologic@twtxt.net‚Ä®```
2023-01-05T16:33:22Z	(#ezygx4a) I guess its usage in Twtxt clients could be something like this:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®$ webfinger prologic@twtxt.net | jq -r '.links[] | select(.rel=="Self").href'‚Ä®2023/01/06 02:32:40 Looking up WebFinger data for acct:prologic@twtxt.net‚Ä®2023/01/06 02:32:40 GET https://twtxt.net/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct%3Aprologic%40twtxt.net‚Ä®https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®Where a lookup of user@domain would yield the Twtxt feed for that user+domain pair.
2023-01-05T16:34:33Z	(#oovemcq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Yes for Macbooks with batteries, this makes a whole lot of sense üëå For Mac(s), including Mac Studio, Mac mini and Mac Pro, this makes absolutely no sense ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2023-01-05T16:46:39Z	(#4kw64qq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> I kind of agree that we can probably omit the nick part in mentions entirely. Since they can be looked up and cached, there's no need for this. But we'll have to spec this all up. First let's see what @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> and @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> and others like @<anth http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt> thing about finally formalising a standard way to lookup feed URI(s) and define a slightly more saner? @-mention syntax/usage pattern. I for one hate manually typing out (for example) `@<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt>` like this @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> üòÖ
2023-01-05T16:50:20Z	(#ezygx4a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> You can, however that is not a lookup mechanism, more of a publishing standard. And yes all profile pages in `yarnd` implement this, as well as all feeds and the main frontpage discover feed too üëå
2023-01-05T16:51:24Z	(#ezygx4a) Use  [Preview](https://monocle.p3k.io/preview) to check this out on any frontpage of a pod or profile page üëå
2023-01-05T16:52:18Z	(#4kw64qq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Ahh you mean rewrite @-mentions into their fully formed Twtxt mention special URLs? ü§î
2023-01-05T16:53:21Z	(#4kw64qq) I mean yeah sure, `yarnd` already does this today really, based on what's in your "Followings" list on your account, which basically is a mapping of `nick -> url` of the feeds you follow. Really it could just be a simple list and we could drop the nick there too at some point (as again, we can just look them up and cache)
2023-01-05T21:44:34Z	(#oomwkuq) Haha no f**k Apple too üòÜ If it weren't the only desent acccessible OS for a vision impaired person I wouldn't use it ü§£

2023-01-05T21:52:55Z	(#ezygx4a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>  Yeah and I guess the nice thing is `acct:` could mean anything I guess
2023-01-05T21:55:36Z	(#cpewzga) Yeah that's true I guess -- Bit of a downside --  But in theory you could probably do it with a static resource configuration ü§î
2023-01-06T08:59:17Z	(#mf4kvaa) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I'm thinking of generally the case of solving the of "bad data" when ti comes to @-mentions, typos, wrong urls and so on. In general if a client can validate an alias/mention (yes `yarnd` has a similar thing where we maintain a similar mapping per user and have lookup for that), then we can avoid this whole "bad data" mess in the first place. I'd also be interested to know what folks like @<anth http://a.9srv.net/tw.txt> was thinking too when he mentioned the use of [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net). Anyway we'll see how this pans out, `yarnd` (at least my pod) now has an experimental webfinger endpoint where you can do for example `$ webfinger prologic@twtxt.net`
2023-01-06T08:59:46Z	(#mf4kvaa) This probably arrants some real-time conversation though. Are you up for a call this weekend/tomorrow? ü§î
2023-01-06T09:03:20Z	(#756zhuq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I _think_ @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> was probably interested in how this bad mention happened in the first place... So am I actually... Can you shed some light on how this happened? ü§î

2023-01-06T23:37:01Z	(#ugq2bpq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Well if you're still up for it, I would be more than happy to write the client part itself, as a library that you could "just import". I'd probably base it on the code in `yarnd` but heavily refactor it and write a shittone more tests üòÖ Then eventually replace what `yarnd` uses too üëå
2023-01-06T23:37:59Z	(#in2tx6a) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Why? ü§î Clients like `twtr` and `twete` are just so much better üòÖ

2023-01-06T23:43:34Z	(#mf4kvaa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> There are two primary problems that the use of [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net) can help solve (that I can think of):‚Ä®‚Ä®- Conveniently sharing your Yarn.social / Twtxt "identity" with others, much like other competing ecosystems have done. e.g: `prologic@twtxt.net` (which can be looked up now with a webfinger client)‚Ä®- Verifying @-mentions to be correct, potentially even rewriting them (`yarnd` does this anyway) to their proper `@<url>` form(s).

2023-01-07T01:52:43Z	(#kr6624a) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Actually it wouldn't change any of the hashes at all. The old Twts from the previous feed's URI would still remain in-tact. In the case of Yarn.social pods running `yarnd`, they are also archived, the search engine running at [search.twtxt.net](https://search.twtxt.net) running `yarns` would also have indexed them already. Merging an old feed of yours from a different feed URI to a new one would have no impact whatsoever.
2023-01-07T01:54:00Z	(#kr6624a) The _only_ noticeable thing you would see at all is all of a sudden (assuming you followed the old feed and new feed) you would see otherwise identical replies to some "root" that looks like its from two different identifies (feeds)
2023-01-07T04:19:37Z	(#4g3egda) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> It is however an RFC: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7033

2023-01-07T10:37:58Z	(#ajnj4ha) I kind of. have a problem with this:‚Ä®‚Ä®> Don‚Äôt share these addresses.‚Ä®> They contain an identifier that other people could use to send you spam and to control your newsletter subscriptions.‚Ä®‚Ä®How are you suppose to do that when the same identifier is part of the Atom feed's URI?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hmmm ü§î

2023-01-07T10:39:40Z	(#b5w32cq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Hmmm ü§î
2023-01-07T10:41:16Z	(#mf4kvaa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I think the only thing this bus us is "shorter identities" with feed uris that can be looked up and validated, really.
2023-01-07T10:42:21Z	(#mf4kvaa) And this is true, I wouldn't expect every Twtxt feed on ever web server to have a webfinger service. So we'd have to fallback anyway.
2023-01-07T10:43:39Z	(#mf4kvaa) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> If we want to make follow users and cross-pod mentioning easier for users, I _would_ just drop the whole Twtxt feed URi entirely and just use webfinger period. Its far easier for non-technical people to reason about if we do that. Of course the actual Twtxt feed URL(s) are **still** there, just abstracted away from the users.
2023-01-07T10:45:42Z	(#mf4kvaa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Come to think of it, it's actually an appealing "options" thing to support anyway I _think_. It sure does make looking things up a lot easier. It makes no difference to us now, since we all follow each other and have webb established clients and following maps, but if we think another few years from now how things might evolve, new users might appreciate a more "straight forward" mechanisms/lookup and address/identity.
2023-01-07T12:45:30Z	(#5czjhfq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Do you happen to have the feed uri handy? ü§î

2023-01-07T13:49:59Z	(#5czjhfq) Btw... The _only_ reason I can think of this not working as expected, is if the feed in fact hasn't changed at all and so therefore the cached Metadata is unchanged and therefore it believes there is no refresh interval. In order to bust the cache here, the user/feed has to post a Twt or you can Refresh your Pod's Cache.
2023-01-07T13:52:42Z	(#5czjhfq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> It does. But see above.

2023-01-07T23:58:23Z	(#ul5gdnq) For some context, I was trying to work out a way to calculate the moving average of a feed and how often it updates and converge on this. So feeds that update frequently are always fetched at the fetch interval configured by the pod operator (default 5m) and feeds that update slowly are fetched less frequently.
2023-01-07T23:59:13Z	(#ul5gdnq) For cross-pod fetches, this has no effect as pods now should be using WebSub by default (depending on the version) and at some point I _might_ also add WebSub support to the [feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net) service üëå

2023-01-13T20:37:54Z	(#3rhsaxa) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> So... From a practical perspective, wouldn't it make sense to have related identifiers that are "related" to the subject? Hence `rel`? If I were a user, I would expect to lookup only `prologic@twtxt.net` to find both my Yarn and Salty accounts and ways to follow or message me as such.

2023-01-13T20:59:41Z	(#3rhsaxa) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> Yeah I see where you're coming from, and if your Salty IM address is on another domain entirely, then yeah... But if for example you have a Yarn and Salty account on the same domain, and both are for example xuu@sour.is -- I would fully expect to see them both as aliases with respective `rel`(s) no?
2023-01-13T21:00:11Z	(#3rhsaxa) Moreover, what does the upstream spec have to say about this?
2023-01-13T21:01:10Z	(#wd5xdia) Maybe I'll make it my #2023 goal to use less emojis and write less typos!

2023-01-13T23:08:22Z	(#3rhsaxa) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> I'm not so convinced of this "prefixing" here... We're sort of euplidating that extra bit of information anyway in the `rel`(s) -- Maybe @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> is right and we stick to the spirit of the spec and an alias is just that, another identifier that is the same as this one. For example in `yarnd` we could add support in Settings for adding other "identities" that are the same as your, so a webfinger for `prologic@twtxt.net` _could_ also have `prologic@shortcircuit.net.au` and `james@mills.io` as aliases?

2023-01-16T22:44:24Z	(#lbokgna) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Hmm, no it's there now ==> https://anthony.buc.ci/conv/lbokgna‚Ä®‚Ä®Do you follow the Slashdot feed at all? If not, then it _may_ take some time for your pod to fetch the root twt from mine, pods actually try to find the root twt from its peers at random.
2023-01-16T22:48:58Z	(#47clcnq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> You are right, its not just economics that are and have been driving many folks and companies to the so-called proverbial "Cloud"‚Ñ¢ -- What is it then? Convenience? Scale? Flexibility? All these points in my experience are kind of bullshit. Part of me thinks we need to go back to our root and rethink how we've evolved software and services over the years. It shouldn't ever cost hundreds of thousands to run basically what amounts to "project management" software.‚Ä®‚Ä®There's sin infamous guy that proved this once where he ran something that scaled to stupid amounts of scale on a few bucks a month. I forget what the site/service was though... Anyone? ü§î
2023-01-16T22:49:29Z	(#47clcnq) And... As y'all know, I'm a big promoter of Self Hosted software, services and running shit‚Ñ¢ on your own infra üòÖ
2023-01-16T23:00:49Z	(#47clcnq) So... Just out of curiosity (again), back of paper napkin math. Based on [Vultr pricing](https://www.vultr.com/pricing/), running my infra in the "Cloud"‚Ñ¢ would cost me upwards of $1300 per month. That's about ~10x more than my current power bill for my entire household üòÖ (10 VMs of around ~4 vCPUS and 4-6GB of RAM each + 10TB of storage on the NAS)
2023-01-16T23:07:31Z	(#xxa3lma) @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> I think "platform" in our industry is often taken to be some centralised service. I think that's why I prefer to call what we're building together an ecosystem üòÖ I dunno ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I could be wrong!

We as humans, NEED hope. Thats why religions, organizations, volunteers, exist.‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm sorry but I don't agree with this statement. "Hope", whilst a powerful and useful human emotion doesn't solve anything. We cannot "hope" that the assholes of the world will stop being selfish little (and big?) assholes with power and wealth, or "hope" that Google‚Ñ¢, Microsoft‚Ñ¢ and even Apple‚Ñ¢ will suddenly start giving a shit about user/data privacy and security and stop profiting off data that isn't theirs to have.‚Ä®‚Ä®Anyway...

Too many people are thinking (abd believing) that's a wonderful magical "silver bullet" that will solve all the world's problems (wrong). The hype probably exists (mostly?) because there's going to be a lot of "products" and "services" built on this *GPT (shit) and we're either going to be a) forced to use it or b) ripped off in some way.‚Ä®‚Ä®That's the nature of a capitalist world economy (one which IMO has become quite a hockey stick as we call it, extreme).

I mean there's an in-memory cache, that is synced to disk periodically (and on shutdown), but the cache is really ephemeral anyway, it is populated by fetching feeds. Then there's the on-disk archive, which really shouldn't suffer any data loss, as it's only ever written once.

There is a [Release](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/app/milestone/6) milestone that covers what needs to be done. I'm anticipating this to take around 1-2 months at a cost of around ~$800-~$~1600 USD.‚Ä®‚Ä®My second goal, once this is complete is to get the [Salty.im](https://salty.im) mobile app _actually_ off the ground and at a bare minimum it should sport features that let you chat with individuals, group chats and push notifications. @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> has been hard at work working on Double Ratcheting support (_more secure!_) whilst I've been working on the Broker and API and Blob storage.

2023-01-28T00:55:46Z	(#4jk6bba) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> Yeah to be honest I'm a bit confused by the OP's question here really (sorry @<nwu1dm https://twtxt.net/user/nwu1dm/twtxt.txt>) -- hence why I'm asking what the "use-case" is... -- In case it's not clear, @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> is 100% correct, Twtxt and also Yarn.social (which uses Twtxt and some Extensions) are arguably (IMO) the only truly decentralised social ecosystem that I know of in existence today (bay maybe a few other obscure ones, do we count finger?! üòÖ)
2023-01-28T00:56:44Z	(#4jk6bba) Even as a user on my multi-user pod (twtxt.net) you are free to do what you want, and even host your feed in multiple places just as @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> does, and I believe takes advantage of the `yarnc sync` tool and api üëå

2023-01-28T06:58:15Z	(#4jk6bba) @<nwu1dm https://twtxt.net/user/nwu1dm/twtxt.txt> I _think_ we're talking about different things. If by "disaster" you mean reading your `twtxt.txt` (feed) file, then yes, you need to have a "decent" client. There are a few around, not just `yarnd`.‚Ä®‚Ä®That being said, you can and are free to create your own client however you wish. `jenny` for example (which you can find on the landing page at https://yarn.social) treats every Twt as an Email. And then you can use something like `mutt` to navigate your feeds you follow, replies and your "timeline".‚Ä®‚Ä®Does this make sense? -- I _actually_ thought you were referring to some scalability problem, but I don't think you were, you were talking about the UX? Today the best clients that exist are the ones that are listed on [Yarn.social](https://yarn.social). If someone comes up with another client that's just as compelling (good), we'll be sure to list it there ! üëå
2023-01-28T08:34:18Z	(#4jk6bba) @<nwu1dm https://twtxt.net/user/nwu1dm/twtxt.txt> In order for you to find others to follow and they to follow you, I'd recommend using the [search.twtxt.net](https://search.twtxt.net) search engine. As you've already found your way to my pod (a multi-user client with a Web App, API and Mobile App) you're already being followed by a few in the small but growing community üòÖ -- Find folks is well hard in a true "decentralised" ecosystem. But we're here üòÖ The best way to build your "network" is by interesting with others, you will find over time your network of followers will grow and change over time and what you follow will also üëå‚Ä®‚Ä®[feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net) is also a good course of "external feeds" (many of which are 1-way mirrors of Mastodon users or RSS feeds of websites, news, etc).
2023-01-28T08:44:33Z	(#4jk6bba) @<nwu1dm https://twtxt.net/user/nwu1dm/twtxt.txt> Also if you chose to host your own feed (you're welcome to keep using my pod, it's there for use by all!), one thing to keep in mind as you either pick a client, figure out how to host your feed, etc is the HTTP User-Agent header that many clients will use to tell you they have fetched your feed. This is an important discovery aspect of Twtxt and we extended this as well to support multi-user pods like `yarnd`.‚Ä®‚Ä®See: https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/useragentextension.html‚Ä®‚Ä®At a bare minimum, you basically need to parse your web server access logs. There is a tool that @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> wrote called [useragent](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/useragent) that helps with this.

2023-01-29T04:24:19Z	(#ub2bbia) @<johano https://twtxt.net/user/johano/twtxt.txt> Yeah one of the things I'm trying to do this year is _actually_ properly rebrand and release the app to the App and Play stores.

2023-01-29T04:27:51Z	(#6f7ydta) @<johano https://twtxt.net/user/johano/twtxt.txt> The fact I see this here _probably_ means you did and it worked üòÖ It's a two-way sync, and you can also pass the `-d/--delete` option in case you want to delete something out of your feed and sync those deletions too üëå
2023-01-29T04:30:09Z	(#6f7ydta) Ooops how did this happen:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®# nick              = johano nick              = johano‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®That probably just wants to be `# nick = johano` üòÖ
2023-01-29T04:33:29Z	(#6f7ydta) And by changing the 1st `# url = ` field you've changed the "Hashing URI" of your feed. Things will get weird when syncing back to your `twtxt.net` feed, and I mean really weird. I would recommend the following setup:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®# url               = https://twtxt.net/user/johano/twtxt.txt‚Ä®# url               = https://gem.chiajlingvoj.ynh.fr/twtxt.txt‚Ä®# url               = gemini://gem.chiajlingvoj.ynh.fr/twtxt.txt‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®especially if you want to be able to take advantage of your feed here and use the mobile app, etc. This is something we're working on, but for hit it _has_ to be this way or hashes/threads get a bit weird üòÖ
2023-01-29T04:34:11Z	(#6f7ydta) @<johano https://twtxt.net/user/johano/twtxt.txt> make sense? ü§î
2023-01-29T04:34:59Z	(#6f7ydta) @<johano https://twtxt.net/user/johano/twtxt.txt> Things are being duplicated because you're changing the "Hashing URI". See https://twtxt.net/twt/tv3piaq
2023-01-29T05:13:47Z	(#6f7ydta) @<johano https://twtxt.net/user/johano/twtxt.txt> I _believe_ you will need to pass the `-d/--delete` option now. If that doesn't work, I'll blow away this pod's cache and let it repopulate the cache.

2023-01-30T10:49:08Z	(#dhhickq) @<eldersnake https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> Several reasons:‚Ä®‚Ä®- It's another language to learn (SQL)‚Ä®- It adds another dependency to your system‚Ä®- It's another failure mode (database blows up, scheme changes, indexs, etc)‚Ä®- It increases security problems (now you have to worry about being SQL-safe)‚Ä®‚Ä®And most of all, in my experience, it doesn't _actually_ solve any problems that a good key/value store can solve with good indexes and good data structures. I'm just no longer a fan, I used to use MySQL, SQLite, etc back in the day, these days, nope I wouldn't even go anywhere near a database (for my own projects) if I can help it -- It's just another thing that can fail, another operational overhead.
2023-01-30T15:06:46Z	(#6f7ydta) @<johano https://twtxt.net/user/johano/twtxt.txt> Let me verify something on a local dev pod an get ack to you?
2023-01-30T15:10:01Z	(#nt2b6la) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Yeah so if we also include mobile phone in that category, then I guess I haven't used the "telephone" system in some decades now actually. One thing that happened in Australia when NBN was deployed was people lost their "landline" (_the old telephone POTS system_) and it got replaced with a VOIP system (digital) -- I just always refused as I could run VOIP myself anyway, so I didn't see the point üòÖ
2023-01-30T15:12:35Z	(#4a2eiea) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> I'd like the pod to automatically nuke inactive accounts/feeds. Are you open to that? I _think_ internally there is enough data to go on (whether the user updated their avatar, whether the user updated their description, whether the user actually posted anything at all, etc) if you've seen a "Candidates for deletion" email, those cores are based on nthis. Anything above a 2000 are "sfe to nuke" in my experience.

We can verify email addresses without ever storing it, like we do now. Just send the email, wait for the "token link" to be opened/verified, then activated account.

2023-01-31T03:38:26Z	(#ubd4zpa) For me personally I find it far easier to reason about the data I'm dealing with, what forms it needs to take and what to do with it.
2023-01-31T03:40:55Z	(#ubd4zpa) a large part of this comes from experience, dealing with databases, and SQL many times in the past, and then eventually coming to the realizing that everything is basically key value, stores, bloom filters, trees*, tries and various types of indexes and caches.

2023-01-31T04:21:18Z	(#c3pmcpa) Anyway, even if I did, which I'm sure I did, it wasn't intention to say  that I hate all SQL database outright, but rather my inner rage in this case comes from developers far too often reaching for that shiny *SQL database (doesn't really matter what it is), only to discover when you go looking under the covers at the source code and what data is being stored, accessed and manipulated, it _could_. have been done with a simple embedded KV store or even a SQLite database.

2023-01-31T14:22:05Z	(#jtwsmaa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> This is quite hard to do really. Because the "web app" is a server-side rendered (SSR) app. Mobiles Apps are not normally written this way (in fact they never are). They are two very different code-bases, which is why we spend a lot of effort on the client and the API. On a side note, I'm also working in parallel on a way to "embed" Go code (as a client) in a Flutter App in the hopes for more reusability for Salty.im -- If we can pull that off, it'll also help improve the reuseability of client features and improve on keeping things DRY for the Yarn.social app üëå

But there are hints on events that can be used so that your client software (or you, manually) knows how to connect to the other person's relay and interact with them. > There are other ideas on how to solve this too in the future but we can't ever promise perfect reachability, no protocol can.‚Ä®‚Ä®I guess we (Yarn.social) do much better here in terms of reachability. In fact we do way better in terms of discoverability too.

2023-02-04T14:26:22Z	(#bfbchba) Also it's a push model from client -> relay and a pull model from relay->client (although I guess clients are expected to remain connected to relays via websockets for periods of time)
2023-02-04T14:27:28Z	(#bfbchba) Also the idea of having to publish your posts to multiple relays just to avoid getting your content banned, censored or otherwise is well umm hmmm

But...‚Ä®‚Ä®Let's use the word "making fun of":‚Ä®‚Ä®"Make fun of" an individual **can** cause emotional harm. At worse it can cause bodily harm in terms of suicide or psychological harm in terms of depressions. Humor can be both a tool for good as well as a weapon for bad.‚Ä®‚Ä®The same applies to groups of people, no matter their circumstances, beliefs, etc.‚Ä®‚Ä®In California for example I discovered that even "making fun of myself" (being blind) was even considered **illegal** so I had to be careful about my own sense of humor when stupid shit would happen to me because of my lack of good eyesight.‚Ä®‚Ä®Its important to understand and have empathy towards others, that they may not find the same things you do as "funny", but sometimes quite offensive or even hurtful.
2023-02-04T23:46:07Z	(#kthy2ya) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> Hopefully we've changed subject here a little üòÖ‚Ä®‚Ä®> What I have a problem with, is circulating blocklists, including many instances, because of some political ideology or offensive/dark sense of humor - or worst case scenario, the actions of only few of its members.‚Ä®‚Ä®I too don't want to go down a path of what I call "over moderation"? When we had our first instance of extreme conspiracy content (that started on my pod), we felt the need to do something about this. Not because of the content per se, but because the person found a way to "prop" themselves and their views up above others (potentially) and that is one of Yarn.social's goals. To make abusing the ecosystem **quite hard**. So we built "shadow banning" for this very reason.‚Ä®‚Ä®It is my great hope that as Yarn.social continues to grow (albeit slowly) that certain design decisions like (not using an external scalable SQL database, ephemeral visibility of Twts and Yarns, powerful tools for users and operators), will keep pods small.

Would you mind if I track a couple of key metrics, namely `dau` and `mau` from your pod? ü§î -- That is "daily active users" and "monthly active users". üôè
2023-02-05T01:50:15Z	(#uauwsgq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> It absolutely is ü§£ Something I'm always conscious about myself... One of the reasons I use emojis a lot actually, to clarify my "tone" üòÖ -- I'm just conscious of the fact that Yarn.social (for better or for worse) has already and is already quite global and spans many countries and cultures and folks of all backgrounds and age groups. As much as possible, I agree with you, let's continue to grow a positive culture in the ecosystem of Yarners and Twtxters as much as we possibly can üëå
2023-02-05T02:06:33Z	(#kthy2ya) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Don't we have enough tools that allow users of single-user and multi-user pods to block stuff they don't want to see? ü§î The list includes:‚Ä®‚Ä®- Unfollow a feed‚Ä®- Mute a feed‚Ä®- Mute a twt‚Ä®- Mute a yarn
2023-02-05T02:52:30Z	(#k5dgh7q) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> As discussed on IRC, I _think_ what you _really_ want is per-User level filters. The question is what? Keyword/Pattern based? Language? Anything more? ü§î I consider "Muting" and "Filters" to be somewhat different I guess... If I had to define it:‚Ä®‚Ä®- Filtering is content based‚Ä®- Muting is source based (feed, twt or yarn)
2023-02-05T02:56:02Z	(#k5dgh7q) And if I were to build this, I would simply extend the [User.Filter()](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/src/commit/590ce93f74ce201af5e2f6d28129957b075bdf8a/internal/models.go#L579-L598) function such that:‚Ä®‚Ä®- Source based filters (mute) is the first path‚Ä®‚Ä®Followed by:‚Ä®‚Ä®- Content-based filters (keyword, language, etc)‚Ä®‚Ä®And of course we'd have to build a fancy UI around this üòÖ
2023-02-05T03:00:41Z	(#k5dgh7q) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> probably no more expensive than keyword based filtering to be honest. Right now it's O(n) complexity. It would probably be worth caching "filtered per-user views" (including the timeline) some of which we don't do right now. It would probably save a few % points of cpu utilisation of a larger pod.

2023-02-05T21:48:54Z	(#piq7b7a) @<kaniyama_t https://yarn.takuma-csirt.com/user/kaniyama_t/twtxt.txt> So, if you want to have a more "private" pod, I _think_ the best way to do this right now is:‚Ä®‚Ä®- Block all feeds (Settings -> Poderator Settings -> Blocked Feeds) and used `.*` as the only pattern / regular expression.‚Ä®- Show  "Local Only" posts for Discover (Settings -> Poderator Settings)‚Ä®‚Ä®See example screenshot here: ![](https://twtxt.net/media/hNSPDtRHnHrTdy8sHzfzVo.png)
2023-02-05T21:50:42Z	(#piq7b7a) You are right, you can't really block access to the `twtxt.txt` (feed) itself, that's kind of how it works. But you can basically just create an "isolated" pod if that makes sense? -- You __could_ also put a reverse proxy in front of your pod with a password.

You _have_ to preserve the `# url` field in your feed as we sort-of use this as a kind of pseudo identity if you will. It's not great, but it has been working so far. As long as you leave the `# url = ` as your twtxt.net feed, you are pretty much free to do whatever you want with the feed, host it in multiple places, sync it, edit it, delete stuff, whatever. The whole point is, even if you do choose to continue to use my pod, you are not subject to it existing, or any silly rules I may or may not (will not) impose. Just don't be an asshole ü§£ Simple!

2023-02-10T07:47:36Z	(#mwhjn4a) @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> Yes but think about it... (not that I'm defending Google‚Ñ¢ here), if you were to implement this yourself, you would have to separate out the "fetching a package" vs. "verifying the integrity of a package" right? -- Put another way, you wouldn't trust the checksum/integrity of a package from the source you got the package from (in this case Git) would you? The only wati you _could_ do this is if the checksum was also signed with a key. Even as I write this, I'm not even sure if the GOSUMDB mechanisms can be trusted at all either, as it assumes the "checksums" haven't been tampered with by Google‚Ñ¢ themselves, meaning that in a supply-chain-attack, you have to **trust** Google‚Ñ¢ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2023-02-10T10:06:43Z	(#tk673aq) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> I _think_ in this case, the "spying" is more problematic because it is proposed to be deeply embedded in the Go toolchain üò¢ We're not talking about measuring high-level "counts" here, but being embedded deep within `go ...` commands.

2023-02-10T10:07:59Z	(#yyzjgea) @<eldersnake https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> Yeah I've often thought about this a lot, I I think it's quite hard to come up with a "posts per minute" threshold value that `yarnd` would limits to (assuming we dif at all).

2023-02-11T22:17:26Z	(#qn2pcqq) The `/metrics` endpoint is there for the operator, so you can monitor/measure your pod's performance and adjust accordingly, or file bug reports for me to fix broken shit‚Ñ¢ ü§£ -- It is never pushed anywhere, only pulled.

2023-02-14T13:42:10Z	(#gz5euha) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> You are right of course. I don't think we can consider anything thus are to be remotely close to "intelligence", it actually frustrates me that we can call these fields "AI", we should call them what they are, "machine learning", they're just fancy algorithms many of which are pretty good at "pattern matching".‚Ä®‚Ä®As for what we define as "intelligence", fucked if I know üòÖ I doubt anyone else can define this either. I tend to believe that until we figure out how to create "something" that can have a sense of self-awareness and self-growth and a way to expand and "reprogram" itself, we'll never get very far. Really "evolutionary life" simulations or "artificial life simulations" are much closer I think.
2023-02-14T14:25:59Z	(#gz5euha) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> True and good points, my only gripe though we should call it what it _really_ is üòÖ
2023-02-14T14:48:46Z	(#gz5euha) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Oh I don't accept the marketing hype at all. The thing that I always fall back on is the insane amount of power that it takes to runs these fuckings tupid ass models that are nothing more than (okay admittedly a bit fancier than the ones a few decades ago, but mostly based on the same mechanics) "algorithms" that take data in and spit data out. The shocking part for me is comparing the insane power and energy requirements of even the largest "AI" models in the world and comparing that with the energy/power requirements of running (for example) the brain of a rat.
2023-02-14T14:49:18Z	(#gz5euha) Basically what I'm trying to say is this... If it takes multiple Gigawatts of power to run even the "smarter" and "most useful" AI models today, we're fucked.
2023-02-14T14:49:53Z	(#gz5euha) Wake me up when we can run these LLM(s) and similar models on the energy requirements of a Raspberry Pi ü§£
2023-02-14T14:58:14Z	(#juuwkfq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> It's actually one of the aspects of the "family of machine learning" that I find the most intriguing. If you've ever played the game Creates (I haven't, but know a lot about it), it was an amazing piece of work. I'd love to work on something like this one day or see something like it at a much larger scale üëå
2023-02-14T14:59:27Z	(#gz5euha) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> True, there's no argument there will be some "utility' from these LLM(s) -- It will be even more useful when most folks can run them (maybe at a smaller scale) on "edge" computing on modest hardware.
2023-02-14T15:02:26Z	(#etfdl3a) @<dkordic https://twtxt.net/user/dkordic/twtxt.txt> What's "Speed Bump"? Can you link us? I only know of the concrete kind that's designed to slow vehicles (cards) down ü§£

2023-02-14T16:07:23Z	(#d2kha3a) @<dkordic https://twtxt.net/user/dkordic/twtxt.txt> There's a reason for that.

2023-02-16T22:27:07Z	(#el5mh5a) But.... I'm a bit more convinced that it _might_ be possible to create a Twtxt <-> ActivityPub bridge as a separate optional (opt-in) service for Yarn.social users -- Hell I _think_ it might be possible in general for any self-hosted Twtxt users that self-host their own feed (_without `yarnd`_).
2023-02-17T02:48:01Z	(#m7e43rq) @<screem https://yarn.yarnpods.com/user/screem/twtxt.txt>  Haha ü§£
2023-02-17T06:48:04Z	(#el5mh5a) @<stigatle https://twtxt.net/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt>  Do you think it should directly be integrated into `yarnd` or a separate service / binary / project? ü§î Opt-in or Opt-out?
2023-02-17T07:44:48Z	(#el5mh5a) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> The reason I was thinking about a separate binary / project / service is to bring along our Twtxt friends like @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> and @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> and anyone else that self-hosted their Twtxt feed on their own. But this of course has added complexities like spinning up `yanrd` along with whatever this thing will be called configuring the two and connecting them. Fortunately however `yarnd` already does this with the feeds service and defaults to using `feeds.twtxt.net` -- So we would so something similar there too. Further thoughts? ü§î

2023-02-21T16:19:53Z	(#2p5jzrq) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> So let's do both then? Reuse the same captcha we already have, plus add email verification. Which thankfully doesn't violate our design of not storing the email, as we can still just store the has, send a verification link with a short time-to-live token (JWT) and if we don't get the link verified, boom you're out üòÖ

2023-02-22T20:38:20Z	(#bjjgk4a) @<stigatle https://twtxt.net/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt>  Hmmm what da hell?! üò± How does your pod not have the built in support feed? Hmmm ü§î

2023-02-22T21:06:14Z	(#bjjgk4a) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Interesting... I'll see what I can do about this...
2023-02-22T21:34:24Z	(#bjjgk4a) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Yup, because the `activitypub` features wants to build a default pod actor using the builtiin support feed, which doesn't seem to exist on your dev pod ü§£
2023-02-22T21:37:20Z	(#bjjgk4a) At least your production pod has the `support` feed: https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/support/twtxt.txt‚Ä®‚Ä®Hmmm maybe there's just a racey behaviour were on a new dev pod's startup? Hmmm lemme see...

2023-02-22T21:38:53Z	(#bjjgk4a) FWIW the feature will _probably_ work fine on your production pod. That's why its' feature flagged üòÖ Just enable it through the UI and restart üëå
2023-02-22T21:43:03Z	(#bjjgk4a) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> Meanwhile I'll fix the bug of course... But FWIW you cannot run activitypub or webfinger on a dev instance per se, mostly because it needs full DNS lookups, TLS, etc, for things to work properly.

2023-02-28T13:06:23Z	(#7ycjsea) Interesting this about this incident, is that my LinkedIn password _was_ a 14 character long cryotograhpically generated passwords. I suspect LinkedIn has had a data breach ü§î

It not that my password or a session was compromised. My account is under attack. Someone is trying to hack it (albeit badly) by hitting the password reset form and entering my email address. So what the attackers have is a) My LinkedIn account and b) My email address. Or this is a widespread attack to break into accounts and reset passwords? But... How dafuq does this attack work when you have to have access to the email account as well to get the password reset pin?! üò≥

2023-03-05T22:13:05Z	(#eotp4vq) @<manton https://manton.org/activitypub/manton> Huh I guess we (Yarn.social) already do this implicitly because we send Markdown->HTML converted content out to Activity Pub actors.
2023-03-05T22:16:41Z	(#lo32qmq) @<ocdtrekkie https://mastodon.social/users/ocdtrekkie> Hah, hardly, the specs (AP, A2S, HTTPSig, et all) are just a few of the specs at play. WebFinger and HTTPSig are probably the more straightforward ones. It's the fact that Mastodon existed before Activity Pub and then kind of went and did its own thing (somewhat) that makes things hard. Like the fact we have to translate Twts to HTML but a specialised form of it, with Microformats (mf2) embedded for mentions. Not sure if there are other things we should be doing, tags maybe? But that's a problem for another day/weekend üòÖ
2023-03-05T22:18:04Z	I should probably let y'all know, that is, users on my pod (twtxt.net)... You are now visible on Activity Pub / Fediverse too.
2023-03-05T22:21:00Z	@<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> Am I right in thinking that you are using Yarn's Sync API via `yarnc sync` and your twtxt.net feed as well as Goryon (now Yarn.social) mobile app? That is, you keep a local copy of your feed and publish it on your website, take advantage of Yarn.social's features? If so (pretty sure) it would be awesome if maybe you wrote up a new page on the website or something that instructs others how to do this? ü§î

2023-03-06T06:43:24Z	One of the things I'm noticing with the Yarn.social <-> Activity Pub (Mastodon, GotoSocial, Micro.blog and others) is that when activities are received for Notes (the only activity besides Follow we really support); There is no context in the post. From my point of view, I see folks tagging someone in response to something I can't see.‚Ä®‚Ä®We had this problem a while back with Yarn.social pods and we solve it by building a basic peering mechanisms where pods would peer with one another and ask for the root twt to fill in missing context (basically so you don't have to follow the world to see what the reply was in context of).‚Ä®‚Ä® Do we (Yarn.social) have to do the same here for inbound Activity Pub Create+Note activities? Look at the `inReplyTo` and fetch that too? ü§î #Yarn.social #ActivityPub #Mastodon

The data traffic marked in this way by the network operator is then used to create a personal profile, which advertisers and website operators can then access.

2023-03-11T13:29:21Z	üëã Hey y'all yarners ü§ó -- @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> and I have been discussing in our [Weekly Yarn.social call](https://meet.mills.io/call/Yarn.social) (_still ongoing... come join us! üôè_) about the experimental Yarn.social <-> Activity Pub integration/bridge I've been working on... And mostly whether it's even a good idea at al, and if we should continue or not?‚Ä®‚Ä®There are still some [outstanding issues](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/1149) that would need to be improved if we continued this regardless‚Ä®‚Ä®Some thoughts being discussed:‚Ä®‚Ä®- Yarn.social pods are more of a "family", where you invite people into your "home" or "community"‚Ä®- Opening up to the "Fedivise" is potentially "uncontrolled"‚Ä®- Even at a small scale (a tiny dev pod) we see activities from servers never interacted with before‚Ä®- The possibility of abuse (because basically anything can POST things to your Pod now)‚Ä®- Pull vs. Push model polarising models/views which whilst in theory _can_ be made to work, should they?‚Ä®‚Ä®Go! üëè
2023-03-11T13:40:21Z	(#kolstzq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Hmmm really shouldn't be... Hmmm
2023-03-11T13:45:05Z	(#zbsrabq) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> I really like the distinction made here between:‚Ä®‚Ä®> Freedom of speech / Freedom to shout‚Ä®‚Ä®Basically every other social media platform really. All centralised ones like Facebook, Twitter, etc, and push-based ones fall into this category too üëå‚Ä®‚Ä®Where what we have built with Yarn.social / Twtxt is really:‚Ä®‚Ä®> Freedom to listen‚Ä®‚Ä®Where we have full control of what we "pull", or not (Follow/Unfollow). I also like what we were talking about in the call where we describe the interactions as:‚Ä®‚Ä®> I write something down on paper, and post it outside my mailbox/house.‚Ä®> Someone drives by and reads it and is intuiged.‚Ä®> That someone then writes down their own thoughts and replies on their own paper and posted it by their mailbox.‚Ä®> You come along and see it one day, and decide to further erply.‚Ä®‚Ä®In this way Yarn / Twtxt is _much slower_, but that's by design.

2023-03-11T14:34:21Z	(#zbsrabq) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> Well, the reality is that you cannot actually control this too well. Because of the push model of Activity Pub you have to a) trust that the servers you are interacting with are both correct and not malicious and b) have to send `Undo+Follow` activities to actors you no longer want to follow (missing right now)‚Ä®‚Ä®Problem that I've found in practise however is that even for a tiny pod (used for development) I'm seeing interacting with servers I never interacted with (ever).
2023-03-11T14:36:45Z	(#zbsrabq) In other words, choosing to follow an actor does not follow the same model as Yarn/Twtxt does, where we then decide to "fetch" their feed. In fact it's the other way around, you end up telling server X that you're interested in actor Y, and servers X will then "push" stuff back to you. You can see how this can lead to some of the infamous DoS behaviours that can occur in the wild ü§£
2023-03-11T15:40:55Z	(#zbsrabq) > It is optional as well - so if one does not want it - just not turn that feature on.‚Ä®‚Ä®If we decide that the benefits outweigh the risks and accept that differences (even though we'll do our best to bridge the gaps) -- we'll have to make "Enabling" / "Disabling" an **actual** thing. being an experimental feature flag is not enough, feature flags are designed to be short-lived until promoted, or decided against.‚Ä®‚Ä®The question then becomes more along the lines of:‚Ä®‚Ä®- Do we want a toggle for Activity Pub at the Pod level? (I assume yes)‚Ä®- Do we want a toggle for Activity Pub discovery at the User level?
2023-03-11T15:56:05Z	(#kyaokda) Hmmm
2023-03-11T15:56:39Z	(#kyaokda) I'll have a closer look in the morning ü§û

2023-03-12T00:36:17Z	(#hzwqlla) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> What do you mean by "pedantic" exactly?‚Ä®‚Ä®> What would you, as an end user, do if someone stood up a yarn pod full of assholes who all collectively decided to twt at you all day every day?‚Ä®‚Ä®Right now (without Activity Pub) I wouldn't know. It wouldn't hurt me, I don't follow those "assholes", I don't have to. I don't pull their feed(s).‚Ä®‚Ä®However (which is the point ) if I have Activity Pub integrated and turned on, I have no choice now. Those same "assholes" can send me shit all day, every day, and there isn't anything I can do about it. My options then become to administratively block them at the server or OS level. What if I don't have administrative control?
2023-03-12T00:42:49Z	(#ir4qjla) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> Yes its' not just the "User Experience" that has to be considered when adding any new features IMO. As discussed in [this thread](https://twtxt.net/conv/hzwqlla) with @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> there are legitimate concerns because of the "push" model that is Activity Pub.
2023-03-12T00:43:32Z	(#zbsrabq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> This is true actually and you are 100% right

2023-03-12T01:18:46Z	(#dt4rbaq) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> That was the original plan actually, but I started out this way "because it was easier" at the time. But now that I know more about how it works in general, I'm thinking it might be better to revere tract and go back to the drawing board.
2023-03-12T01:20:17Z	(#hzwqlla) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> As an example of the type of problem I'm seeing (even at small scale, and it's only been a few weeks of things working):‚Ä®‚Ä®My pod has been posted this `Create+Note` from an Activity Pub actor that no-one here seems to follow:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®$ bat https://twtxt.net/api/v1/debug/db "Token:$YARND_TOKEN" | jq -r '. | map_values(@base64d) | {Key: .key, Value: .value | fromjson} | .Value.Following | select(. != null) | .[]' | sort -u | grep -i VaporMarxPlus | wc -l‚Ä®0‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®From https://twtxt.net/twt/ffvzynq‚Ä®‚Ä®This is terrible ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don't trust the protocol at this point.
2023-03-12T01:21:19Z	(#hzwqlla) @<ocdtrekkie https://mastodon.social/users/ocdtrekkie> How in your experience (or can you bring in any experts) is this even fucking possible?! ü§î üò≥
2023-03-12T01:22:28Z	(#hzwqlla) The more I continue on this journey, the more I'm finding myself in a position where my original instincts of integrating with a "push"-based social network like Activity Pub was and is a bad idea. You just simply cannot control shit‚Ñ¢ üò±
2023-03-12T02:07:40Z	(#q7fum4q) @<ocdtrekkie https://twtxt.net/user/ocdtrekkie/twtxt.txt> From my pod? Do you follow them? Or did you follow them briefly? ü§î Just trying to understand... I haven't yet implemented `Undo+Follow` (i.e: unfollow) yet... So maybe that _might_ explain it? If you follow/unfollowed? ü§î
2023-03-12T02:12:45Z	üëã To all our Twtxt users and friends (regardless of what client you use, or how you choose to host your feed):‚Ä®‚Ä®Anyone interested in a Twtxt <-> Activity Pub bridge or even a CLI client/tool for interacting with AP actors as Twtxt feeds? ü§î
2023-03-12T02:36:22Z	(#2wuyiea) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> See https://fed.brid.gy/ it would work a lot like this. Ther eare two ways we can do this, either a full-bridge service where you registry your Twtxt feed + forward WKD requests for your domain to the service. AP actors would then follow you at the bridge service (transparent to them really) and you would in turn follow them as regular Twtxt feeds. There'd be the same amount of work doing translations on both sides.‚Ä®‚Ä®The other way to do this (or in addition to) would be to build a Twtxt client (of sort, or maybe a new multi-protocol client) that supports fetching AP actor's outboxes (the only requirement really being that you need to have a defined Actor with an RSA key pair, which is easy to do on a static site)
2023-03-12T04:12:14Z	(#2wuyiea) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> That's right. This was the original plan, to basically build an AP bridging service and integrated that with `yarnd` -- but at the time it was a lot more work/harder to do this as I had no idea what I was doing then ü§£ Now I do, but the effort/work is still a lot either way üòÖ
2023-03-12T04:13:25Z	@<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> I assume you've been following along with some of the conversations around Activity Pub...

2023-03-26T09:52:05Z	(#ck442ka) @<jmjl https://tilde.green/~jmjl/twtxt/twtxt.txt>  Usually it's surfaces in a user's followers list but is only visible to the user obviously.‚Ä®‚Ä®The hard part is easily identifying new followers.
2023-03-26T12:57:27Z	(#ck442ka) @<jmjl https://tilde.green/~jmjl/twtxt/twtxt.txt> As I said, the capability is already there, we just don't surface it very well beyond the "Followers" list and the "Profile" views. See  ![this image](https://twtxt.net/media/JmBndiTdwdDhbLHRoeDKoA.png "this screenshot") -- What would be nice (maybe?) is some kind of in-app "notification".

2023-03-28T22:43:36Z	(#wpmivjq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Thanks for the review! I'll quickly fix this up before the presentation today (midday) üòÖ In terms of conventions and naming however, yes these are _actually_ called "adverbs". An adverb is a noun that describes a verb, usually be putting an "er" on the end of a verb. But thi doesn't always work and sometimes it's hard to do, so that's why `ServeHTTP` instead of `Handle()` for the `Handler` interface. Even though there is the `Handle` and `HandleFunc` function types ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2023-03-28T22:44:19Z	(#wpmivjq) Also the code-blocks not being indented properly is a bug with Hedge Doc's display. When you go into "Slide Mode" it does render properly I _think_ (I hope!)

2023-04-07T03:01:53Z	(#65pchpa) @<shreyan https://mstdn.social/users/shreyan> My design so far would be to build a simple microPub service that you can run alongside your static site (for example built with [zs](https://git.mills.io/prologic/zs) [demo](https://zs.mills.io/)) that takes your post and runs some hooks in receipt. A hook here could take the post, convert it to a Markdown file, Git commit, Git push and rebuild the site.

2023-04-14T22:35:16Z	(#pud4w2q) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> I see. Thanks, read that article and it makes the problem a bit clear, especially on the liability issue. So, it seems EU lawmakers are trying to fix an economical problem by introducing a new set of laws that regulate a large part of the software industry (open source) that has effectively zero revenue?! This seems to be a bit counter intuitive to me, how are open source developers able to deal with liability for something they produce and publish for free?‚Ä®‚Ä®What seems to be at play here is the capability of open source that has enabled great software reuse by large commercial ventures is under threat by lawmakers that don't seem to fully grasp the landscape of open source.‚Ä®‚Ä®The liability of software and products should be with the builders of that product. This is a bit of a tricky situation, because if you're building a skyscraper a it falls down because of faulty concrete pylon footings, who's at fault, who is liable? You or the company that poured the pylons?
2023-04-14T22:37:49Z	(#pud4w2q) The problem and difference though is that open source is produced, published and free at no cost to the consumer. I also find the situation a bit weird from a legal standpoint as I don't understand how the CRA and CLA can possibly override open source licenses that are also legal documents and a contract between the open source author(s) and consumers of that open source software/library/whatever.
2023-04-14T22:39:30Z	(#pud4w2q) Finally, like the Eclipse suggests, if the new proposed EU laws would go ahead, I too as an open source developer would also have to either a) Put up a notice stating that none of my software, libraires, tools can be used within the EU or b) Simply go closed source. -- This would be extremely sad üò¢ and honestly at that point I would question even continuing to be a software developer at all.

2023-04-15T21:29:59Z	(#gasw67a) Yes this is true and I thought of this too in my analogy.‚Ä®‚Ä®The question is to what extent should lowly free time non-paid open source developers be liable vs. say large corporations that commercially benefit and profit from open source and don't contribute a dime back?
2023-04-15T21:37:29Z	(#d3nta6a) I can see companies taking out liability insurance for their software teams that contribute to open source, but a lowly non-paid developer that writes some open source library or software on his own?
2023-04-15T21:43:05Z	(#ooa7tvq) Fair point (although extreme example to show it üòÜ)‚Ä®‚Ä®Key point here: a line has to be drawn.‚Ä®‚Ä®Right now the EU proposed laws don't distinguish between dangerous software and non-dangerous nor free lowly lone non-paid developer vs. commercial company that profits from open source and has no liability despite making millions or billions.
2023-04-15T21:48:07Z	(#kzzrhuq) Also the car was never built and published freely in the open for all to see and study. There was and are large profitable companies behind these dangerous things.

2023-04-15T22:05:12Z	One of the biggest problems I have with the currently proposed EU laws is that there is no distinction being made between "Free, non-Paid, Open Source" vs. "Commercial Software Products built from Open Source".‚Ä®‚Ä®I find the current situation highlights the fact that large corporations build **Paid-for** products and services to consumers and makes Millions or Billions of $ ¬£ ‚Ç¨ often without as much as either a) contributing back to open source or the projects from which they borrow and depend on b) or pay for what they use or support it in any financial way.‚Ä®‚Ä®A large part of the Open Source Model in my view is often confused with "FREE" as in $0, but this is total bullshit. Companies need to understand that reusing a piece of open source software, library or component does not imply it is **FREE** to you. Companies today **DO NOT** vet, understand, review or even remotely contribute (_in many cases_) bug fixes, security fixes, etc, of the component they freely take and use and profit from.
2023-04-15T22:07:55Z	(#ljhu5bq) It is only until **after** that company has a breach, with harm caused to its end-users does the company do anything about it. I'm not really convinced that's happening either, because the current laws scream and cry out "OMG! üò± We need to fix the Open Source supply chain!" by companies that refuse to take any financial liability for freely using other people's hard work that they didn't get paid for.‚Ä®‚Ä®Companies that use open source component freely without paying for them or contributing back **should** absolutely be held liable when things go wrong, **NOT** the open source developers. Why? Because those companies are often exploiting their end-users and often making them pay for something that is largely otherwise free (-some conveniences added on top).

2023-04-16T01:47:09Z	(#4on4bda) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> Yeah it would be possible to have "bridges" just like I _think_ we should have a bridge finally for Twtxt<->ActivityPub. The motivation behind this proposal/idea is to get away from the trolls and hostility of Twtxt. Its of course too late to change what we did in the past (nearly getting on 3 years now), but trying to find ways to deal with this going forward...
2023-04-16T01:49:57Z	(#gjst6xa) Here's an alternative link: https://gist.github.com/prologic/16a88f1ebbd3d13e4cc6352615919b87
2023-04-16T01:53:59Z	(#4on4bda) The problem of course is the position this forces me in to, with all of this "nonsense", means you end up having so many different competing specs and protocols that you end up in exactly the position we're in now with "chat":  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/VHfyzKrTye65e6ec4aSoa6.png) where none of them work with one another and there's no effective bridging, data or identity portability.
2023-04-16T02:00:51Z	(#oyi5iua) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> See, even if we (for example) did something to change the behaviour of `yarnd` such that it:‚Ä®‚Ä®1. produced a `twtxt.txt` feed that stripped `\u2028` so all posts are single-line.‚Ä®2. converted Markdown to "plain text"‚Ä®3. limited posts to 140 characters‚Ä®‚Ä®Would this make few that scream and shout the loudest happier that Yarn is more _properly_ using Twtxt? ü§î Would Yarn _then_ be considered to be using Twtxt as-it-is/was intended? ü§î‚Ä®‚Ä®Of course this would have the side effect of:‚Ä®‚Ä®- Your longer posts would now be truncated and meaningless.‚Ä®- Posting links to images would no longer work.‚Ä®- Threading would no non-existent.‚Ä®‚Ä®And so we're back to square one, where Twtxt as-it-was-is intended is a spec that whilst on its own useful for a very limited number of use-cases it lacks certain features that make microBlogging and interacting with others viable.
2023-04-16T02:02:10Z	(#oyi5iua) Son in theory we _could_ have a `yarn.txt` feed and a stripped-down and limited `twtxt.txt` feed. But I am 98% convinced this wouldn't solve any of the perceived problems, actually I'm 100% certain. Mostly because there are no offered solutions, no actionable feedback, no contributions, just complains and arguments.
2023-04-16T02:06:51Z	(#sh7griq)  Hmmm‚Ä®‚Ä®> Recently (research and documentation begun in 2007) I have had sufficient experience with a variety of different types of trolls on the internet (in communities, email lists, wikis, and news stories) that it seemed useful to document, categorize, classify, and provide methods for dealing with each type, towards the goal of identifying and defeating trolls as quickly as possible in the interest of creating and maintaining PositiveCommunities.‚Ä®‚Ä®May be something good to learn from here ü§îüëå
2023-04-16T02:40:05Z	(#gjst6xa) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> Yup I completely agree. üíØ @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> has significant bug fixes for buckket's original `twtxt` client, including support for multi-lines (`\u2028`), I suppose anyone (even I) could put up a PR that addresses that, it's a trivial 1-line patch.‚Ä®‚Ä®As for your very positively written position and point, absolutely 100% üëå The fact that some folks write cryptic posts to their Twtxt feed (e.g: the feed that posts geospatial coordinates updates and a status of some reading off a device), or some other formats (rare, but do exit), plain text, Markdown or HTML are all attributes of what the author chooses to write. Probably the only form that would be quite hard to cope with _manually_ would be XML/HTML ü§£
2023-04-16T02:41:29Z	(#gjst6xa) But as you say, if you don't find it useful, don't like it, or whatever, simply don't follow it.‚Ä®‚Ä®Also whilst I understand the appeal of `curl url | less` to read a feed, I find this a terrible user experience in the first place, yes it should be possible to use UNIX text manipulation tools for feeds, which is why using Twtxt as the "spec" and "transport" of the content is so ideal. -- Should you read feeds this way primarily? Probably not.

2023-04-18T02:51:01Z	(#eiv2qka) @<shreyan https://twtxt.net/user/shreyan/twtxt.txt>  I am actually seriously considering forking the spec and putting this to the community.‚Ä®‚Ä®One of the motivating reasons to do this (besides to avoid the continued hostility) is we don't share the same goals or visions.‚Ä®‚Ä®Decentralized microBlogging is for all (not just retro enthusiasts and hackers)

2023-04-18T03:14:46Z	(#eiv2qka) @<funbreaker https://twtxt.net/user/funbreaker/twtxt.txt>  The original spec was very lax on specifics and details.

2023-04-18T14:10:11Z	üëã Q: How do we feel about forking the Twtxt spec into what we love and use today in Yarn.social in `yarnd`, `tt`, `jenny`, `twtr` and other clients? ü§î Thinking about (and talking with @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> on IRC) about the possibility of rewriting a completely new spec (no extensions). Proposed name `yarn.txt` or "Yarn". Compatibility would remain with Twtxt in the sense that we wouldn't break anything per se, but we'd divorce ourselves from Twtxt and be free to improve based on the needs of the community and not the ideals of those that don't use, contribute in the first place or fixate on nostalgia (which doesn't really help anyone).

2023-05-04T14:52:03Z	(#l4nwadq) And also can you define what you mean by "right wing". I honestly get so utterly confused over these terms. The only way I know how to clearly delineate political positions on anything is the [Political Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/) which I don't find any of these persons to be "right wing" at all.

2023-05-04T15:14:34Z	(#h7gltfa) Okay, so Dr. Peterson has a problem with the movie "Frozen" because of the he believes it to be "reprehensible propaganda" and that when he did see the film he left feeling a strong sense it was produced for ideological reasons, an anti-sleeping beauty.‚Ä®‚Ä®He then goes on to proclaim that he like the movie Mohan for a different set of reasons.‚Ä®‚Ä®So what's the problem here?

I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytHLkS_e0lo&ab_channel=TheMajorityReportw%2FSamSeder) and comentrary (sadly which was more annoying than helpful). As someone with much experience with sexual abuse, etc, I find his views on this to be umm how shall I put this. Suptid?
2023-05-04T15:46:47Z	(#h7gltfa) For  example, he talks about "shophistied women" and how "having prior positive relationships" with other men (fathers, brothers) are more likely to express their strong "no" stange to pushy men. He might be talking purely from a psychological standpoint at this point, but geez, he really should have just said outright from the start "rape is wrong" (or something) and been a bit more careful with his words.‚Ä®‚Ä®I also don't need "men" to tell me that rape is wrong ffs ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2023-05-04T23:18:45Z	(#h7gltfa) @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt> Yeah, and it looks like (correct me if I'm wrong) his discussions women, sophisticated women and comparisons to property crimes is quite recent. As a clinical psychologist (which is is) I can understand and pick apart what he's saying from a psychological point of view, the problem is its rather provoking and I don't quite agree with it. I think it's easy to take Jordan Peterson out of context here, and maybe we are? -- I feel like he should have chosen his words a bit better here. I'm quite confident that if you asked him directly "do you support rape", or "is rape ok" he would flat out say no. I'm a bit on the fence on this one just because of his background and how complex language can be to convey.

The interactions between myself and a few others over the past few days makes me very sad, sad to the point where I genuinely think that building Yarn.social was a waste of time, because fundamentally it can never promote free speech, free ideas and good discussions.

So tell me... Let's assume for a moment that an answer to a question would be met with so many words you don't know what the answer was at all. Why? Why do this? Is this a stereotype of academics and philosophers? If so, it's not a very straight-forward way of thinking, let alone answering a simple question.‚Ä®‚Ä®> There are people in academia who believe adult men should be able to have sex with children, legally, too‚Ä®‚Ä®That's disgusting.

(Nobody Shares This) | Dr. Thomas Seyfried - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Qd-Iyyek3Y) -- Very interesting new (_relatively new, last ~20 years_) research on the causes of Cancer, preventative measures and treatment. Also highlights that Cancer is not a genetic disorder, but a metabolic disease caused by environmental and dietary factors. Dr. Thomas Seyfried is cited in ~200 peer-reviewed papers, and has several books on the subject.‚Ä®‚Ä®Sadly (however), since the research is relatively new, is only cited on [Wikipedia: Caner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer) a handful of times and there is only one reference (so far) or mention of "refined carbohydrates" under the "Dietary" section:‚Ä®‚Ä®> Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables, fruit, whole grains and fish and an avoidance of processed and red meat (beef, pork, lamb), animal fats, pickled foods and refined carbohydrates.[15][129]

2023-06-03T03:11:32Z	Incurred ~16 dropouts over the last 48hrs with ~5m outage per dropout. So I finally cracked the shits and run up my ISP to figure wtf was going on. ü§î Turns out after a quality test on the line it was showing ~5-6DB average SNR üò± So filed a fault with the infrastructure provider (NBN Co) whose own equipment picked up the 16 dropouts and also found noise 1/2 way up the 450m Copper cable üòÖ
2023-06-03T03:12:17Z	(#7hjvima) This has resulted in an availability of 99.8% for the Mills DC üò¢ Not happy ü§¨
2023-06-03T03:14:00Z	(#7hjvima) Meanwhile have asked my ISP to switch me back over to what NBN call a "Stability Profile" where the DSLAM uses DLM (Dynamic Line Management) to manage the channels and noise and tries its best to keep the signal up. So far this has resulted in a ~10-20Mbps drop in bandwidth (down from ~90Mbps) but so far ü§û an increase in stability and decrease in latency (less noise? better channels?)
2023-06-03T03:16:26Z	(#7hjvima) Interestingly if you dig around, you come across this article:‚Ä®‚Ä®[Mitigating Amateur Radio Interference‚Ä®to VDSL2](https://www.nbnco.com.au/content/dam/nbnco2/documents/nbn-Amateur-Radio-guide-publication.pdf) published by NBN Co, which basically states:‚Ä®‚Ä®> Some of the frequencies used by amateur radio‚Ä®operators coincide with frequencies used by‚Ä®VDSL2 technology, used by nbn to deliver nbn‚Ñ¢‚Ä®Fibre to the Node (FTTN) services.
2023-06-03T03:17:39Z	(#7hjvima) And later on in the document on How vDSL works in Australia:‚Ä®‚Ä®> Prior to the deployment of VDSL2 technology for‚Ä®FTTN, FTTB, and FTTC, the main DSL technology‚Ä®employed in Australia was ADSL / ADSL2+ which‚Ä®used signals up to 2 Megahertz (MHz). To achieve‚Ä®much higher speeds than ADSL, VDSL2 expands‚Ä®the DSL signal spectrum to up 17 MHz, which‚Ä®happens to overlap with many Australian amateur‚Ä®radio signal bands.

2023-06-18T07:28:00Z	(#7ynlnva) The amazing thing I find by everything I ever try that isn't OpenAI's ChatGPT, is that basically it's all pretty useless at small scale. What do I mean by this? Well, in trying a few different models and tools that you _can_ run locally (not connected to any "cloud" service), the results are pretty underwhelming. For example with Tabby connected to VSCode (locally), you get "okay" results for pretty trivial shit. The moment you try to do anything interesting at all, you either get completely garbage code or copyright headers as suggestions.‚Ä®‚Ä®I just don't have time or energy to waste hours of a weekend on basically what amounts to statistical probabilistic models trained on complete garbage that generates or predicts in pretty awful ways.‚Ä®‚Ä®I event spent a few hours today learning about a statistical model used for natural language processing (NLP) called n-gram(s) or ngrams, and ended up with pretty abysmal results. It all depends on the quality of the dataset, and then it can only predict what  it has seen.

Which registry do you drop your feed in to? All of them? Which ones do you use in your client? It's for this reason we decide that writing a search engine is a better approach here where the crawler can discover the decentralised space and network of interactions between feeds on its own.

2023-07-11T15:37:21Z	(#ow64kqq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> We stopped using most "streaming media" services some years ago, they just aren't worth they money ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The only one we use/have is Amazon Prime, only because we also have Prime for deliveries, etc.

2023-07-15T22:27:07Z	So in the wave of all things AI and this roller coaster we're all on, apparently actors, writers and so on are all on strike. I don't recall seeing anything in my feeds about this, so I had to ask a few folk in real life wtf was going on there...‚Ä®‚Ä®Turns out they're all on strike because they fear that AI/ML models will take over their jobs. There are numerous cases where "tech" has already replaced an actor, now it will just get much easier to do.
2023-07-15T22:28:13Z	(#prgk2sq) Of all the jobs under threat by AI/ML, IMO artistic/creative jobs need to be protected at all costs. Why? It's what makes us human and makes things interesting. Without creativity I worry we'll just end up worse off.
2023-07-16T01:07:45Z	I need to fully automate my backup/recovery process. I use [restic](https://restic.net/) as my primary backup/recovery tool and documented a process for [Docker volume backup and restore with restic](https://docs.mills.io/kKXZbkOiTt-yq3rWM35yZA) which I also use to backup Docker local volumes (_unfortuantely requires small amounts of downtime per service_) -- There is also this nice tool called [auto-restic](https://github.com/reddec/auto-restic) which I haven't gotten around to using yet, which I _thinik_ will help with automating.

2023-07-16T01:09:09Z	(#b2fdplq) One of my main problems/blockers I think is that I use my Mac Studio as my primary backup target (_from my NAS and Docker volumes_), then I use Backblaze B2 as my secondary target from there. So my backup process is 2-step with two targets (_a local target and a remote target_). What I really need is another secondary smaller NAS that I can just host the tools on more permanently, hmmm.

And to be specific, I mean where you pay to run containers and only for the resources the container uses. Normally anyone that claims to do "container hosting" essentially just rentes you a VM of some size and runs an OS on it with supporting tools and services that are designed for running containers. Not quite the same thing, becuase the price comes out at well either at VM prices or higher.

This service uses the Docker API as one of its core components and thus relies on the Docker client, namely the `docker` CLI. You don't obviously need to have anything else but the CLI to use it as the containers are running remote form you. The install of the CLi is pretty quick 'n easy on most (_if not all?_) systems.
2023-08-07T13:05:03Z	(#axkd3eq) I also (btw) just put up a quick hacky website for it just now (_dogfodding the service itself of course_):‚Ä®‚Ä®https://cas.run/

2023-08-07T14:35:51Z	(#axkd3eq) Also, just as an aside, your assertion that Docker is too "fat" and too "corporate" is untrue IMO. I've been using Docker for a _very_ long time (since ~0.7 or so) and if you take a closer look:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®root@proxy:~# ls -lah /usr/bin/docker /usr/bin/dockerd‚Ä®-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 35M Jul 21 20:35 /usr/bin/docker‚Ä®-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 96M Jul 21 20:35 /usr/bin/dockerd‚Ä®root@proxy:~#‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®Compared with Podman:‚Ä®‚Ä®```‚Ä®$ ls -lah /opt/homebrew/Cellar/podman/4.6.0/bin/podman-remote‚Ä®-r-xr-xr-x 1 prologic admin 39M Jul 21 06:13 /opt/homebrew/Cellar/podman/4.6.0/bin/podman-remote‚Ä®```‚Ä®‚Ä®As you can see the Docker `docker` client (CLI) and the Podman tool is roughly the same "weight".‚Ä®‚Ä®The difference is that Docker is a Server<->Client with a daemon architecture, whereas Podman runs containers directly, which is why only Linux is supported. Podman is a bit like my [box](https://git.mills.io/prologic/box) project.

2023-08-18T22:52:59Z	(#kdnskpq) > The term decentralization gets thrown around a lot today, often referring to a paradigm shift in Internet technologies that‚Äôs just around the corner. You may have encountered it in a conversation or documentation about something weedy and technical like a blockchain technology or a federated social network.
2023-08-18T22:58:13Z	(#2a3pssq) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> `yarnd` is centralised if you run a large instance with a large number of users.The design of the software itself discourages an operator from doing this, the more users you have, the more resources the pod would consume. It was never designed for this.‚Ä®‚Ä®`yarnd` is however strictly decentralised, with _some_ distributed features that allow "peering pods" to talk to each other, often exchanging "missing Twts" among peers. This is useful to correct chains or fill in missing roots -- Because the whole "network" is decentralised. This is one of the downsides of a decentralised system, so we had to figure out a "middle ground".

2023-09-02T06:30:32Z	(#pnswdva) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I don't think you and I are on the same page at all here, let alone the same planet. Here's the thing (_and I've said this before_), if I can't stand up your piece of software or service in ~5m or less, you've lost me. If it requires 2 dozen steps just to get going, I'm out. I literally do not have time for this kind of "by hand" building, configuring, reading docs, and the likes. Time is not something I have a lot of.

2023-10-02T06:39:03Z	(#qusduaq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I _think_ I misunderstood some aspects of Wireguard as mentioned [here](https://twtxt.net/twt/xecv6wq), not 100% sure, but so far things are much happier now with assigning `/32`(s) as Tunnel IP(s) for Peers and being a bit more thoughtful about the `AllowedIPs` ü§û I'm only playing around with 3 devices right now, my core router (RouterOS), an Ubuntu 22.04 VM over at Vultr and my iPhone.

However; I dunno whether I'm just using inferior models like `codellama` or `codellama` (See [Models](https://ollama.ai/library)), or whether I'm expecting far too much out of these "glorified" token prediction machines, but all this seems to be good for is banging out repetitive keystrokes.‚Ä®‚Ä®The darn thing is just so well umm, fucking stupid and just umm clueless?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm not really sure what to think of any of this anymore...

2023-10-27T22:01:18Z	Have a bit of a conundrum I need your thoughts on... I have stuck up early conversations with the developer of a nice little Document database in Go called [clover](https://github.com/ostafen/clover). He has kindly offered to collaborate with me on a v2 rewrite (_or improvements_) to my [Bitcask](https://git.mills.io/prologic/bitcask). He very rightfully points out that the project (Bitcask) would benefit greatly from the community (Github in this case) and potential growth from the exposure there. I retorted with Microsoft's recent blatant theft of millions of open source projects to train their CoPilot models without so much as attributing the works they used to drive what is now a sellable product.‚Ä®‚Ä®What do I do? We're at a bit of a "sticking point" here and I'm not really willing to compromise. Microsoft are basically cheating, stealing assholes and should be sued and the execs who decided it was a good idea to steal content to build their product, thrown in. jail.
2023-10-27T22:08:31Z	(#7bhzgaq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Speaking of GPS stuf... I need to build (_hopefully open sourcing it_) a "Geocoder", is that what we call it? A way to auto-complete an address to a GPS coordinate.
2023-10-27T22:09:19Z	(#7bhzgaq) And before anyone asks me why I need to build this, self hosting, privacy, etc. No I haven't found any good self-hosted solutions either i can just "borrow", so I'll have to build my own ü§£ Thinking of ingesting the data (addresses) into a Bleve database and using that to drive the "search"

2023-10-30T06:52:42Z	(#nszj3ja) Pretty sure its the average/p50 that's lower right? p90/p95 is your end tail. So if most of your latencies are sitting around ~15ms you'd expect your average to be lower, otherwise you'd have a much higher p90/p95 right? ü§î

2023-11-19T05:17:27Z	(#zbncbhq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> I don't like languages like Ruby, Java, C# or other similar languages for several reasons:‚Ä®‚Ä®- The number of things you have to know and hold in your head (_conceptual things about the language, types, patterns, esoteric shit‚Ñ¢, etc_) is too high.‚Ä®- These types of languages make it very difficult to "read" and "understand" the code well. Remember Rob Pike's infamous quote "languages are more often read than written".‚Ä®- These types of languages (_due to the way they chose to implement/design their module/import systems_) make it near impossible to know what's being used where.
2023-11-19T05:18:45Z	(#oe3howa) @<eapl.me https://eapl.me/twtxt.txt> It is already possible to indicate your "WebMention Endpoint" via your `text/plain` `twtxt.txx` feed file. All you have to do is emit a `Link:` HTTP header as part of the response. Any standard web server can do this easily, or `yarnd` does it natively.
2023-11-19T05:19:21Z	(#oe3howa) The problem though is that despite the fact `yarnd` fully support WebMention(s) -- It is hardly ever used. I have stats/numbers on its use and it's basically near zero. WebSub (_between pods_) is far more used.

It's a lot harder to SPAM someone with Webmention(s) really because the way it works require you to essentially SPAM yourself, as it required verification of the "source" mention before the target (recipient) accepts it in the first place.‚Ä®‚Ä®`yarnd` fully support WebMention(s) -- What it does not (yet) support is automatically creating "ghost users" for the source user of a webmention.
2023-11-20T06:27:26Z	(#plb77ba) For non-`yarnd` users, it _could_ potentially be interesting to have a "Webmention" -> "Email" forwarding service, such that you hide your Email address behind this service, but have all of the advantages of getting notified if someone happened to mention your web page or twtxt feed or specific twt.

2023-11-23T22:44:15Z	(#3x6bsna) @<darch https://twtxt.net/user/darch/twtxt.txt>  It should work with any endpoint but there's a condition around whether it fires a WebMention or not
2023-11-24T22:08:51Z	(#3x6bsna) The reason this is not working, is there is no `Link` header on your feed that you're mentiong: https://gist.mills.io/prologic/fc5290f62c07494590a7e4bc2804c126
2023-11-24T22:09:27Z	(#3x6bsna) If you have a look at any of the feeds on my pod, they all respond with a `Link:` header in the response.
2023-11-24T22:22:58Z	(#3x6bsna) I can see that your web page https://darch.dk/social has a `<link rel="webmention" href="https://webmention.io/darch.dk/webmention">` in the page's`<head>` which his good. But that is not what you're linking to in your post, so that won't get sent a WebMention
2023-11-24T22:23:32Z	(#3x6bsna) If you mention @<this http://darch.dk/social/> it _might_ work, bit weird though üòÖ

2023-11-25T12:32:35Z	(#3x6bsna) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> I needn an example of where this breaks down I think. Do you happen to have one? ü§î By all rights, looking at the code paths, the issue raised really doesn't make sense to me. The Source is the Twt permalink on the source pod that contains an `@-mention` of the target's Twtxt feed. So that should validate just fine hmm ü§î
2023-11-25T13:30:13Z	See, even a video I was just watching on Youtube just now, the guy said:‚Ä®‚Ä®> THanks for Surf Shark for sponsoring this video, it keeps the content free.‚Ä®‚Ä®So that basically tells me that Google‚Ñ¢ advertising on Youtube‚Ñ¢ is utter bullshit. I have a funny feeling they're (Google‚Ñ¢'s) crack-down on ad-blocker is just an internal reaction to a losing battle with their ad revenue streams in the declins from their ad business.‚Ä®‚Ä®----‚Ä®‚Ä®As an aside @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> and I were yarning about this before... The reason this form of advertising works so well is "brand awareness". There's some interesting content, and you don't mind that the guy or gal is sponsored by some company and they happen to make mention of it and even go into a special part of their video (_without being annoying about it_). You don't even fast forward or anything because you already like their voice, and they're not being completely obnoxious about what they're promoting, and what they're promoting isn't complete garbage, malware or worse.
2023-11-25T13:30:47Z	(#hdcu37a) I'm willing to get that Google‚Ñ¢ is losing ad revenue from sponsored advertising and sponsors of Youtubers.
2023-11-25T14:30:34Z	(#3x6bsna) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> But this is what I'm confused about. Why would my Twt contains a reference to `http://darch.dk/social` instead of `http://darch.dk/twtxt.txt` -- which the later is what I `@-mentioned`? ü§î

NBN installer came out last week to install the NTD and Utility box, after some umming and arring, we figured out the best place to install it. However this mean he wasn't able to look it up to the Fibre in the pit, and required a 2nd team to come up and trench a new trench and conduit and use that to feed Fibre from the pit to the utility box.‚Ä®‚Ä®I rang up my ISP to find out when this 2nd team was booked, only to discover to my horror and the horror of my ISP that this was booked a month out on the 2rd Feb 2024! üò±‚Ä®‚Ä®After a nice small note from my provider to NBN, suddenly I get a phone call and message from an NBN team that do trenching to say it would be done on Saturday (today).

2024-01-26T04:06:18Z	(#hav3dva) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Well, one of the most basic requirements (_this is for a local cafe for some good friends of ours that own/run this cafe_) is placing an order for a coffee and paying. I found [through this reddit article](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/dwcttu/is_it_possible_to_implement_payment_on_static/) that you can use [this service called Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/) which is only HTML+JS that you can embed/use on any website, including (_by the looks_) a static site (_no backend required!_) This is pretty promising already because all the cafe really needs now is a basic (_albeit swank looking_) landing page with an "roder" form.
2024-01-26T06:42:23Z	(#hav3dva) I think [Mobirise](https://mobirise.com/) is still arguably one of the best offline-first, static website builders I've ever tried, I haven't paid for all the fancy extensions/themes it has,  but it is pretty good IMO üëå

I was trying to make a grilled cheese sandwich, but my cat decided it wanted a piece of the action. So there I was, battling my feline friend for control of the pan, when I accidentally dropped the sandwich into the tomato sauce. Well, let me tell you, that tomato-soaked grilled cheese was quite the sensation! My taste buds were dancing with delight as I savored every bite. And my cat? It looked at me with such pure, unadulterated joy, I couldn't help but laugh. So here's to unexpected twists in life and delicious tomato sauce.

I _think_ ü§î Moving feed locations affects the way individual Twts are hashed, as the Twtxt spec never had the concept of an "identity" the location of your feed more-or-less becomes your identity or the first `# url =` field in your feed's metadata.

2024-03-13T10:17:42Z	(#uor3zya) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Here's a summary of my setup:‚Ä®‚Ä®- I maintain a small "Mini DC" comprised of 22RU cabinet 600mm deep.‚Ä®- This houses 3x 1RU Xeon machines + 1 RU 10 3.5" + 4 2.5" NAS + 4RU UPS + 1RU 24-port Gbps Switch/Router + 1RU Tray in the middle + 1RU patch panel at the top.‚Ä®- This is now hooked up to 250/100 Mbps Fibre üòÖ‚Ä®- I run Proxmov VE on the 3x Hypervisor machines. They run a dozen or so Virtual Machines.‚Ä®- I run a couple of Docker Swarm clusters on those machines, running BurmillaOS (a fork of RancherOS).‚Ä®- I just use the local LAN network to SSH into machines, but each physical machine also has an IPMI management interface too for when things go wrong (rarely).‚Ä®- I run so many services I can't being to list them here. But it's in the order of ~50-60 unique services. Some of which you're familiar with as many are public facing, some are internal and others are locked down behind  auth.

2024-03-28T08:18:08Z	(#dyqjn5a) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Well yes, true, but not my primary point. Microsoft really needs to pull their head out of their ass. Toyota, BMW, Samsung and even Apple to some extent. Companies need to understand a basic economic rule: If a customer buys your product X, they really don't expect to have to pay for (useless) service Y in order to use product X. I'm looking at you BMW and Toyota, both have attempted to do this and somewhat failed at a consumer level. I wonder why ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Ä®‚Ä®Now Microsoft?! C'mon. For fuck's sake. If I buy a new "today" computer of some kind. I expect to be able to use it "offline" if I want.

2024-03-28T08:18:23Z	(#dyqjn5a) This whole "data commodity" has gone too far.

A savings account here in Oz barely gets you 0.35%pa to 1.5%pa depending on how much money you have in it (0-$10k, $10-20k, $20-$30k, up to $50k)
2024-04-09T13:48:16Z	(#reqcmca) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> That's precisely what I'm talking about. Investing in good businesses that are well established. If they also produce an income in the form of a distribution or dividend, that that's even better. YOu can have some tax benefits too if you do it right. But the trap? (I think) is falling into this false sense of security of thinking you can leverage up to the bank's LVR (Loan to Value Ratio) only to get caught up. Best to be conservative so you can take the wild swings and obviously diversity.
2024-04-09T22:31:52Z	(#d6xxntq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt>  This is true!

2024-04-13T07:53:10Z	(#lkr7vhq) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Yeah I immediately thought of this when you asked, because we use eBPF-based tools in Kubernetes clusters. It's very powerful stuff and you can do a lot very cheaply with it, including tying packets to processes.
2024-04-13T07:54:14Z	(#6wse6fa) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Well it's screwed with my working hours somewhat, but this year I've decided to just "not give a shit"‚Ñ¢ and just get up at the normal time and start at the time I had been starting work the past 6 months, 8.30am.

2024-04-14T09:01:45Z	(#sa4jlsq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt>  Yea the idea is micro costs to the consumer. No one really does this, that I know of, which is frustrating if you want to run a few small things without the overhead of a whole server or the operational efforts.
2024-04-14T09:14:15Z	(#sa4jlsq) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt>  Based on your previous comment I think I need to reduce the price to a round $0.20

2024-04-22T06:39:29Z	(#4h6nt7a) In my opinion, this _can_ all be solved by a "better standard client".
2024-04-22T06:41:17Z	(#4h6nt7a) In other words, there isn't anything _specifically_ wrong with the Twtxt spec (+extensions), but if you for example use a client and server combination that never considered the `User-Agent` header and check logs or intercept requests for your feed, than you end up missing an important part of the whole flow (unless you are of course deliberating ignoring that, e.g: 1-way feeds, news feeds, etc).

2024-04-28T03:38:24Z	One of the problems I have with changing the way the "Discover" view works whilst at the same time keeping it "clean" (_depending on who you talk to_) is the behaviour between "Timeline" (what you follow explicitly) and "Discover" (a view into the pod's cache). See attached, where I by default prefer a "collapsed" view (_hiding replies_). The default behaviour for Discover (no controls) is "everything".‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/YLGW2zciamariDvgpusCVo.png) ‚Ä®‚Ä®The reason I bring this up is that part of my "workflow" has become to occasionally use the "Discover" view to see if I've missed any "in-between" replies that often happen, find new interesting folks to follow and/or interact with, etc.‚Ä®‚Ä®Changing this to anything but the current behaviour would break this flow for me üò¢
2024-04-28T03:41:33Z	(#j2y47ta) There's also a pod-level setting (admins) that control what the "Discover" (or front page if you're not logged in) display:‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/EyDgXzwpoNSzRpjP4jxNgX.png)‚Ä®‚Ä®This is either:‚Ä®‚Ä®- Local posts only (local to the pod)‚Ä®- All posts in the pod's cache
2024-04-28T03:42:51Z	(#j2y47ta) I'd like to hear some ideas that fix or improve the signal / noise ratio for all users and even benefits non-users (anonymous users just hitting a pod's index page, which is the discover view)
2024-04-28T03:45:09Z	(#j2y47ta) One thing to be clear about here is that it was never my intention for a pod's "front page" (Discover view when not logged in) to be any kind of "listing" or "advertising" or such. That was completely unintentional. If this is expected somehow, we should probably discuss that too more seriously and discuss its merits, and if it can be support, should be supported, or if there's a different solution entirely? For example. there is the [search engine](https://search.twtxt.net) which _could_ show a global feed/timeline view, albeit the domain could be something different.
2024-04-28T03:58:36Z	Hah ü§£ @<dfaria https://twtxt.net/user/dfaria/twtxt.txt> Your @<dfaria.eu https://dfaria.eu/twtxt.txt> feed really does consume about >50% of a "Discover" search with filters "Without replies" and "Hide my posts". ü§£  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/wiso5m2rEAnEhv4sztDvk4.png) `36/2 = 18` at 25 Twts per page, that's about ~72% of the search/view real estate you're taking up! wow ü§© -- I'd be very interested to hear what ideas you have to improve this? Those search filters were created so you could sift through either your own Timeline or the Discover view easily.
2024-04-28T04:01:01Z	(#j2y47ta) Another feature as mentioned in [#iq4rusa](https://twtxt.net/twt/iq4rusa) is using filters on the Timeline and/or Discover views. One of the most common "workflows" I use is to go to "Discover" and use the "Without replies" and "Hide my posts" filters to see if there's anything new and interesting in my pod's cache I haven't seen before or maybe could reply to (or not).‚Ä®‚Ä®Of course as I've locked down registrations on my pod anyway (have kept it locked down now for months) due to SPAM accounts and bots just creating rubbish accounts/feeds, this workflow may no longer be all that useful? hmmm üßê
2024-04-28T04:04:22Z	(#j2y47ta) I'd also be very interested to hear what some other users of `yarnd` have to say, sadly there are only a handful of pods around that I'm aware of and/or that peer with my pod (twtxt.net) üò¢‚Ä®‚Ä® ![](https://twtxt.net/media/7U7zoDpMqDBQmewsJEuiEd.png) ‚Ä®‚Ä®Maybe Yarn.social/Twtxt has become boring or too niche? ü§î Anyway cc @<eldersnake https://yarn.andrewjvpowell.com/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> @<abucci https://anthony.buc.ci/user/abucci/twtxt.txt>

2024-04-28T04:08:33Z	(#j2y47ta) Maybe some kind of option that when enabled will collapse multiple posts from the same feed and only show the top most recent one, with some kind of UI/UX that indicate "N more today..."?

2024-04-29T02:04:37Z	(#xga2gma) That only works if you're a user of said pod right? ü§î Is this going to be the majority of cases or do we have to also worry about anonymous users (and crawlers/bots) where the "Discover" view is essentially the pods front page?
2024-04-29T02:05:51Z	(#iq4rusa) @<aelaraji https://aelaraji.com/twtxt.txt>  Yup! And to be fair to @<dfaria https://twtxt.net/user/dfaria/twtxt.txt> this is a general problem.

2024-04-29T02:11:48Z	(#myuxfkq) I'm not sure what the plans are anymore üò¢ I still love the simplicity of Twtxt too and I've always seen this project as more of an "ecosystem".‚Ä®‚Ä®Appreciate the positive kind words, but you're right, "momentum" has died a lot and I don't have as much spare time or energy as I used to.

2024-04-29T12:40:29Z	(#usfy23q) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> I guess if you're going to support the choice of Bulma (_and the reason for this Yarn in the first place is I'm pretty rubbish when it comes to UI/UX, so I need all the help I can get! ü§£_) -- You need to help me understand; Is Bulma a better choice because you see "components" it has that _may_ be useful in a new (say) Yarn 2.0?

I can think of a few things that people might struggle with: a Domain, Pointing the domain at something valid, Maybe a reverse proxy setup. Running `yarnd` itself is just downloading a binary and configuring it (_which could also be easier_)
