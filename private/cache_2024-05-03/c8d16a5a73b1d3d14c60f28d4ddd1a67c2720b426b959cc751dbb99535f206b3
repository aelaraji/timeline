2024-04-15T02:40:58+01:00	Hello Twtxters!
2024-04-15T02:44:49+01:00	At last! my Twtxt feed is up and running and I can post to it from a remote client! Yey!
2024-04-15T14:35:47+01:00	Good! I guess I'm done setting up my Twtxt. I'll be juggling between the official CLI and Twixter, although I already have a favorite.
2024-04-15T19:37:10+01:00	I'm still figuring out interactions mechanics on Twtxt, for example the at symbol is sufficient to mention someone you follow I guess, like @<twtxt https://buckket.org/twtxt_news.txt> when using the twtwt cli. is that implemented in the twtxt cli as well? it wouldn't heart to try
2024-04-15T19:39:07+01:00	Nope! it didn't work... I still have some digging to do.
2024-04-15T19:42:50+01:00	Oh, nevermind... it did! I've just checked my twtxt.txt file. Now I have to figure out replays ü´§
2024-04-17T23:32:18+01:00	(#3j7ucpa) Oh! thank you @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> and @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> ! I've noticed your replays by chance checking my logs üòä
2024-04-17T23:37:20+01:00	(#3j7ucpa) I wonder if anyone got that as a replay ü•≤ I tried and copied thread's tag from twtxt.net
2024-04-17T23:56:37Z	Testing! Testing! One two FREEE!!
2024-04-18T00:03:05Z	Aaaaand another one?
2024-04-18T00:04:33Z	Ok! third one is the charm... right? right!!?
2024-04-18T00:12:06Z	Hello Jenny!
2024-04-18T00:30:53Z	Test!
2024-04-18T01:52:53Z	Thanks again @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> !! I have figured things out and set up Jenny and Vim completion following your blog post! Cheers!
2024-04-18T12:54:58Z	(#jmbfhca) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> yeah, it seems like it. But I don't mind using neomutt to go through my feed, it feel like a huge upgrade compared to the usual pager üòÑ
2024-04-18T17:05:15Z	(#jmbfhca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Haha! I'm still figuring my way around but Thank you!
2024-04-19T17:40:44Z	Down the rabbit hole we go... *Wee* !!
2024-04-20T02:43:53Z	(#jmbfhca) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Thank you! and sorry, I've just noticed your twt. About the funky characters, it's probably something off with my editor, I've just ssh-ed from mobile and checked my .txt file, it looked like that when I cat the file but normal on neoutt. I'll try and see what's the deal first thing in the morning. (/me wondering if the same thing would happen with this twt)
2024-04-20T02:55:55Z	(#jmbfhca) yep, it did! And it's definitely something with vim.
2024-04-20T03:03:19Z	... or is it vi? ü§î
2024-04-20T20:01:19Z	(#jmbfhca) OK time to put this to the test, I ended up setting my $VISUAL env‚Ä® {-here-} variable, so that jenny can launch neovim instead of plain old vi like‚Ä® {-here-} it is instructed in the code. But as you can see, I still get these‚Ä® {-here-} wired new lines every ~70th character (marked them with {-here-})
2024-04-20T20:09:35Z	Now I'm about to do something that May...be... stupid, I'm no dev but‚Ä®I'll try and replace the U+201 in the script with a space and see what‚Ä®happens ...
2024-04-20T20:17:20Z	(#gtqdgla) lets test this now yadi yadi yada a gray fox jumped from I don't know what over something or someone! ... nope! still does the thing ...
2024-04-20T20:22:34Z	(#gtqdgla) Wait a second! I did get the new line in my editor but the <U+2028>s dissapeared from the twtxt.txt file.  let's add in a new line just to make sure I did not break anything. üòÇüëç
2024-04-20T20:24:26Z	(#gtqdgla) borked it! no new lines for me üòÇüëçüèª
2024-04-20T23:21:35Z	(#nlzhexa) @<shreyan https://twtxt.net/user/shreyan/twtxt.txt> ever tried [KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) or [Pass/Password Store](https://www.passwordstore.org/) ? They are worth giving a try ... Then you can keep your KeepassXD database in synch across your devices with (NOT /R/s/y/n/c) I meant [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) or git in the case Pass (using a git repo in within your local network of course) üëçüèº(edited)
2024-04-21T00:02:08Z	(#gtqdgla) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> it actually does! ‚Ä®‚Ä®But I broke something trying to get rid of the random characters showing on my twts as mentioned here [#k7tcqwq](https://twtxt.net/twt/k7tcqwq).‚Ä®I taught it was as easy as swapping the '\u2028' in jenny's new_twt_from_file function but there's a reason I'm not a developer (yet) üòÖ‚Ä®‚Ä®It kinda got rid of them in a way but broke the new lines in the process. So I put things back the way the were till I figure out something else.
2024-04-21T00:19:12Z	(#lbyemiq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> I'm using both machines in English.‚Ä®‚Ä®Checked my locale and it spits out:‚Ä®‚Ä®LANG=en_US.UTF-8‚Ä®LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"‚Ä®LC_ALL=‚Ä®‚Ä®ü§∑üèΩ ... and that only happens when vi, vim or nvim are launched by Jenny to compose a twt.
2024-04-21T00:51:44Z	(#lbyemiq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Thank‚Ä®you! and here's a twt with the said random characters, since I've been‚Ä®cleaning them up manually, earlier before scp-ing my twtxt.txt file. And‚Ä®maybe a screenshot of how things look in my editor? ![screenshot of neovim](https://aelaraji.com/2024-04-21_01-37-08_931x123.png)‚Ä®‚Ä®Those new lines are added automatically as I type (except for the ones‚Ä®after the screenshot.
2024-04-21T01:38:23Z	(#lbyemiq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> sure! Give me a couple of minutes to set things up.‚Ä®Also, you can check the charset again, I did set it up even tho I do observe the problem in my twtxt.txt file on my local machine way before doing scp to the remote one. They show up when I use bat but not when I cat the file nor on neomut.
2024-04-21T01:45:10Z	(#vokg2fa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> can't say for sure, but I believe it's a JetBrainsMono Nerd Font ... I'm kind of the set it and forget it type. but will try and check later to be sure.
2024-04-21T14:58:04Z	(#nlzhexa) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> You definitely have got a point!‚Ä®‚Ä®It is kind of a hassle to keep things in sync and NOT eff up.‚Ä®It happened to me before but I was lucky enough to have backups elsewhere.‚Ä®But, now I kind of have a workflow to avoid data loss while benefiting from both tools.‚Ä®‚Ä®P.S: my bad, I meant Syncthing earlier on my original replay instead of Rsync. ü´†
2024-04-21T15:03:42Z	(#jmbfhca) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Awesome! glad to hear that!
2024-04-21T15:32:51Z	(#vq5z3tq) I might have found the actual source of my problem.‚Ä®‚Ä®Jenny uses an .eml file when composing a twt ... ‚Ä®and vim kinda auto formats it and inserts in those line breaks every ~70 character.  ‚Ä®‚Ä®Then, I stumbled upon this link where [Where someone reports](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=503271) that saving a .eml into a .txt might... corrupt the data?
2024-04-21T18:36:42Z	(#nlzhexa) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> I can't say for sure. I didn't even know how three-way merges work till I looked it up. I guess it's more of git thing that would prove useful in the case of using passwordstore/pass.‚Ä®As for Keepass, all I do is syncing it's database file across devices using syncting. Never felt the need to try anything else.‚Ä®‚Ä®I guess it is safe enough for my use case, with [Backup database before saving](https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide#_advanced_save_options) on and custom [Backup Path Placeholders](https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide#_backup_path_placeholders) as Backup plan in case of an Eff up.
2024-04-21T20:52:00Z	(#vq5z3tq) ... Or, maybe (most likely) I don't know what I'm talking‚Ä®about.‚Ä®‚Ä®Anyway, let's get ... Twtn'? Twtxting? Tw... /me will shut up! üò∂
2024-04-22T10:04:05Z	(#ypx5nrq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I‚Ä®wonder if there's something I can add to this test feed's metadata to get it unlisted so no‚Ä®one follows it by accident.
2024-04-22T10:07:47Z	Good Morning everyone! Wishing all of you a productive and Happy Monday!
2024-04-23T19:43:42Z	(#2v6ranq) @<jdtron https://tilde.team/~jdtron/twtxt.txt> you'd be surprised!‚Ä®I just did :)
2024-04-23T22:46:40Z	(#2v6ranq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Yeah I know! üòÖ I've checked their blog and mastodon earlier. That's what inspired me to replay to their twt, just in case.
2024-04-24T15:59:02Z	(#z4m2yla) Wishing you a swift recovery @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt>
2024-04-28T01:19:55Z	It's kinda quiet in here today!
2024-04-28T19:51:35Z	(#lqnxaxa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> TBH It was quite late (where I am) when I wrote that twt, way past 2 AM ... üòÖ‚Ä®But there wasn't much activity during the day either. It got me wondering if there was something wrong with my cron task for fetching your feeds.‚Ä®‚Ä®Maybe it's just the weekends. + there isn't much bloat content around this space as on the usual platforms anyway.
2024-04-28T20:00:17Z	(#dlwuhua) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Well, Imagine getting to wake up around that same time, every, single, day. ü•±‚Ä®‚Ä®(It ain't as good of a live as it sounds though.)
2024-04-28T20:48:17Z	(#iq4rusa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It was one of (if not THE) first feed(s) I got to follow after discovering Twtxt and setting up my own.‚Ä®It was quite nice for the first couple of hours, I've even got to explore a couple of @<dfaria.eu https://dfaria.eu/twtxt.txt>'s articles. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Theeeeen... Things started to feel a bit overwhelming I had to "Clean Things Up!". ‚Ä®Flushed my whole Jenny/Mutt cached twtxt feed and re-synced everything all over again.‚Ä®‚Ä®But hey,‚Ä®Good evening! üéßüéµGuns N' Roses - Live and let die.
2024-04-28T20:50:31Z	(#gadf52q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Roger that! ü´°
2024-04-28T21:16:02Z	(#lqnxaxa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Oh, That sounds delicious! B'Saha![1] ‚Ä®I'm Glad you've had quite the productive! All I remember of mine is three chapters of an old novel at the coffee shop aaand ... Now I'm here, in front of a computer. Everything in between is just *Blank* üòÖ‚Ä®‚Ä®[1] B'saha: Moroccan word for "With health!" (a literal translation) usually used as an equivalent for the French expression "Bon App√©tit!" but also used as "Congratulation!"
2024-04-29T02:31:07Z	(#tltyzqq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> It would definitely impress the Moroccan ones. Not sure about the other nationalities, though. üòÖ ‚Ä®‚Ä®(TL;DR: each country/region has it's own dialect)
2024-04-29T02:57:31Z	I have finally decided on creating a proper... (landing page?) home page or whatever it is for my domain name.‚Ä®‚Ä®It has been the same eye soar of a blank white page for years now. ‚Ä®And this, is when I had something I wanted to toy with in the background, ‚Ä®otherwise, which is most of the time, to be precise, It wasn't pointing at anything at all. üòÖ
2024-04-29T03:00:09Z	(#jleb2hq) It will be minimal for the time being. ‚Ä®The bare minimum, just ... Not blank.
2024-04-29T17:50:28Z	(#4b5wi3a) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ‚Ä®I actually love that one! But no. Mine will be a simple header and a‚Ä®sub-header, breaking that ugly void. I might add in a couple of links‚Ä®later but that will be it. Till I make a functional one.
2024-05-01T00:54:48Z	(#u6enjda) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>‚Ä®That's awesome!! Congratulations! üéâüéâ
2024-05-01T13:42:36Z	(#hjcroaa) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> well there is "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"!‚Ä®I usualy hear people ask Harry Mack (a freestyle rapper) to include it in his freestyles. üòÜ
2024-05-01T17:08:32Z	(#ugqa7ra) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> There are a [couple more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_word_in_English)‚Ä®I went and looked them up but I can't imagine myself using any except for  "honorificabilitudinitatibus" ... It kinda sounds good and has a nice meaning I guess.
2024-05-01T17:48:35Z	(#7zepcma) @<dev1ls gemini://texto-plano.xyz/dev1ls/twtxt.txt> First replay to your first twtxt from Spain! (I guess) Welcome back in! üññ
2024-05-01T23:49:35Z	(#7zepcma) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> I've dropped him a message earlier on Mastodon, will let him know if he replays üëå
2024-05-02T01:32:29Z	(#7zepcma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I guess, you don't get to check the logs if you host your feed file on a pubnix ...
2024-05-02T01:57:57Z	(#gpwgxxa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I looked it up, couldn't find a proper course/tutorial. üòÇ
2024-05-02T15:45:16Z	Do you believe one can survive surfing the web using a text-based web browser? (i.e: Lynx or W3m) no CSS no Bling for at least 24 hours üò≤
2024-05-02T16:08:40Z	(#vrckl3a) Decided to give it a try and I'm already starting to feal the pain LOL
2024-05-02T16:19:43Z	(#vrckl3a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Oh! Thank you for the link! I'm checking it right away!‚Ä®I hope I don't get slapped with a "HTTP/1.1 426 Upgrade Required" there as well.‚Ä®‚Ä®As for Netflix and Co. I can do without for the time being.

2024-05-02T16:48:29Z	(#vrckl3a) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> Well trust me if I tell you that most of my past addictions have started with a "Just once" or a "24 hrs challenge".‚Ä®‚Ä®I'm reading through the Week Week In TTY thread you've linked earlier and oh-boy! ‚Ä®People went All In TTY and no X ...

2024-05-02T22:44:08Z	(#ry5fekq) @<dbucklin https://www.davebucklin.com/twtxt.txt> apparently Txtnish isn't maintained anymore. if interested you could give [Jenny](https://www.uninformativ.de/git/jenny/file/README.html) a try.‚Ä®I've never had to look back once I've had it set up with mutt following  @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt> 's [guide](https://www.uninformativ.de/blog/postings/2021-09-19/0/POSTING-en.html)
