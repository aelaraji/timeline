2020-07-04T02:08:35-07:00	My first twtxt. Nobody will follow me, but I'm sure if I shill enough on my website I'll get a few people to read my messages in a browser.
2020-07-04T02:10:37-07:00	I'm not even using a real client, I made a (poorly written) bash script to write messages to a file and exit if it's over 140 characters.
2020-07-04T02:24:26-07:00	Put a nice twtxt section on the root of my website. Fun fact: it isn't automated, so every time I "tweet" I have to manually add it there.
2020-07-04T03:52:12-07:00	Moving to Mexico to start an underground GNU/Linux users group, gonna call it RMS-13
2020-07-04T18:39:38-07:00	https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/issues/527 Domains visited using mobile DDG browser get sent to DDG servers... I'll switch to Firefox.
2020-07-04T23:01:56-07:00	The amount of times I've had to boot my (GNU/Linux) laptop just to ssh into it on my (Windows) desktop to do a basic task is astounding.
2020-07-05T19:19:54-07:00	https://hardware.majix.org/ cool website showing off someone's old computers
2020-07-05T23:52:05-07:00	Reminder that https://mckinley.cc/ is fully Lynx-friendly :)
2020-07-07T01:14:06-07:00	Got my new ThinkPad in the mail today. An X61T. Installed Arch on it, everything went well. May go to Parabola eventually for extra freedom.
2020-07-07T01:18:18-07:00	I would like to make a list of the computers I own on here, have pictures and specs of the machine. Would be a fun project to index them.
2020-07-08T00:08:56-07:00	I finally made a script to add my twtxt messages in the 3 necessary documents. It isn't pretty, but at least it gets the job done.
2020-07-08T00:47:38-07:00	My hosting provider probably won't let me use a public key for authentication with FTP though, so that still needs to be done manually.
2020-07-31T12:52:45-07:00	Man, haven't used this in a while. Not dead. Blog post coming soon:tm:
2020-07-31T14:53:52-07:00	Just added a new page on mckinley.cc with some of the computers I have and their specs. https://mckinley.cc/computers.html
2020-08-01T15:42:18-07:00	The computers page on https://mckinley.cc/ kills Lynx compatibility, and I'm stumped on how to fix it without the looks tanking for everyone
2020-08-04T18:41:06-07:00	Good discussion about bad article on HowToGeek: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/why-i-still-use-an-old-powerpc-mac-in-2020.2248402/
2020-12-10T21:21:30-08:00	Computers page looks like garbage, but at least I've finally gotten around to making it an official part of my site.
2021-01-15T21:42:41-08:00	I was once shown a site with CSS making it look like the source HTML but I didn't save it. If you know it please send a message on Session.
2021-01-15T21:46:07-08:00	The 140 character limit of the twtxt spec is annoying. I hope you got the essence of my previous post.

2021-02-12T01:40:29-08:00	People's minds are blown about how Mojang made worlds deeper in Minecraft. I predicted this exact solution months ago and was called crazy.
2021-02-12T01:45:59-08:00	The 1.17 update to Minecraft will have some interesting features, but I don't really see myself playing a lot of anything newer than 1.12.2.
2021-02-13T22:51:28-08:00	Calls to "own your data" and focus on "privacy" fall on deaf ears if you're sponsored by Google and Mozilla, recommending the use of Tumblr.

2021-02-16T11:15:51-08:00	I've been on an archive.org book waitlist for weeks because I can't find the book anywhere else. It sucks to not illegally download things.

2021-02-24T16:11:42-08:00	MC 1.17: Bedrock in existing chunks won't be replaced with grimstone. Grimstone starts at y=-1, bedrock ended at y=0. Very specific numbers.
2021-02-24T16:20:21-08:00	MC 1.17: I predict there will be a bedrock wall generated on the border of 1.17 chunks that go to y=-64 and pre-1.17 chunks that go to y=0.
2021-02-24T19:33:06-08:00	The AC adapter for my W700ds arrived. I can now say the reviewer who referred to it as "a very brick-like power brick" was absolutely right.
2021-02-25T10:19:59-08:00	Why is it so common for help sites of software projects to have no links back to the main site? I always have to change the URL manually.

2021-04-15T19:25:25-07:00	My 9.5KB plain text feed is also getting up there. I've been thinking about adding a feed with only recent posts. Last 25 or 30, probably.

2021-04-21T23:41:17-07:00	Please stop recommending JavaScript programs to me. They're bad enough in a browser, let alone as a piece of dedicated software.
2021-04-24T23:38:37-07:00	Oh, you've got to be kidding me. I can get xx.xx (domain withheld) for less than I paid for mck.cx! That's one character less!
2021-04-24T23:54:41-07:00	Okay, IN MY DEFENSE: It is rare (and becoming more rare) to find a 2+2 letter domain that you don't have to pay hundreds of dollars for.
2021-04-25T23:21:20-07:00	Almost been 24 hours. I don't have control of my domain. GoDaddy shows it for sale. $5000 instead of $16. Contacting support in the morning.

2022-06-24T12:08:28-07:00	Lab6, the zine about itself, just released Issue 3! It's a PDF/Gemini/HTML/TeX/x86 polyglot this time. Great stuff! https://lab6.com/3
2022-06-25T16:06:07-07:00	Great blog post. I've been thinking about this, just couldn't put it into words. https://seirdy.one/posts/2022/06/25/two-types-of-privacy/

2022-07-20T17:05:42-07:00	TeamViewer installs a suspicious font, apparently only for browser fingerprinting: https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/teamviewer-font-privacy.html
2022-07-21T22:54:52-07:00	A "Submit to HN" button at the bottom of a blog post is a little presumptuous, don't you think?
2022-07-22T00:41:19-07:00	I compiled Ladybird, the Linux port of the SerenityOS browser. Here's a screenshot of my website: https://mckinley.cc/img/ladybird.png
2022-07-23T13:30:14-07:00	I've been TrackPointless for 3 months, and I finally swapped keyboards with my parts T430 this morning. Oh, how I've missed you, old friend.
2022-07-23T13:35:20-07:00	A 5 minute job delayed for 3 months is the McKinley Labs way.
2022-07-30T20:18:05-07:00	I'm currently halfway through my first Gentoo install. Coincidentally, also my first GNU/Linux install on a system with Nvidia graphics...
2022-08-03T16:42:18-07:00	This is, perhaps, the greatest bug report of all time. IRC clients should specify a Gentoo-specific username: https://bugs.gentoo.org/35890
2022-08-03T16:45:12-07:00	I was going to say it was the second greatest, but the Epic Games GitHub Mail Disaster of 2022 was a pull request.
2022-08-11T02:10:19-07:00	RIP Terry Davis. I can't believe it's been 4 years already.

2022-08-29T22:40:45-07:00	Having fun brushing up on Git. I have a remote set up on my web server. This post is the commit to make sure the post-receive hook works.
2022-08-29T22:56:59-07:00	It didn't.
2022-09-01T03:37:04-07:00	A 21 year old bug in Firefox just wasted half an hour of my life.
2022-09-01T16:02:33-07:00	Here's the bug report, it's very entertaining. Tony Marston is my favorite character. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98168
2022-09-08T21:42:26-07:00	Handwritten HTML strikes again! Since June this year, I've been truncating the name of the month to the 1st 3 characters in my twtxt archive
2022-09-08T21:42:36-07:00	I also found some bad markup in the twtxt archive that's been there for over a year. Hopefully that section won't be handwritten for long :)

2022-09-23T14:21:39-07:00	TIL about the non-breaking hyphen: ‑ (U+2011)
2022-09-26T22:24:33-07:00	Added a section to my XSLT stylesheet explaining what Atom is. That was the point of making it, but I got carried away with date conversion.
