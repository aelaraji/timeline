2020-07-28T05:48:02Z	🎉 **NEW:** Feeds created on [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) now have profiles so you can see how many users follow your subFeed! In the process however I nuked all the subFeeds on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) (_real sorry about that!, there's no way to recover them 😢_)
2020-07-29T03:10:19Z	📣 **FYI:** Okay folks. I'm going to update [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) with the following significant bugs/features [#41](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/41) and [#46](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues/46) 🎉 I hope nothing terribly goes wrong with the upgrade! 🤞
2020-07-29T03:54:24Z	🎉 **NEW:** Great news [twtxt.net[(https://twtxt.net) and all you Twters! Inline link rendering on the platform is now more consistent! 🤞Even better news, sessions are now persistent and last longer (_up to 10days_). No more getting logged out frequency! 👌
2020-07-29T12:22:00Z	🎉 **NEW:** Hey all 👋 Just added a "Local Feeds" section to [/feeds](https://twtxt.net/feeds) where you can also discover user created local feeds (_we call them (sub)Feeds here_). Check it out! 🤗
2020-07-31T00:48:37Z	🎉 **NEW:** As of today, You can now upload your own custom Avatar or Profile pic of yourself under [/settings](https://twtxt.net/settings) This hopefully gives you the option to personalise how you are presented to others (_the default is to auto-generate an Avatar on your `Username`_)
2020-07-31T04:19:54Z	🎉 **NEW:** Password Reset now works! If you have forgotten your password and _happened_ to have also entered a valid Email Address when you signed up, hit the "Forgotten Password" link on the [/login](https://twtxt.net/login) page. Thanks!

2020-08-03T13:25:31Z	📣 **SEV**: We  just had a first incident on [twtxt.net](https://twtx.net). A codebase structure caused some internal data structures on disk to be invalid and had to be deleted and re-created. Sorry! 🤗
2020-08-06T02:50:04Z	🎉 **NEW:** Say hello to "Last Delete" and "Last Edit". You _can_ now correct your last Twt! Happy Twt'ing 🤗
2020-08-06T02:55:57Z	📣 **FYI:** We have bumped the "Maximum Length of Twts" from `288` to `576`. Enjoy the new word/character limits! 🤗😎

2020-08-08T06:36:45Z	🎉 **NEW** You may have _noticed_ the new shiny UI/UX here on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) with the new "Toolbar" 😎 This allows you to do basic formatting of you Twt(s), like **Bold**, *Italics* as well as create web link, image links and we even improved how the upload media/image/photo button works! Weee what a Saturday! 🤗 Please enjoy! And if you find any bugs, quirks or weirdness please tag @prlogic or @<support https://twtxt.net/user/support/twtxt.txt> and let us know! 🙇‍♂️  ![](https://twtxt.net/media/ekw95GnfZ8Yhx4BXsbdFTk.png)

2020-08-14T14:00:21Z	📣 **ANN:** This pod is going to be migrated to a different cluster. This will be done as quickly and as painlessly as possible by doing an incremental sync, shutdown, final sync and brought back up again. Hopefully no-one will notice 😀
2020-08-14T14:22:52Z	👍 And done. That went _smoother_ than expected 🎉
2020-08-16T08:47:00Z	🎉 **NEW:** As of `v0.0.12-71-g79202a2` of [prologic/twtxt](https://github.com/prologic/twtxt) _all_ [Twt.social](https://twt.social) pods such as this one ([twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)) now display the date/time of posts in the timezone of your choice. Go to your [/settings](https://twtxt.net/settings) to change your timezone from the default of `UTC` to your local timezone, e.g: `Australia/Brisbane` 🤗
2020-11-07T04:31:48Z	📣 **NEW:** Improved default Avatar and Media resolution to 360px and 720px respectively. You _should_ notice much improved quality if you update your Avatar or upload photos on your next Twt! Happy Twt'ing 🤗
2020-11-08T04:31:01Z	🐞It appears we broke the backend for uploading photos! Our apologies will get this working as soon as possible againB 😥
2020-11-08T06:16:54Z	@<news https://twtxt.net/user/news/twtxt.txt> (#yfsgypa) This is now fixed! #<resolved https://twtxt.net/search?tag=resolved>
2020-11-11T09:29:14Z	📣 **ANN:** Thanks to [@mdom](https://github.com/mdom) we now _own_ / _manage_ the [we-are-twtxt](https://github.com/jointwt/we-are-twtxt) voluntary registry of users and automated feeds (_bots_).
2020-11-13T10:41:07Z	📣 **SEV 1**: Brief ~45m outage this evening due to a fast moving storm that didn't last long. Started: 20:15 Resolved: 2045 (AEST). Apologies for the inconvenience (_haven't the funds yet for a UPS for the current infra backing twtxt.net and most twt.social pods we managed_).
2020-11-14T07:16:48Z	🎉 **NEW:** With the merge of [PR 269](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/pull/269) which closes [Issue 264](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/issues/264), we will no longer store email address at all! But how will you recover your password in case you forget it you say?! 😳 Easy! You just enter the same email address you used when you signed up on the password reset page. If it matches a one-way cryptographic hash of the email you originally used, we'll send a password reset token to that email address, if not whoops!
2020-11-17T08:18:07Z	📣 **SEV1:** There was a 8h15m outage today on [Twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) (_this pod_) where it looks like there was a Goroutine leak. Could be a bug in code, could be anything. Ii is #<resolved https://twtxt.net/search?tag=resolved> now but will be looking into the RCA and report back once I find out what happened and how. Apologies for the inconvenience, I was physically at my work's office so unable to do anything 😀 (_I was also unaware as I don't alarm on Goroutine leaks, I should!_). ⎚
2021-01-16T23:26:05Z	📣 **NEW:** The "Twt Blog" feature here on [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) (_and others pods, if updated_, cc @xuu @etux) now support rendering Twtxt URI(s) and Hashtag(s). You can mention a local pod user with `@johndoe` or a remote pod user with `@johndoe@domain.tld`. You can even mention traditional Twtxt users with the regular @`<nick url>` syntax and #`hashtag` are also fully supported (_which link to your local pod_). Happy Twt Blogging! 🤗
2021-01-26T01:23:06Z	📣 **ATT:** For those of you that use the Mobile App [Goryon](https://jointwt.org/goryon/) and are active users of my pod [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net), you **will** need to Logout and log back in again. Why? Because a recent update meant that a change to the API Signing Key was required for the JWT tokens used by API clients. Thank you! 🙇‍♂️
2021-02-06T02:17:53Z	📣 **FYI:** The bug that was causing unwanted duplicated `FOLLOW` events, especially of the @<news https://twtxt.net/user/news/twtxt.txt> bot has now been fixed. It was just silly stupid background jobs running every hour 😳 cc @jlj and @<thewismit https://twtxt.net/user/thewismit/twtxt.txt> (_you might want to upgrade!_)
2021-02-06T03:06:04Z	Test

2021-02-19T18:53:20Z	📣 **FYI:** Sorry about that folks. Bit of a bug/issue with a recent change that made the pod get stuck on startup. I've reverted the commit for the time being while we work out what the bug is. Thanks! 🤗
2021-03-02T12:25:23Z	📣 **SEV 1:** Apologies to all that actively use my pod [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) 😢 -- Had a pretty nasty storm ⛈ here tonight down under so I had to power down. Unfortunately the high winds and rain took out my power circuit for a while 😳 I'll see if I can do something about this before next year's storm reason. Apologies for the inconvenience!
2021-03-30T11:43:18Z	📣 **ANN:** Fixed a bug in multi-line messages. cc @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt>
2021-04-08T23:22:05Z	🎉 **NEW**: Thanks to @<readfog https://twtxt.net/user/readfog/twtxt.txt> as of last night, Yarn/Twt social pods (_sorry we're still in the process of rebranding_) now support localization and we have our first (_mostly complete_) translation into Chinese (`zh-cn`)! 🙇‍♂️ This is awesome!
2021-07-04T05:58:58Z	📣 **FYI:** Just letting Yarn.social Pod owners now that there were some bugs with the data migration of Email(s) -> Recovery Hashes used to request a password reset via email. If you are a Pod Owner, please update your software instance (_there is a new "Reset User" feature in the Pod Management -> Manage Users_).   If you are a user affected by this, can't login, can't reset your password, then please contact your Pod Admin. Thank you! 🙇‍♂️

2021-11-05T14:15:03Z	📣 **NEW:** [Releases - yarn - v0.6.0](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases/tag/0.6.0)  Highlights:  - The yarnc command-line client now renders Twts in Markdown just like the Web Interface and Mobile App 🥳 - Blacklists 🏴‍☠️ it is not possbile for Pod Owner/Operators to "blacklist" feeds by a list of regex patterns. This should be used sparingly and as a last resort ⚠️ (also don't use a regex pattern of .* 😂) - Several new User Settings preferences:   - Time display preferences, 12h or 24h   - Open links preferences, new window or same window  Enjoy! 🤗
2021-11-05T23:06:45Z	🐞 **FIXED** [Releases - yarn - v0.6.1](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases)  Very sorry 😢 I fucked up in with the addition of hte User OpenLinksInPrefernece features added in 0.6.0 🤦‍♂️ This minor patch releases fixes a nasty nil pointer derefernece bug. Again sorry! 🙇‍♂️  **PLEASE** upgrade to 0.6.1+ 🙇‍♂️
2021-11-07T21:09:07Z	[Releases - yarn - v0.6.2](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases/tag/0.6.2)  > This is the second patch for the 0.6.x series of `yarnd` that fixes a few bugs. > In addition it also adds "Feed Rotation" via a `RotateFeeds()` job as this has become necessary now (_[@prologic](https://twtxt.net/~prologic) filled his feed! finally after 16 months!_). Feed rotation is performed at ~2am on a Sunday (weekly) and is controlled by the `-F/--max-fetch-limit` pod configuration.  Enjoy! 🤗 As usual send feedback to @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> 😅
2021-11-09T00:22:45Z	📣 **NEW:** [twtxt Developer Documentation : Archive Feeds Extension](https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/archivefeedsextension.html)  Announcing the "Archive Feeds Extension". Many thanks to @movq and @lyse for helping put this together 🙇‍♂️ This small little extension allows feed authors to "rotate" their feeds (_something that `yarnd` already does on a weekly basis_) so that we can continue to scale and grow years from now. Fun fact, my own feed @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> hit ~2.1M over the weekend and the default `-F/--max-fetch-limit` for `yarnd` is ~2MB so my feed stopped working 😅
2021-11-13T06:13:33Z	[Releases - yarn - v0.7.0](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases)  > This is _probably_ one of the biggest releases of `yarnd` in a while, there were a lot of bug fixes, improvements as well as a tonne of new features. 🥳  Highlights:  - Custom pages   The About, Privacy and Abuse pages can now be customised by Pod Owner/Operators.   To do so simply copy the builtin ones `cp -a internal/pages /path/to/data` or   just start creating matching pages in `/path/to/data/pages`.   Note that unfortunately at this time customising pages requires a restart of   the backend `yarnd` as page content is cached. - Login via Email   Users can now login with their email address in addition to their username   and password (_if set_). This feature can be enabled by Pod Owners/Operators   with the `magic_link_auth` feature flag. - Improved UX for Follow/Unfollow and Mute/Unmute buttons with graceful JS fallback! - Pod-level Timezone, Time format and Open links in preferences. - New `/custom` support for themes to serve arbitrary static assets   This new route allows Pod Owner/Operators to serve up arbitrary static assets   with any directory structure that cannot be easily served up by the existing   `/css/:commit`, `/img/:commit` and `/js/:commit` routes. Custom static assets   should be placed in a directory called `custom` under `/path/to/theme`.  As per usual, enjoy and happy Yarns 🤗  Please provide all feedback to @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or reply to this Yarn.

2021-11-30T02:17:06Z	🐞 **FYI:** For those of you that use the [feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net) service, it appears I pushed a commit that broke **ALL** external feeds (_no wonder my timeline has been a bit quietish of late 🤦‍♂️_). Very sorry about this, I _believe_ it is fixed now and you should get updates again from external feeds you _may_ follow. 🤗

2021-12-17T14:21:57Z	📣 **NEW:** Hey all 👋 Just wanted to announce the new "Cache Convergence" feature.  If you regularly run `yarnd` on `master`; please `git pull`, rebuild and enable the feature `converge`.  This will fill in missing twts found during a feed cache cycle by asking peering pods for the missing twt.  Testing so far has found the experimental feature `converge` to be working quite well 👌  cc @lohn @<eldersnake https://twtxt.net/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> @fastidious @xuu @lukas @ullarah @meff @laz @jlj
2021-12-19T23:40:19Z	📣 **NEW:** [Releases - yarn - v0.10.0](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases/tag/0.10.0)  This week in [Yarn](https://yarn.social) we have a brand new version of `yarnd` for you all with exciting new features! 🥳 Some of you have already been using them! 😅  Highlights:  - **NEW** Cache Convergence! -- Phantom Twts are no more! 👻 - **NEW** More UI/UX improvements all round! 🥳 - **NEW** Manage Jobs for Poderators ⚙️ - **FIXED** Fixed a few minor UI/UX bugs 🐞 (_despite the many listed bugs below, we #testinprod 🤣_)  Big thanks to @ullarah and @fastidious for all the PRs this week 😍 And a special thanks to @<markwylde https://twtxt.net/user/markwylde/twtxt.txt> for fixing the CSS animations! 🙇‍♂️  As per usual, please provide feedback to @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or reply to this Yarn 🤗
2022-01-01T00:35:39Z	📣 **NEW:** [Releases - yarn - v0.11.0](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases/tag/0.11.0)  Hello Yarners! 🤗  Happy New Year! #2021 #NewYearsEve 🥳  For those of you that live on _this_ side of the planet, Welcome to #2022 🥳  ----  This year in [Yarn](https://yarn.social) we have a brand new version of `yarnd` for you all with exciting new features! 🥳 Some of you have already been using them! 😅  Highlights:  - **NEW** Peers _try_ to validate the authenticity of injected Twts between peers.This has _finally_ #resolved the issue with my Avatar that kept reverting back and forth 😂 - **NEW** New `refresh` Metadata field added to the [Metadata ext](https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/metadataextension.html) allowing feed authors to _manually_ hint to clients as to how often their feeds should be fetched. - **NEW** Moving Average Feed Refresh (_currently in experimental_) feature (Enable with `moving_average_feed_refresh`) that automatically backs off fetching/refreshing feeds based on an exponential moving average of feed's update frequency. This helps to reduce traffic to pods and external feeds but keep the network convergent within 60s to 10m (_on-pod are always instantaneous_) 🚀 - **NEW** Improvements to the `yarnc timeline` command to support `-r/--reverse` and `-n/--twts` 🧑‍💻 - **NEW** Support for pruning old dead accounts a multi-user pod _might_ accumulate. This sends an email to the Pod Owner on a weekly basis and uses a heuristic score ranges from 1000 (_every user_) to 2993 (_users who have never posted, never updated any part of their profile_). A Poderator (_Pod Owner/Operator_) is sent a weekly candidates of up to 10 users with a score `> 1200` for consideration. 👻 - **NEW** Active Users. Pods now measure two key metrics a Poderator can track, Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active Users (MAU). These are only accurate to a day. 📈 - **NEW** New followers tracking that is now _actually_ accurate and is pruned once-per-week. So now your "Followers" count, even across pods **will** be accurate and up-to-date 🥳 - **FIXED** Finally squished that annoying bug 🐞 causing profile data to flip-flop - **FIXED** The `LookupHandler()` was fixed to support auto/tab-completion for external feeds! 🥳 - **UPDATE** Update Chinese and Taiwanese translations! 🇨🇳 🇹🇼  Big thanks to @gbmor for driving the need for some much needed network optimizations! Thanks again to @ullarah for the many UI/UX updates and improvements! 🙇‍♂️ And thank you again to @venjiang for updating the CN and TW translations! 👌  As per usual, please provide feedback to @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or reply to this Yarn 🤗
2022-01-01T12:01:57Z	📣 **FYI:** For those of you still on `yarn v0.10.x` you _might_ want to update past these revisions:  ``` * e7c423d 2022-01-01 | Remove Cached.IsDead() and Dead field and defer to humans for how to deal with possible dead feeds [James Mills] * ff89e56 2022-01-01 | Reduce the level of error logging in the Cache.FetechFeeds() (renamed) [James Mills] * d5230d2 2022-01-01 | Don't skip dead feeds for now [James Mills] ```  If you're running `v0.10.x` with some code I introduced to _try_ deal with potentially dead feeds automatically; that code is bupkis and totally b0rked 😅  Alternatively just upgrade to the latest `v0.11.x` that was recently released 🥳
2022-01-10T04:42:37Z	📣 **PSA:** All old `Twt.social` hosted pods I used to run for FREE way back when this project was under a different branding have all been **shut down** as per my announcement email (_sent ~91 days ago_) to all previous Pod Owner/Operators at _that_ time.  As promised, if this affects you in any way, I've taken backups. Happy to hand over the data to you.  If you would like to continue to use [Yarn.social](https://yarn.social), please join an existing pod or spin your own up, it's pretty easy to do! 👌 -- The "Hosted Pods" offering will come back soon™ Thank you! 🙇‍♂️
2022-01-10T10:50:40Z	🥳 **NEW:** Several new features are in `master` right now, waiting to be released for the upcoming `yarnd v0.12`.

Many thanks to @<ullarah https://txt.quisquiliae.com/user/ullarah/twtxt.txt> 🙇‍♂️ -- We will also be delaying the upcoming `yarn v0.13.x` release until next weekend.
2022-01-24T08:14:50Z	📣 **PSA:** At this point I _believe_ it is prudent to postpone the upcoming `yarn v0.13.x` release until this weekend. Sorry for any inconvenience (_probably none, since most current/active poderators seem to run the `main` branch anyway 😅_) -- Thank you! 🙇‍♂️

2022-02-05T04:07:23Z	📣 **NEW:** [Releases - yarn - v0.13.0 - Aluminium Amarok](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases/tag/0.13.0)  Hello Yarners! 🤗  What a month (_and a bit_) it has been! 😅 During this time we've closed out 78 Pull Requests, 55 Issues from the hard work of 8 contributors over 174 commits!  This release `yarnd v0.13` is **special** because this will be the last release for a while. The project will be entering a "feature freeze" whilst the developers and active contributors slow down a bit and work on some other much-needed components.  We will be working on improving documentation, deployment guides, builtin pages and other supporting services and components in the ecosystem. In addition a decision has been made to relicense all software components under a new license (AGPLv3) going forward. We hope this will not affect contributions in any way but will also serve to protect what we've all worked so hard to build.  But don't worry! We will still be committing to `main`, we just won't be adding and new significant new features for a while.  Without further ado, here are the following changes for our 0.12 release!  ## Highlights  First the important noteworthy bug-fixes: 🐞  - Fixed various rendering issues with `blockquote`(s) and code snippets. - Fixed image alt and title rendering - Fixed various Cache consistency bugs - Fixed privacy issue in "Mentions" view - Fixed support for WebMentions and cross-pod mentions - Fixed weird behaviour when accidentally posting an empty Twt  And finally the new shiny new features! 🥳  - Pod Owner/Operators (_Poderators_) can now edit Pod pages in `data/pages/<name>.md` and changes are reflected live! - Users that reply to someone they don't follow now correctly @-mention them. - Users can now @-mention cross-pod as well as any Twtxt-supported feed using the now well supported syntax @nick - Added first-class support for GIF(s) 🦋 Finally! 😅 - Added support for fetching feeds over gemini:// - Added support for Twitter Summary Card - Added support for pressing Escape to cancel a Reply - Added support for configuring Twts Per Page in Manage Pod  ----  As per usual, please provide feedback to @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or reply to this Yarn 🤗
2022-03-07T06:27:08Z	📣 **NEW:** I realize we're still in a "code freeze" for [Yarn.social](https://yarn.social)'s backend `yarnd`; however I wanted to share a new feature that just got built this weekend.  [WebSub](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/676)  This means the following two experimental features are not complementary and can hopefully both be promoted soon™ 🤞   - moving_average_feed_refresh  - websub  I would encourage anyone that normally runs `yarnd` from the `main` branch or the [prologic/yarnd:latest](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/prologic/yarnd) Docker Image to give this a try and report any issues you come across!  You can enable this feature `websub` or both `websub` and `moving_average_feed_refresh` in your [Manage Pod](/manage/pod) UI and entering the features there one per line and hitting "Save".  Thank you! 🙇‍♂️
2022-03-17T16:06:10Z	📣 **FYI:** I am going to have to temporarily shut down the global [search service](https://search.twtxt.net) as it's currently killing my infra with excessive CPU and I/O utilization. Sorry folks 😅 I will investigate why when I have time/bandwidth and try to address the "problem". 🤗
2022-03-25T14:53:23Z	This pod will be upgrading and restarting shortly...
2022-04-16T15:03:22Z	📣 **NEW:** There is now a permanent [Demo Pod](https://demo.yarn.social) available at https://demo.yarn.social as of today!  The [Yarn.social](https://yarn.social) landing page has also been updated to link to the Demo Pod too.  If ever you weren't sure wtf Yarn.social even is, or why it matters, you are more than welcome to play around with the Demo Pod, just be aware that it is isolated from the rest of the network, and we will wipe it at any time without warning or notice, it's just a demo 😅 (probably we'll wipe it only once per release of `yarnd` -- the software backend).
2022-05-14T04:20:04Z	📣 **NEW:** [Releases - yarn - v0.14.0](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases/tag/0.14.0)  # yarnd v0.14 Silicon Sphinx  Hello Yarners! 🤗  Long time no release!

2022-10-28T13:24:35Z	📣 **FYI:** This pod (twtxt.net) may restarts several times over the next few hours as I work on [v0.15](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/milestone/3) milestone issues and push them out to my pod live. If you see `404 Not Found` its just the Pod restarting, just check back in a minute.
2022-10-29T07:40:02Z	📣 **Release:** [yarn v0.15 - Phosphorus Phoenix](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases/tag/0.15.0)  Hello Yarners! 🤗  It's again been a long while since our [Last Release yarnd v0.14](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases/tag/0.14.0) over ~6 months ago! 😳 Sorry about that! 🙏 I guess we got a  bit busy with a few other things going on...  First of all a big thanks to everybody who has given all of their time and effort to help Yarn.social become a better platform every day.  A _special_ thanks to our new contributors @<tkanos https://twtxt.net/user/tkanos/twtxt.txt> and @<eaplmx https://twtxt.net/user/eaplmx/twtxt.txt> who recently started contributing to the project! Thank you! 🙏  Without further ado, here are the highlights for the 0.15 release!  ## Highlights  - **Twtxt Search Engine** -- The much improved [Twtxt Search Engine](https://search.twtxt.net) - **NEW** Sync API 🥳 (see below) - Add Block Quote button to the Postbox. - Add official "Feed Types" (see below)  Its a bit of a small(ish) release with no that many "big" new features (sorry!) mostly just bug fixes and little improvements. So if you're curious please see the full Change Log below.  ### Twtxt Search Engine  The **much improved** [Twtxt Search Engine](https://search.twtxt.net) is out which improves the index greatly, performance and overall functionality and UX.  Help pages have been improved and overall searches are "just better".  Check it out!  ### Sync API  For a [long time](https://search.twtxt.net/search?q=Sync+API&f=) we've talked about the possibility of "syncing" a local feed with your feed on a Yarn.social pod. This is now possible with a 3-way Sync API `/api/v1/sync` and a sub command of the `yarnc` command-line client. Usage is as simple as:  ```console $ yarnc sync twtxt.txt ```  See `yarnc sync --help` and the [Sync API (https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/api.html#sync) API endpoint documentation for more details.  ### Feed Types  In order to better improve the code and manageability of different feed types such as automated feeds (bots) and RSS / Atom feeds, we have defined a set of [Feed Types](https://pkg.go.dev/go.yarn.social/types#FeedType) namely:  - `rss` -- A Twtxt feed whose primary source comes from an RSS / Atom feed. - `bot` -- A Twtxt feed which is fully automated by some script or automation.  These are the **only** feed types currently and we do not expect any more really. The way this works is ti simply add `# type = rss|bot` to your feed if the feed you are publishing is a non-human/non-user feed. Omitting the `type` [Metadata](https://dev.twtxt.net/doc/metadataextension.html) is completely fine and optional. The default for all feeds is a User / Human feed.  This helps us categorize and filter out noise feeds, automated feeds from views like the "Discover" view on Yarn.social pods and serve as a way to "filter" for these types of feed in the [Twtxt Search Engine](https://search.twtxt.net).  ----  As per usual, please provide feedback to @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or reply to this Yarn 🤗
2022-10-29T12:34:48Z	🐞 **Hot Fix:** [yarn v0.15.1](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/releases) Please update if you already upgraded to `v0.15.0`, otherwise just skip to this version as it fixes a critical bug I caused (need to write those cache tests 😅)
2022-11-06T07:31:25Z	Hey all 👋 I've just update my pod at [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) to a "dev" branch to test [PR #1059](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/pulls/1059), please let me know if you experience any issues or regressions, bugs, etc 🙏 If everything is good after a few hours I will merge this PR and keep working. This is the new "Filter and Lists" feature... Thanks! 🙇‍♂️
2022-12-21T22:43:00Z	📣 **NEW:** For those that run a [Yarn.social](https://yarn.social) pod (_an instance of `yarnd`_) for their [Twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) needs for themselves, family and friends, please be aware of the following change/commit in `main` or `edge` (if you use the Docker image):  ``` * f3f1e429 2022-12-21 | Add configurable front page (anonymous discover view) behaviour (#1103) (HEAD -> main, origin/main) [James Mills] ```  Be aware that this change will by default make the front page of your pod display "local" posts only.
